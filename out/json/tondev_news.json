      "text": "üî• W5 Challenge Winners\n\nWe are pleased to announce results of the W5 optimization challenge. People were so much enthusiastic about W5 on TON Gateway'23, that‚Äôs incredible! On behalf of the entire TON community I express my gratitude to all the participants in our contest. Your part is a big step towards the future. \n\nTo underline this sentiment we decided to amend the original rules and increase the reward for the second and third place to make it even 1 TON per 1 gas unit saved on average for all winning participants (equivalent to 0.333 TON per each gas unit over three target execution paths, as per original rules).\n\nNow, let's announce the winners.\n\nü•á The first place goes to Skydev\n\nSkydev made two excellent contributions: a regular one and a more radical one, that involved patching the FunC compiler. \n\nSkydev's radical option achieved whopping savings of 2927 gas units over three usage scenarios (28% on average) and we assign a reward of 975 TON, or 1 TON for 1 gas unit saved on average.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nü•àThe second place goes to Davide Bartoli\n\nDavide‚Äôs contribution saved 796 gas units total (7.8% on average) and we assign a reward of 265 TON.\n\nü•â And the third place goes to Behrang Norouzinia\n\nBehrang's contribution was the most clean and straightforward and yet saved 506 gas units total (4.9% on average). And we assign a reward of 169 TON.\n \nConclusion\n\nGas price, rent price, and forwarding fees are necessary to protect the network against spam and reward validators for keeping consensus running. This is of the utmost importance because TON is a public resource shared by everyone. It is our duty as developers to make efficient use of this resource and produce the most optimal software possible. It‚Äôs doubly so for commonly used contracts such as a wallet.\n\n30% savings on a wallet contract would mean that a billion users transacting daily would save around $2-5 million each day in transaction costs, or about $1 billion annually.\n\nCongratulations to all the winners!\n\nWith love,\nTonkeeper Team üíô",

      "text": "TON20 Inscription Use-case on TON\nStarting on December 5th, The Open Network (TON) experienced an incredible spike in network activity, thanks to the BRC20 Bitcoin Ordinals type of inscription use-case, called TON20, launched by the Tonano team. \n\nProducing over 2 million transactions increased our network usage by 61 times within just half an hour. TON Community is proud to witness a creative use case take-off in TON driven by independent participants in the ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, this sudden growth has revealed many interesting insights for our blockchain. Dynamic sharding technology worked as expected. At its peak, TON split into eleven shardchains, stabilizing at five shardchains to handle the heavy load.\n\nAt the same time, this phenomenon also revealed where the community should work to swiftly onboard the exponential increase in network activity expected in the near future. Network validators must ensure that TON is supported by hardware capable of scaling to the performance demanded by high usage.\n\nNetwork Performance Delays\nThis peak interest also came with a severe congestion of TON network, where validation was severely delayed even though the network validators are still producing blocks. \n\nPopular wallets like @Wallet and Tonkeeper have paused the service temporarily.\n\nTON core developers are aware of the issues affecting users and are working on TON blockchain. An initial technical report is available here. TON core team will be providing us with a further update within the next 24 hours. \n\nWe thank you and the community for your patience and unwavering support as we go through the growing pains together, preparing for the unprecedented growth season expected in the near future.",

      "text": "üíé Wallet Pay update: autoconversion feature\n\nWallet Pay has received an important update ‚Äì the introduction of the autoconversion feature for all merchants on Telegram.\n\nAutoconversion allows sellers to specify their preferred cryptocurrency for receiving payments, regardless of the cryptocurrency customers use for goods or services in Telegram.\n\nHere's how it works\n\nWhen creating a payment order, merchants can enable autoconversion, choosing from three supported cryptocurrencies: TON, USDT, or BTC. When customers pay for a product or service on Telegram, merchants will receive the cryptocurrency specified in the autoconversion parameters.\n\nDo you have an example?\n\nCertainly, imagine you sell virtual reality headsets and have enabled autoconversion to USDT. If a customer purchases the cutting-edge gadget with BTC, you'll receive payment in USDT instantly (Wallet Pay will automatically convert the crypto at the market rate).\n\nFor more details on autoconversion terms and to apply to connect Wallet Pay to your service, visit this link: https://pay.wallet.tg üëà",

We removed support for setdata and setcode actions,\n2. Wallet enforces sendmode flag 2 for all \"send message\" actions.\n3. The wallet ABI is still compatible with original \"wrapped C5 register\" design, meaning that it is possible to swap out safe version of the wallet for unsafe one and still be able to use existing SDKs and tools without modification. (Might be useful in specific high-load usage on masterchain to save fees.)\n\nAlso, compared to revision 1:\n4. New optimizations are added throughout by the contest winner @Skydev.\n5. New operation type is available: turning signature verification on and off. This is an important feature for account recovery and migration use-cases, and it completes the authentication scope: wallet can be authenticated by signature and/or extension, in any combination of the two. For safety, sig auth cannot be disabled when there is no extension installed to avoid complete lockout.\n\nProject timeline\n\nAug 2023 ‚Äî initial sketch\nSept 2023 ‚Äî first working revision\nOct 2023 ‚Äî optimization challenge\nNov 2023 ‚Äî feedback & design review with TON community\nJan 2024 ‚Äî revision 2 early preview\nFeb/Mar 2024 ‚Äî audit & peer review\nMar 2024 ‚Äî experimental support in Tonkeeper Pro\n\nWe are eager to get your feedback, please let us know what you think!\n\nüí¨ Discussion group for W5: https://t.me/+yNtJhu0BS6lmYWI0",

      "text": "üîß Introducing TON Replay\n\nAs our blockchain ecosystem thrives with countless developers and projects, evolving becomes a cautious task. Changes could unpredictably impact the ecosystem, making upgrades a slow and meticulous process. Often, theoretical issues might not even affect real-world applications.\n\nüåü But, there's a breakthrough! TON Core has launched the TON Replay project to tackle this challenge. The first fruit of this initiative is TonTVMReplay, developed by DTON. This tool emulates historical transactions on updated versions of the TON Virtual Machine (TVM). This means we can now test how real projects react to upgrades or network configuration changes before implementing them, ensuring smoother and safer evolution.\n\nüîç Looking Ahead: TON Replay isn't stopping there. We're developing advanced features for smarter checks. The goal is to ensure the practical outcomes of transactions‚Äîlike transfers, swaps, and more‚Äîremain consistent, even if the transactions themselves change. This will enable us to run mirror networks and make significant, yet safe, modifications to the transaction executor.\n\nüõ† More from DTON: Besides TonTVMReplay, DTON is also behind other developer-friendly projects, such as their blockchain index dton.io and the recently launched LSaaS (liteserver-as-a-service) via @liteserver_bot."

Your submission must precisely represent the provided design ‚Äì this includes all elements, their proportions and position on the screen, as well as their animations and transitions.\n\nRequired Functionality (Screens)\n1. Auth Flow, including both creating and importing wallets.\n2. Main Screen listing all user's tokens and recent transactions.\n3. Transaction Info Modal featuring several transaction types.\n\nDetails\nWhile the task involves developing a new Swift app, some existing code from our current JavaScript app must be reused. Specifically, the API and blockchain integrations (which is already standalone and currently exposed as a web worker). To achieve this, a bridge must be implemented to allow running JavaScript process from the Swift environment (e.g., in an invisible WebView). This approach enables leveraging our existing API abstractions and focusing on the UI part without delving deeply into blockchain-related programming.\n\nEvaluation Criteria\nDuring the evaluation stage our judges will test the submissions on a broad range of iOS devices. The key factors that will be used to determine the best apps are:\n\n¬∑ The general aesthetics of the app.\n¬∑ Adherence to the provided mockups and design elements. \n¬∑ Attention to the tiniest details in the user experience.\n\nThe smoothness of animations and the overall stability of the app will play a major role. Last but not least is the absence of significant flaws (including crashes, performance issues, battery drains, visual glitches, noticeable element blinking, layout imperfections and more). \n\nSubmissions\nContestants will be able to submit their entries to @MyTonWalletBot. We will further clarify the submission instructions closer to the deadline.",

The Battery covers payments, staking, swaps and more with any tokens and NFTs. In just one month, Battery relayed almost 1,000,000 transactions covering over $100,000 in fees.\n\nToday we are making a big step forward: ‚ö°Ô∏èfast gasless payments in USDT‚ö°Ô∏è. Users do not have to charge the Battery: transaction fees are paid directly from the USDT balance.\n\nGasless USDT transfers in Tonkeeper work 2x faster and 1.5x cheaper than in any other wallet. This is possible thanks to a new wallet architecture called üî•W5 ‚Äî an open wallet standard developed by Tonkeeper team to replace the existing standard version 4. üî•W5 is available as beta release today in Tonkeeper on iOS and Android.\n\nTo try Gasless Transactions:\n\n1. Update Tonkeeper to version 4.6.1\n\n2. Tap ‚ÄúUSDT‚Äù and select ‚ÄúTry W5 Wallet‚Äù\n\n3. Add the ‚ÄúW5‚Äù wallet alongside a current wallet and send some USDT to it\n\n4. Pay with USDT and Notcoin without TON!\n\nTo learn more about these new product features check out our next post: üëâ¬†Tonkeeper Battery, Gasless and W5.\n\nDownload Tonkeeper: tonkeeper.com\nFollow: en ¬∑ ru ¬∑ ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å ¬∑ twitter",

Its previous big contribution was the TON Connect protocol, which eventually became the unified protocol for applications and wallets in the TON network.\n\nIn this year, the Tonkeeper team has proposed a new v5-beta version of the wallet smart contract. In beta mode, Tonkeeper Wallet has launched support for this new version.\n \nIn addition to retaining the previous functionality (v4), the new contract allows you to send up to 255 messages at a time, as well as to make full-fledged gasless transactions (e.g. payment of network fees when transferring USDt in USDt itself) and other features.\n\nHaving studied the contract, we believe it will enhance the usability and capabilities for TON users.\n\nThe TON Core team is starting to audit and test this v5-beta smart contract. The smart contract code will change in the course of this work, but we will try to keep its interface intact. The TON Core team plan to complete this work by June 20.\n\nWe ask all wallets in the TON ecosystem to support the final smart contract after the audit.\n\nUI:\n\n‚Äî Already now wallet teams can start UI preparations. You can use the v5-beta smart contract as a test smart contract, but keep in mind that it will change.\n\n‚Äî UI suggestion: wallets that have multi-accounts could support the new v5 smart contract as a separate account in the UI. Provide a ‚ÄúTransfer funds between your accounts‚Äù functionality.\n\nBeta:\n\n‚Äî If you build v5 functionality into public versions of your products - please mark it as ‚Äúbeta‚Äù and do not use v5 contract by default, but only when explicitly enabled in the settings. Please observe this rule to prevent too wide distribution of the non final beta version of the v5 smart contract.\n\nRelease:\n\n‚Äî The final smart contract will be ready around June 20, after which wallets can enable v5 by default using the final smart contract."

When sending an USDt the user signs one message containing two outgoing USDt transfers:\n\n1.1. USDt transfer to the recipient's address.\n\n1.2. Transfer of a small amount of USDt in favor of the Service.\n\n2. This signed message is sent offchain by HTTPS to the Service backend. The Service backend sends it to the TON blockchain paying Toncions for network fees.\n\nThe Tonkeeper team announced the launch of the beta version of such public backend on June 14. Backend will support the USDt and the NOT.\n\nAlthough each wallet could launch its own backend, we believe that a single backend would be more convenient if there are network-wide subsidy campaigns. However, the final choice is up to you.\n\nWe invite TON wallets to support gasless transactions for USDt (and NOT) by June 20, by the time the v5 wallet smart contract is finalized."

The foreach loop for the Map type:\n\nlet mapLength: Int = 0;\nforeach (k, v in map) {\n  mapLength += 1;\n}\n\n\nYou don't have to use map.set(key, null) to remove a key from your maps, use the more intuitive del method instead: map.del(key).\n\nWant to check if the map is empty? Use map.isEmpty()!\n\nüî§ Strings \n\nStrings finally support escape sequences, like \\\\, \\\", \\n, \\u0000 through \\uFFFF, etc.\n\nThere is a new non-modifying StringBuilder's concat method for chained string concatenations: b = b.concat(\"Hello,\").concat(foo).concat(\"Tact!\").\n\nWe added the toString method for the Address type that you asked for numerous times in the dev chats: address(\"EQBKgXCNLPexWhs2L79kiARR1phGH1LwXxRbNsCFF9doc2lN\").toString().\n\nüëå Handling exceptions\n\nWant to process various TVM and user-defined exit codes before your contract fails at runtime? The try and try-catch statements: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/statements#try-catch:\n\n\ntry {\n    let foo: Int = 42 / 0;\n} catch(e) {\n    // your division by zero handler\n}\n\n\n‚òÄÔ∏è New quality-of-life improving syntax\n\nTact started supporting struct fields punning, i.e. {foo, bar} is syntactic sugar for { foo: foo, bar: bar }.\n\nThere is support for trailing commas in all comma-separated lists in Tact, here is how you can use it with structs:\n  \n  foo(Struct {\n    field1: 42,\n    field2: \"42\",\n  })\n  \n\nYou can now chain method calls with the unboxing operator !!, e.g. map.asCell()!!.hash().\n\nFor those missing some bit-level hackery, there is the bitwise XOR operator ^ available now.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Stdlib enhancements \n\nThe Tact team has added log2 and log, pow2 and pow functions.\n\nUse reserve mode constants from @stdlib/reserve instead of their numeric values to make your code even easier to read: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve-base-modes.\n\nüß† Debugging\n\nDebugging has become easier now as the dump() and dumpStack() functions now print the file path, line number, and column number in addition to the data specified by the programmer.\n\nAddresses can be arguments of the dump function.\n\nüíª Tact CLI\n\nTact's command line interface just became a lot more user-friendly: run npx tact --help from terminal and see what's available.\n\nJust a highlight: CLI now allows compiling a single Tact file directly, without specifying a config file: npx tact your-awesome-contract.tact. It's very useful for quick experiments or bug reports.\n\nüõ† Third-party tools support \n\nFor third-party tools implementors there is new improved APIs: AST traversals, access to the AST store of top-level items like functions, constants, traits, etc.\n\nHappy hacking! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nCheck out Tact's CHANGELOG for the comprehensive list of features, changes and bugfixes.\n\nCheck out the Tact docs and read about the new Tact features.\n\nTo upgrade your Blueprint-based Tact projects to use Tact v1.3.1, run npm upgrade inside the project folder.\n\nThis release was brought to you by 0kenx, byakuren-hijiri, Max Korsunov, Novus Nota, Vitor Py, Daniil Sedov, and Anton Trunov."

Here are the highlights of the most important features.\n\nüõ† New Tact features\n\nasm functions allow you to access the deep dark corners of TVM for more features or better performance: \n\n\nasm fun keccak256(s: Slice): Int {\n    1 INT HASHEXT_KECCAK256\n}\n\n\nasm functions have some limitations at this point and the Tact team will make them even more powerful in the next releases.\n\n- A wider range of serialization options for integers can now be used, not just 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256-bit integers, but anything in between: uint1 through uint256 and int1 through int257. For instance, a 48-bit timestamp can be defined now if you'd like to build contracts that can work after the year 2038:\n\n\ncontract Contract {\n    timestamp: Int as uint48\n}\n\n\n- Constant definitions now support calls to user-defined functions and references to other constants:\n\n\nconst CONSTANT: Int =\n    myFunction(OTHER_CONSTANT)\n\n\nüë©‚Äçüíª New builtin and stdlib functions and methods\n\n- The exists method for the Map type: m.exists(key) which is equivalent to m.get(key) != null.\n\n- The deepEquals method for the Map type: m1.deepEquals(m2) -- you can now easily compare two maps with the same key-value pairs and get true as the result, even if their internal representations are different, so the hash-based == comparison would return false.\n\n- The toSlice method for structs and messages: struct.toSlice().\n\n- The new slice, rawSlice, ascii and crc32 built-in compile-time functions to help you define constant integers and slices more conveniently.\n\n- The new stdlib functions to help with fee calculations: gasConsumed, getComputeFee, getStorageFee, getForwardFee, getSimpleComputeFee, getSimpleForwardFee, getOriginalFwdFee, myStorageDue. This brings you access to the TVM instructions from 2023.07 and 2024.04 upgrades.\n\n- The parseStdAddress and parseVarAddress stdlib functions allow you to parse slices into structured addresses.\n\nüêû The new release also includes a bunch of bugfixes. Thanks to all the Tacticians for all the issues you open!\n\nüìú Full changelog for Tact v1.5.0: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#150---2024-09-15"

It is a jetton that can be instantly distributed to hundreds of millions of users on the TON blockchain, with network fees costing less than a dollar. The user's ownership of their coins is guaranteed by cryptography and a smart contract.\n\nAs an example, we created a test jetton called Mintless Points (for testing purposes only, no other value) and distributed it to 18 million wallets in the TON mainnet.\n\nThis jetton is compatible with regular jetton in TON. The only difference is that the smart contact is not created in advance, but during the user's first action. \n\nPopular TON ecosystem products such as Tonkeeper, MyTonWallet, Tonviewer, Tonscan.org, TON API, DTON, Toncenter have announced that they will soon support Mintless Jetton technology.\n\nWe encourage all products and services in the ecosystem to consider integration as well.\n\nOn September 26, the famous game project Hamster Kombat will apply this technology during its coin giveaway. Considering Hamster Kombat's gigantic audience, this event has all chances to become the largest airdrop in the history of cryptocurrencies.\n\nDescription ¬ª\n\nStandard ¬ª\n\nSmart Contract ¬ª"

Both can set individually for each user, but also can be the same for all users. For example for \"Mintless Points\" test jettons the deadline will expire tomorrow. HamsterCoins will start tomorrow and claiming deadline will expire in three years."

      "text": "Good news, everyone!\n\nWe are excited to announce the launch of our webhook service. \n(Actually, there might still be some issues like delivery delays, but the API is stabilized.) \n\nWhat is it and why do you need it? \nTON is renowned for its scalability, meaning more transactions and blocks are added to the blockchain every second. In last year's stress tests, a record of 100,000 transactions per second was set. This means the blockchain generated over 100 megabytes of blocks per second or about a gigabit of incoming traffic if you want to view the entire blockchain. Of course, not every service needs to view all transactions in all blocks to find valuable insights. \nTo solve this problem, we are launching a webhook service that allows you to subscribe only to the data you need. Our service will attempt to deliver messages at increasing intervals until your server returns a 200 response.\n\nCurrent subscription options:\n\n1. Subscription to specific accounts - You can subscribe to a million accounts, and if a transaction occurs on any of them, we will notify you. Charges are based on the number of monitored account-days and each event.\n\n2. Subscription to specific opcodes of incoming messages - If any account receives an incoming message with such an opcode, we will notify you. Up to 100 opcodes per account. Charges are based on the number of events.\n\n3. Subscription to new accounts in the network - Don't require description. Charges only for the number of messages.\n\n4. Subscription to the mempool - We send all externals we see before they are included in the blockchain. Charges for each sent message, and no retries. If your server was unavailable, we will not attempt to resend.\n\nTry it!  Or read the docs first!\n\nWe welcome any feedback in comments to this post.",

I have created a giant roadmap (40 PDF pages!) describing the vision, and how, step by step, we're going to reach it.\n\nThroughout all December, I've been constantly working on the compiler's kernel. As you know, Tolk is a fork of FunC. FunC compiler internals are very challenging to be extended and modified. The way FunC looks like is just a mirror of its internal implementation. Heading towards the future, I had to partially \"untangle\" this \"legacy FunC core\", so that in the future, it will be able to \"interbreed\" with features it was not originally designed for.\n\nCurrently I am done with this preparation. Tolk v0.7 has just been released. It contains a fully rewritten semantic analysis kernel (though almost invisible to the end user, huh).\n\n‚úÖ Notable changes in Tolk v0.7:\n1. Under the hood: refactor and revamp compiler internals. AST-level semantic analysis kernel\n2. Under the hood: rewrite the type system from Hindley-Milner to static typing\n3. Clear and readable error messages on type mismatch\n4. Generic functions¬†fun f<T>(...)¬†and instantiations like¬†f<int>(...)\n5. The¬†bool¬†type\n6. Type casting via¬†value as T\n\nPR on GitHub with detailed info. IDE plugins are updated accordingly.\n\nBTW, a new version of blueprint was also released. You can now update compilers (Tolk / FunC / Tact) independently, they became peer dependencies.\n\nP.S. I'll uncover the details about planned Tolk v1.0 quite soon.",

The most important (and breaking) change is the fact that since blueprint v0.28.0 compilers (func-js, tolk, tact) have become peer dependencies. This means that you can pick and choose any compiler version that you need, as long as its API is compatible with what blueprint expects, but this also means that you need to have them listed in your package.json. If you're creating a new project using create-ton, it will add compiler dependencies automatically. If not and if you're upgrading blueprint in an old project, you will have to install compilers yourself, you can use the template's package.json for reference.\n\nChanges to sandbox and test-utils include better support for extra currencies, which might be of use due to the recent developments in TON.",

      "text": "Tolk v0.8: preparation for structures\n\nA new version of Tolk was released several days ago. We're starting a way to eventually implement structures with auto packing to/from cells. This will take several steps (each publicly released), it's the first one.\n\n‚úÖ Notable changes in Tolk v0.8:\n1. Syntax¬†tensorVar.0¬†and¬†tupleVar.0, both for reading and writing\n2. Allow¬†cell,¬†slice, etc. to be valid identifiers\n\nPR on GitHub with detailed info.\n\nUsing syntax¬†`tensorVar.{i}`¬†and¬†`tupleVar.{i}`, you can access tensors/tuples by indices without unpacking them.\n\nIt works for tensors:\n\nvar t = (5, someSlice, someBuilder);   // 3 stack slots\nt.0                     // 5\nt.0 = 10;               // t is now (10, ...)\nt.0 += 1;               // t is now (11, ...)\nincrement(mutate t.0);  // t is now (12, ...)\nt.0.increment();        // t is now (13, ...)\n\nt.1         // slice\nt.100500    // compilation error\n\n\nIt works for tuples (does asm INDEX/SETINDEX under the hood):\n\nvar t = [5, someSlice, someBuilder];   // 1 tuple on a stack with 3 items\nt.0                     // \"0 INDEX\", reads 5\nt.0 = 10;               // \"0 SETINDEX\", t is now [10, ...]\nt.0 += 1;               // \"0 INDEX\" to read 10, \"0 SETINDEX\" to write 11\nincrement(mutate t.0);  // also, the same way\nt.0.increment();        // also, the same way\n\nt.1         // \"1 INDEX\", it's slice\nt.100500    // compilation error\n\n\nIt works for nesting¬†var.{i}.{j}. It works for nested tensors, nested tuples, tuples nested into tensors. It works for¬†mutate. It works for globals.\n\nWhy is this essential?\n\nIn the future, we'll have structures, declared like this:\n\nstruct User {\n    id: int;\n    name: slice;\n}\n\n\nStructures¬†will be stored like tensors on a stack:\n\nvar u: User = { id: 5, name: \"\" };\n// u is actually 2 slots on a stack, the same as\nvar u: (int, slice) = (5, \"\");\n\nfun getUser(): User { ... }\n// on a stack, the same as\nfun getUser(): (int, slice) { ... }\n\n\nIt means, that¬†`obj.{field}`¬†is exactly the same as¬†`tensorVar.{i}`:\n\nvar u: User = ...;   // u: (int, slice) = ...\nu.id;                // u.0\nu.id = 10;           // u.0 = 10\n\n\nSame goes for nested objects:\n\nstruct Storage {\n    lastUpdated: int;\n    owner: User;\n}\n\ns.lastUpdated        // s.0\ns.owner.id           // s.1.0\n\n\nSo, implementing indexed access for tensors/tuples covering all scenarios is a direct step towards structures.",

Prior to v1.6.0, Tact's gas usage on many common contracts, such as Jettons, was far from ideal, requiring about 2.5 times gas of the FunC reference implementation.\n\nBut with Tact 1.6.0, those old gas-expensive days are long gone.\n\nü§Ø For example, a Tact rewrite of the reference FunC Jetton code consumes less gas for transfer, burn and discovery messages!\nüòé So, expect to receive easy-to-use idiomatic Tact implementations of common contracts in the near future\n\nSome of the things we did to achieve this:\n‚ñ™Ô∏è Removed \"system\" cell ‚Äî parent contract code is no longer stored in the system cell with all the child contract codes\n‚ñ™Ô∏è Removed redundant address checks\n‚ñ™Ô∏è Deprecated Deployable trait in favor of receive(){}\n‚ñ™Ô∏è Introduced contract parameters as an alternative to init() function\n\nAnd optimized compiler internals, many old and new functions in the stdlib:\n\nüß∞ Some of the standard library additions and changes\n\n‚Ä¢ Added specialized deploy and message functions for efficient on-chain deployments and non-deployment messages respectively\n‚Ä¢ Many math functions, such as divc, mulShiftRightCeil, and others\n‚Ä¢ More advanced functions, such as setGasLimit, setSeed, myCode, and others\n‚Ä¢ Handy throwIf and throwUnless functions, which deprecated their \"native\" prefixed counterparts\n‚Ä¢ Optimized emptyCell and emptySlice functions\n‚Ä¢ Int.toString function now consumes up to 64% less gas\n‚Ä¢ Int.toFloatString function now consumes up to 62% less gas\n\nAdded many functions for Cell, Slice and Builder types:\n‚Ä¢  Variable integer serialization types and the corresponding .load and .store functions of Slice and Builder types\n‚Ä¢ Functions Slice.hashData and String.hashData for efficient hashes of data only\n‚Ä¢ Functions for working with addresses: Slice.asAddress, Slice.asAddressUnsafe, contractHash, and a new BasechainAddress type its helper functions\n‚Ä¢ ...and more!\n\nüß≥ More auxiliary things\n\n‚Ä¢ Basic let-destructuring of structs and Messages\n‚Ä¢ Compile-time method ID expressions for getters and Message opcodes\n‚Ä¢ The codeOf expression to get the code of child contracts\n‚Ä¢ More map improvements and new methods, like replace and replaceGet\n‚Ä¢ New augmented assignment operators &&=, ||=, >>= and <<=\n‚Ä¢ Better error reporting for many cases\n‚Ä¢ Generation of constants in TypeScript wrappers\n‚Ä¢ The -w, --watch CLI flags for watching for changes and automatic recompilations\n‚Ä¢ CLI for the Tact's TVM disassembler ‚Äî unboc\n‚Ä¢ Fixes of the compilation report\n‚Ä¢ Fixes of the compiler's third-party API\n‚Ä¢ Fixes of the internal infrastructure and code generation\n‚Ä¢ Lots of other miscellaneous bug fixes and smaller enhancements\n‚Ä¢ ...and documentation for all of that and beyond!\n\nBesides, check out the updated Awesome Tact list and add your awesome projects, especially those using Tact in production!\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes\n\nThere are only two, and they're both pretty minor:\n\n‚Ä¢ Tact 1.6.0 replaces Context.bounced field with Context.bounceable, which tells whether the received message can bounce back or not. Previously, the bounced was useless since any bounced messages would be handled in a separate bounced() receiver.\n\n‚Ä¢ The enabledMasterchain option was removed from tact.config.json.

This patch mainly focused on polishing things in the internal infrastructure, standard library, and public APIs.\n\nüõ† Bug fixes\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è The multiple wildcard function parameters are now supported.\n\nThat is, the following works in v1.6.1:\n\n\ntrait WildThing {\n    // Using wildcards for parameter names\n    virtual fun assure(_: Int, _: Int): Bool {\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n\ncontract YouMakeMyHeartSing with WildThing {\n    // And then overriding them with concrete names\n    override fun assure(a: Int, b: Int): Bool {\n        return a + b == b + a;\n    }\n}\n\n‚ñ™Ô∏è Made calls to the .toCell() function on struct as a contract field handled correctly.\n\n\nstruct MyStruct { x: Int; y: Int; z: Int }\n\ncontract MyContract(myField: MyStruct) {\n    receive() {\n        // This works fine now:\n        self.reply(self.myField.toCell());\n    }\n}\n\nüß∞ Standard library additions and changes\n\n‚Ä¢ Added the StateInit.hasSameBasechainAddress() function, which is a gas-efficient way to check whether the given initial package corresponds to a specified address.\n\n‚Ä¢ Added the cashback() function to efficiently forward excess funds from an incoming message to the target address.\n\n‚Ä¢ All entities in Core libraries received documentation comments. Next time, we'll add missing doc comments for the standard libraries, i.e., everything imported using the import \"@stdlib/...\" syntax.\n\nüß≥ Some other changes:\n\n‚Ä¢ We've inlined the contract load functions, so the gas consumption of the benchmarked Jetton implementation in Tact is even smaller than that of its reference implementation in FunC.\n\n‚Ä¢ The TypeScript wrappers now produce bi-directional mappings of exit codes from their numbers to string descriptions and vice versa.

The compiler prevents using nullable values without checks, but thanks to smart casts, this feels smooth and natural.\n\n‚úÖ Notable changes in Tolk v0.9:\n\n1. Nullable types int?, cell?, etc.; null safety\n2. Standard library updated to reflect nullability\n3. Smart casts, like in TypeScript in Kotlin\n4. Operator ! (non-null assertion)\n5. Code after throw is treated unreachable\n6. The never type\n\nPR on GitHub with detailed info.\n\n‚úî Nullable types and null safety\n\nIn FunC, null was implicitly assignable to any primitive type ‚Äî too permissive. A variable declared as int could still hold null at runtime, leading to TVM exceptions if used incorrectly.\n\nTolk now forces you to explicitly mark nullable values. This aligns with TypeScript T | null and Kotlin, preventing unintended null usage.\n\n\nvalue = x > 0 ? 1 : null;  // int?\n\nvalue + 5;               // error\ns.storeInt(value);       // error\n\nif (value != null) {\n    value + 5;           // ok\n    s.storeInt(value);   // ok\n}\n\n\n* any type can be nullable: cell?, [int, slice]?, (int, cell)?\n* no more unexpected TVM exceptions due to null\n* at runtime, int? and cell? occupy just one stack slot ‚Äî zero overhead\n\n‚úî Smart casts (via control flow graph)\n\nOnce a nullable value is checked, the compiler automatically refines its type:\n\nif (lastCell != null) {\n    // here lastCell is `cell`, not `cell?`\n}\n\n\nor:\n\nif (lastCell == null || prevCell == null) {\n    return;\n}\n// both lastCell and prevCell are `cell`\n\n\nor:\n\nvar x: int? = ...;\nif (x == null) {\n    x = random();\n}\n// here x is `int`\n\n\nSmart casts ensure code is safe while remaining gas-efficient (compile-time only).\n\n‚úî Operator `!` (non-null assertion)\n\nIf you know a value can't be null, use the ! operator to bypass nullability checks:\n\n// this key 100% exists, make it `cell`, not `cell?`\nvalidators = getBlockchainConfigParam(16)!;\n\n\nIt's useful for low-level TVM functions (dicts, particularly), when you have guarantees outside the code. Use with care!\n\n‚úî The `never` type\n\nNow, you can declare \"always-throwing functions\":\n\nfun alwaysThrows(): never {\n    throw 123;\n}\n\nfun f() {\n    ...\n¬† ¬† alwaysThrows();¬† // no return needed after this\n}\n\n\nnever also occurs implicitly when a condition is impossible:\n\nvar v = 0;\n// compiler warning: `int` can never be `null`\nif (v == null) {\n¬† ¬† // v is `never`\n}\n\n\n... this is just the beginning! Nullable tensors, tricky smart casts, and low-level null safety details ‚Äî all explained in the PR.\n\nüå≥ Null safety is smooth, intuitive, and enforced at compile time ‚Äî no runtime cost, no extra gas, just safer code.",

Fixed-size integer types: int32, uint64, etc.\n2. Type coins and function ton(\"0.05\")\n3. Types bytesN and bitsN (backed by slices at TVM)\n4. Replace \"...\"c postfixes with stringCrc32(\"...\") functions\n5. Trailing comma support\n\nPR on GitHub with detailed info.\n\n‚ùì Fixed-size integers? In TVM? What?\n\nImagine Tolk already has structures, and we define an incoming message:\n\nstruct CounterIncrement {\n    counter_id: int;\n    inc_by: int;\n}\n\n\nA client sends this message following the TL/B schema:\n\ncounterIncrement \n    counter_id:int32 \n    inc_by:int64\n    = CounterIncrement;\n\n\nBut how do we tell the compiler that counter_id is int32 and inc_by is int64? This information is missing in the struct definition.\n\n‚úñ Rejected approaches: why they fail\n\nSeveral syntax ideas were considered:\n\n\n// type casting?\ncounter_id: int as int32; \ninc_by: int as int64;\n\n// inline annotations?\ncounter_id: int @int32;\ninc_by: int @int64;\n\n// annotations above fields?\n@serialize(int32)\ncounter_id: int;\n@serialize(int64)\ninc_by: int;\n\n\nEach of these quickly breaks down when handling more complex cases. \n\nFor example, how would we handle TL-B Maybe int32? Would we write:\n\n// this?\ninc_by: (int as int32)?;\n// or this?\ninc_by: int? as int32?;\n// or this?\ninc_by: Maybe<int> as Maybe<int32>;\n\n\nAnd what about TL/B Both (Maybe int32) int64?\n\n// this?\nmy_data: Both<Maybe<int as int32>, int as int64>;\n// or this?\nmy_data: Both<Maybe<int>, int> as Both<Maybe<int32>, int64>;\n// or how??\n\n\nWith every new case, the syntax becomes more complex, ambiguous, and error-prone.\n\n‚úî The solution: `int32` as a first-class type\n\n\nstruct CounterIncrement {\n    counter_id: int32;\n    inc_by: int64;\n}\n\n\nNo annotations. No confusing as syntax. No ambiguity.\n\nThis scales perfectly:\n\nstruct MyMsg {\n    inc_by: int32?;\n    my_data: (int32?, int64);\n}\n\n\nThese are distinct types. A variable can be int32 and similar:\n\nvar op: int32 = ...;\nvar query_id: uint64 = ...;\n\n\nThis makes serialization predictable, structured, and error-free.\n\n‚úî What about overflow?\n\nA reasonable question: what happens if a value exceeds the limit?\n\nvar v: uint8 = 255;\nv += 1;    // ???\n\n\nAnswer: no runtime overflow or clamping! It's just int at TVM.\n\n* arithmetic works normally ‚Äì v becomes 256\n* no extra gas cost ‚Äì no runtime bounds checks\n* overflow will only happen at serialization\n\n\nstruct Resp {\n    outValue: uint8;\n}\n\nresp.outValue = v;   // 256\nresp.toCell();       // a runtime \"overflow\" error\n\n\n‚úî Why is this the best approach?\n\nThink of smart contracts as a black box:\n- inputs are encoded (int32, uint64, etc.)\n- inside the contract, arithmetic uses full 257-bit precision\n- outputs are serialized again ‚Äî overflow happens only at this stage\n\nThis is similar to how mulDivFloor(x,y,z) uses 513-bit precision internally. Your contract keeps precision internally and only enforces constraints at the border with an outside world.\n\nüå≥ Tolk will follow a type-based philosophy\n\nThis post covered the foundation of automatic serialization. The right way is to have a rich type system. Having nested types, having generics, having aliases ‚Äî will allow to describe every practical TL/B case, but at a language level.\n\nIn v0.10, we introduce intN (fixed integers), bytesN (definite slices), coins (variadic integers), and some more additions. Read the details in the PR.\n\nHow will Either L R and even more complex TL/B structures be expressed? \nStay tuned for the next update...",

No performance overhead ‚Äî a compile-time feature.\n\n‚úî Union types `T1 | T2 | ...`\n\nThey now allow a variable to hold multiple possible types. \n\n\nfun whatFor(a: bits8 | bits256): slice | UserId { ... }\n\nvar result = whatFor(...);  // slice | UserId\n\n\nNullable types T? are now formally T | null. \n\nAt the TVM level, union types work as tagged unions ‚Äî similar to Rust enums but more flexible.\n\n‚úî Pattern matching\n\nThe only way to work with union types is matching them:\n\n\nmatch (result) {\n    slice  => { /* result is slice here  */ }\n    UserId => { /* result is UserId here */ }\n}\n\n\nMatching is based on smart casts ‚Äî inside each branch, the variable is automatically narrowed to the matched type.\n¬†\nIt can also be used as an expression:\n\n\ntype Pair2 = (int, int);\ntype Pair3 = (int, int, int);\n\nfun getLast(tensor: Pair2 | Pair3) {\n    return match (tensor) {\n        Pair2 => tensor.1,\n        Pair3 => tensor.2,\n    }\n}\n\n\nSo, `match` + smart casts are our way for union types. You may notice that it's close to enums in Rust. But we don't have enum. Union types are more general and powerful.\n\n‚úî `match` for expressions\n\n\nval nextValue = match (curValue) {\n    1 => 0,\n    0 => 1,\n    else => -1\n};\n\n\nAs you see, match also works for constant expressions, similar to switch in other languages.\n\n‚úî Union types and TL/B `Either`\n\nT1 | T2 will be directly mapped to TL-B (Either T1 T2). \nLook how clean this is: (Either SmallPayload LargePayload) becomes\n\n\nstruct StoragePart {\n    data: SmallPayload | LargePayload;\n    // (de)serialized as '0' + ... or '1' + ...\n}\n\nmatch (s.data) {\n    SmallPayload => ...\n    LargePayload => ...\n}\n\n\nNo need to manually handle bits from the slice ‚Äî it's naturally expressed in the type system!\n\n‚úî Union types and TL/B constructors\n\nT1 | T2 | ... is a typed way to describe multiple constructors from TL/B. Generally, they can be used anywhere inside a storage or a message. \n\nMoreover ‚Äî handling incoming messages is beautifully expressed with union types.\n\n‚úî Union types and future structures\n\nThe ultimate goal? You'll describe each incoming message as a struct, create a union type for them, parse a slice, and just match over variants:\n\n\n// don't mind about opcodes yet\nstruct CounterIncBy { byValue: int32 }\nstruct CounterReset {}\nstruct ... other messages\n\ntype IncomingMessage = CounterIncBy | CounterReset | ...;\n\n// ... after parsing a message\nmatch (msg) {\n    CounterIncBy => {\n        newCounter = curCounter + msg.byValue\n    }\n    CounterReset => {\n        newCounter = 0\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\n\nüå≥ So, union types (that perfectly work with tensors) will seamlessly work with structures. With union types, you will declare both Either and different kinds of messages. Combined with intN and other types, they will allow to express (almost) any practical TL/B construction. They are not limited to message routing ‚Äî in other words, message routing does not differ from handling any field, any storage, or any cell in general.",

      "text": "üéâ Tact v1.6.6 is released!\n\nThe final patch release of this v1.6 series is upon us, and it brings a significant tooling improvement, amongst other things. Meet the official Tact formatter ‚Äî a new tool that ensures consistent code style across your Tact projects. It ships with Tact v1.6.6, and you can run it in your projects via npx tact-fmt or by invoking a format command in your editor. You'd need to install the Tact's language server or the VSCode extension for that ‚Äî see the tact-language-server repo for details.\n\nThe v1.6.* series of patches has been a journey of refinement and polish, setting the stage for what's coming next. As we close this chapter, we're already working hard on exciting new features for the future.\n\nFor now, let's explore the Tact v1.6.6 release:\n\nüß∞ Standard library additions and changes\n\n‚Ä¢ Added compute phase exit code constants reserved by the Tact compiler, such as TactExitCodeNullReferenceException (128) and many others.\n\n‚Ä¢ Added the SignedBundle struct and the corresponding verifySignature method.\n\n‚Ä¢ Added sendRawMessage and sendRawMessageReturnForwardFee functions as replacements for their deprecated counterparts.\n\n‚Ä¢ Optimized the sha256() function to about ~270 less gas used per call and added the keccak256() function that works with arbitrarily long slices.\n\nüõ† Bug fixes\n\nThere were a lot of those. Remember that last time we started fuzzing the compiler with LLMs to root out bugs? Well, we found many bugs that way and fixed even more ‚Äî many error messages got way more informative and useful. Some bug fixes allowed for seemingly unrelated UX improvements too.\n\nOne nice example of a second-order fix would be that the require() function now supports constants as its second parameter. You no longer need to provide identical string literals everywhere ‚Äî define a string constant somewhere and reuse it!\n\nSee the full release notes for a long list of bugs squished and error messages improved.\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Documentation updates\n\n‚Ä¢ Added a \"Learn Tact in Y minutes\" page, which gives a whirlwind code-first tour of the Tact language.\n\n‚Ä¢ Any AI vibe coders out there? The docs now generate llms.txt, llms-full.txt and llms-small.txt files for you to use with your AIs. The small version is particularly interesting as it fits in the 200k context.\n\n‚Ä¢ The \"gas best practices\" page got updated with new recommendations, such as specialized math functions or the BasechainAddress struct and related functions.\n\n‚Ä¢ Lots of examples fixed, with more fixes to arrive as we speak.\n\nüß≥ Formatter!\n\nYou can run it via npx tact-fmt in your projects ‚Äî it supports checking the formatting via the --check flag, applying fixes via the --write flag, and can check both individual files and directories of files.\n\nFurthermore, it also ships with our official language server and VSCode extensions. See the tact-language-server's README.md for installation details.\n\nüìú See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.6\nüì• And upgrade Tact in your projects\n\nIn about 4 days from now, on April 21 at 12:00 (UTC+3), the Tact Smart Battle will begin! It is the ultimate smart contract challenge powered by Tact and organized by TON Studio & Codeforces. The prize pool is $20,000 in Toncoin, and the top 128 participants will receive exclusive Soulbound Tokens (SBTs). Moreover, the best battlers will be invited for job interviews at TON Studio.\n\nAnd all participants with valid solutions would also receive a Participant SBT.\n\nüëâ Register, if not already: Codeforces\n‚Ä¢ Here's the registration guide, just in case: Notion\n‚Ä¢ Hop in the community chat to ask questions, receive support and have fun learning and using Tact: @tact_smart_battle\n\nüç≤ flint and tact\n‚ô®Ô∏è @tact_kitchen from the @ton_studio"
