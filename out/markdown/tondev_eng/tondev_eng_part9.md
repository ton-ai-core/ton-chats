Zqy: "Does it mean that if I place an identical user agreement into countless cells, the fee is only calculated for one? Guys, how should I understand this? Looking at the formula ¬†storage_fee = (cells_count * cell_price + bits_count * bit_price) * time_delta / 2^16¬†, it seems that ¬†cells_count¬† is only used to calculate cells with different hashes. But I'm confused about ¬†bits_count¬†. If I use many identical cells, the total amount of data is still increasing, so do I still have to pay for the repeated data?"

Zqy: who can help me

Zqy: this is doc about fees-low-level. "I still cannot understand. If I create many identical cells with the same content, and their hashes are the same, the document states that identical cells are not counted multiple times.

Jason: Hey guys

Jason: how's it going

Sadegh: Sometimes it would be convenient if the gas fee for the transactions would be paid by some other account. In the EVM ecosystem there's EIP-2711 for that: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2711  Is there something like that on TON blockchain, or the fee must always be paid by the sender?

&rey: By the sender always. It is actually impossible to pay from any other account since it might be in another shard. (reply to 105104)

&rey: The most accurate wording would be "external message has been accepted, but transaction tree originating from it is not complete yet". Well, messages are in queue. TON structure guarantees they will be processed eventually. (reply to 105092)

Sadegh: So as I found, there is no way to transfer jettons from an account without having TON on it. (+not using w5)  Am I correct? (reply to 105106)

Sadegh: Sorry for to many questions, and what if the wallet be v5? I read that this functionality exist in this version but I couldn't found any sample code for it. is there any simple code for it?  I want user sign a jetton transfer transfer and send it to server and server pay the gas for it.

Laisky: Every message should be transfered with some TON within it to pay the forward fee.  The payer is not necessarily the owner of the jetton; whoever pays can initiate the call.  The greatest joy of TON programming is using your imagination to build a call chain. The first caller pays all the costs, ensuring that the remaining value is eventually returned to him. You can do anything you want in between. (reply to 105109)

Sadegh: I want to add options for example hamster users that they just connect their wallet (with just hamster on it) and then I handle all the things for them.  I want somehow create a service that pay the fee for them in the backend with no need to have ton on their wallets.  is this idea possible or not? (reply to 105111)

Sadegh: I'm new to TON, sorry for noob questions. so it's possible to create something like my idea yeah? (reply to 105111)

Laisky: users have Jetton users need to transfer their Jetton to others users do not have any TON coins you want to cover all the fees  Am I getting your requirements right? (reply to 105112)

Sadegh: exactly. (reply to 105115)

ABRAHAM: is there any issue with ton network? I cannot send ton transaction via tonkeeper extension or toncenter API? My wallet has over 100 TON and I just send 1 TON?

Laisky: IMHO, unless users have staked their Jetton in your account, they cannot transfer their own Jetton without paying TON coins.  Typically, only the owner is allowed to initiate a TokenTransfer (0xf8a7ea5) message for their own Jetton. (reply to 105116)

Sadegh: üòîüòî Thanks. But it possible in w5? (reply to 105119)

Sadegh: Thanks, I will take a look üôèüèª (reply to 105124)

ABRAHAM: at least you still have transaction in tonviewer, for me it disappeared (reply to 105125)

Laisky: Jetton and ERC-20 Tokens have a significant difference: ERC-20 Tokens are stored in a centralized contract, whereas Jettons are decentralized and stored in the user's own Jetton wallet. Therefore, transferring Jettons requires the user to call their own contract personally.  I'm not familiar with wallet v5, but I assume the underlying principle will not change. (reply to 105122)

Pandario: Hi! is it possible that a Tx from yesterday evening, incoming on my ton space, appears completed by Explorer but there is no confirmation in my wallet balance?

Anmse: ya thx, I get that this happens when shards are being restored, but we still don't know how long the wait will be. (reply to 105171)

Anmse: üéÉ

Pandario: I saw that there were block production issues a few hours ago, but if that was my case I don't understand why the TX is confirmed instead of pending or canceled

&rey: What do you mean "cancelled"? If external message to your wallet was recorded, it was the only possible outcome) (reply to 105179)

Pandario: sorry, I used the wrong word. I meant that if there were block production issues when the TX was sent to me, its status should now be pending? (reply to 105181)

Pandario: why is it confirmed but the address balance has not changed?

Joe: Hi, Recently we are monitoring the local validator nodes of the test network. I have some questions to ask. Thank you very much! 1. The query in the link above is for the main network validator. Is there an API for the test network?  https://elections.toncenter.com/docs  https://toncenter.com/api/qos/index.html#/ 2. Can the local validator node build the API in the document ? So that the service is more stable. 3. Does the local validator node have an API to query local node data and performance? I didn‚Äôt see it in the official API document. https://toncenter.com/

Bruno: hey please help, my wallet cannot sent or receive tx. When sending a transaction it will appear pending but then get 404 on tonviewer

Pandario: and it's the first time something like this has happened to me (reply to 105175)

Cloud: Hello, my local ton node cannot catch up with the latest height of the blockchain after using snapshot reset, and it is always behind by almost the same number of blocks. I tried to reset it many times, but it didn't work. However, my other ton node was not reset, and the configuration, resources, version, etc. were consistent with the problematic ton node. How can I recover the problematic node? I hope to get help from the project.

Defier: Is there a link that lists all the validators we can stake on?

Defier: is there a different channel I should be asking?  I don't see a validator/node operator channel so hoping someone in Dev chat knows about validators.  thanks

Deniel: Could you help me understand how to retrieve the initialization data of a smart contract on the client side (React)? I have an application with a button.

I want the client-side application to display the address of the newly deployed "Child" contract. Here's the relevant part of the "Parent"  contract code in tact:  receive(msg: NewBanka) {         self.bankaCount = self.bankaCount + 1;         let init: StateInit = initOf Banka(self.bankaCount);         let ctx: Context = context();         let sender = ctx.sender;         send(SendParameters{             to: contractAddress(init),             value: ton("0.1"),             mode: SendIgnoreErrors,             code: init.code,             data: init.data,             body: InternalAddBanka{goalName: msg.goalName, goalAmount: msg.goalAmount, bankaOwnerAddress: sender}.toCell(),         }); }

I have a doubt, I have cloned the token-contract repository from https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract, and i see that there is a op-codes.fc contract which contains identifiers for the functions defined in jetton-minter.fc and jetton-wallet.fc, i would like to know if the value of the identifiers in the op-codes.fc file are generated or are random hex numbers defined by the developer. Also i would like to know which contract do i have to compile to create a jetton token, it is enough compiling jetton-minter.fc?? or i have to compile jetton-minter,wallet, op-codes and then upload it?

Chad: How to create nested map?    stakes: map<Address, map<Address, Stake>>;

Zqy: What do they mean about I HR and HRÔºåhere.I I read docs but i can't Understand them. I want to help

Anton: put the nested map into a struct (reply to 105848)

Zqy: I noticed in the document that it mentions ¬†inline-ref¬†, which is used for calling, and it is stated that the gas consumption for hash search and dictionary calls is much lower. So why can't we always use this method for frequent calls? It doesn't have the disadvantage of ¬†inline¬† which can cause code bloat, it just references, and the gas is low. Are there also many advantages in frequent calls? Compared to dictionaries.

Zqy: pleaseÔºåI have  these two questions

Wick: I was learning TACT but some good dev told me that it is better to start from FunC. so from where do I learn it?

Wick: I find course which are from the TON devs a bit complex to understand

Zqy: "Thank you for your reply, does 'IHR' refer to the additional costs required for complex algorithms when there are more than 16 shards?" (reply to 105865)

&rey: I in IHR stands for "instant": message which gets delivered in destination shard instantly, being discarded from normal routing at the same time. This mechanism, if enabled, is supposed to cost additional TON in forward fee. (reply to 105869)

Will a transaction built on these steps give a result identical to the purchase of NFT by the user through the getgems website page? Steps: 1) Receiving information about nft-items of our collection via the "get_sale_data" method of the "nft_sale_getgems_v3" contract. 2) Creating a transaction for the user to transfer to the address of the contract "nft_sale_getgems_v3" an amount equal to "full_price" + network commission (~0.3 TON)  That is: USER ‚Äî[GET_SALE_DATA_RESULT.full_price + 0.3 TON]‚Äî> [nft_sale_getgems_v3 ADDRESS]  We judge by the documentation from here:

Sunny: ANYBODY PLEASE HELPPPPPP????  how can i get jetton address from user wallet address?????   I am using jettonDeployController   transaction and all is working but not able to get the jetton address of specific wallet

C√©sar: How can verify if the transaction was confirmes? Looks status not is correct.

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: And here is this question again :)  FYI: the response of operation "send" does not guarantee that it have already been "executed". When you "send" email - there is no information about it delivery. It may be delivered (tomorrow) return or may return to you (invalid address, etc). You will know "result" later. So, you need some other "operation" to check result of your first action.  Same in TON - you should check (again and again) for signs that you operation executed - for example outbound tx at your wallet, or recieve tx in destination wallet - it depends of what you think "success" is in every situation (reply to 106097)

C√©sar: I mean when is confirmed by the user, not in the blockchain. (reply to 106100)

C√©sar: When user click the confirm button.

C√©sar: This way works in others chains sorry for ask. There is not in the docs what data result return?

M3hd_.: hello guys anyone know the pass-word?

M3hd_.: GM event password i mean

MRT: You should first detect whether the destination contract is a wallet contract. If it is, your transaction is a simple transfer. However, in the w5 version, we have extensions, and an internal transaction can contain anything. If it's not a wallet contract, you must deserialize the transaction, decode the body of each message, and check the opcodes. If the body contains a command, binary command, or encrypted message, it's still a simple transfer but with some additional message data. Otherwise, it may involve a contract operation. (reply to 106231)

Gijs: Can somebody tell my why after broadcasting a native TON transfer. It never gets propagated to the network? At this point it feels like a coin flip whether after submitting it will have been sent or not. (Using @ton/ton JS sdk and I‚Äôm polling for txid after submitting)

&rey: Well, there is no guarantee that any given external message will be included, so indeed some get lost. (reply to 106243)

Gijs: So what would be the timespan after it can be guaranteed to never be included? Are there maybe docs on the specific reason they never get inlcuded? (reply to 106245)

&rey: If wallet ext-message structure supports deadline, then once message won't be included after block with that deadline is generated. (reply to 106246)

Andrii Ivaniv: How to check if some jetton has non-standard logic?  For example there is TEN jetton that have implemented jetton_master standard (tonviewer) and also jetton_wallet standart (tonviewer). But this token has some additional logic - it sets 10% tax for buy and sell.

Laisky: IMHO, There are only standard interfaces, but no standard implementation. (reply to 106472)

Andrii Ivaniv: So, there is no possible to check if jetton is honeypot for example? (reply to 106481)

Laisky: If the source code of the contract is available, it can be easily checked. (reply to 106483)

Laisky: answer by AI withing whitepapers:  1. Logical Time: The most likely factor is the logical creation time of the messages. Since messages from the same contract have strictly increasing logical creation times, this naturally establishes an order even for messages seemingly arriving simultaneously. 2. Message Hash: In case of a tie in logical time (extremely unlikely for internal messages within the same block), the message with the smaller hash could be prioritized, as seen in the monotonicity condition (2.2.5) for importing messages from neighboring shardchains. 3. Order of Arrival in OutMsgQueue: While not explicitly mentioned, it's conceivable that the order in which messages were added to the OutMsgQueue of their respective source shardchains could influence their processing order. This would imply maintaining some ordering within the OutMsgQueue, possibly based on arrival time or some other factor. 4. Validator Discretion: The document might leave some aspects of message ordering within a block to the validator's discretion, allowing for flexibility and potential optimizations. However, any such discretion must still adhere to the overall consistency conditions and guarantees of the blockchain. (reply to 106471)

Assigned|| Dropsüíß: If The Devs or any Member of $Major Team can see this.  A payment of 1000 stars is requested to get a daily rating of 50,000 Major Points.  I subscribed to that since August 28 2024 but couldn‚Äôt claim as promised and tried to reach the Team to no avail.  So my question is, is it supposed to be 1000 stars payment daily for 50,000 MP or a one time payment of 1000 stars for 50,000 daily?  That line of information seems a little unclear and I would suggest clarity for me and other users who participate diligently.  I have screenshots.

User<7483137682>: if you are using the @tonconnect/ui-react package, you dont need to install the @tonconnect/sdk. The @tonconnect/ui-react package already wraps the functionality of @tonconnect/sdk, so you can manage your wallet connection entirely through the UI package. (reply to 107456)

Wick: btw appreciated you took out some seconds, mate

Niu: Incorrect Error Message Displayed When Sending USDT with Insufficient Balance via @wallet Bot (TON Space)  Description: While using the @wallet Telegram bot on TON Space to send USDT, I encountered an issue where the error message displayed is not accurate. When my USDT balance is insufficient to complete the transaction, instead of showing "Insufficient USDT balance," the bot displays "Unverified transaction." This is misleading, as the actual problem is the lack of sufficient USDT, not an unverified transaction.  Interestingly, when sending TON with an insufficient balance, the error message is correct, clearly indicating that the TON balance is insufficient. However, the error message for USDT is not handled correctly in the same situation, which leads me to believe this could be a bug specific to USDT transactions in TON Space.  Steps to Reproduce: - Attempt to send USDT via @wallet Telegram bot on TON Space with a balance lower than the amount you are trying to send. - The bot returns the message "Unverified transaction" instead of indicating that the USDT balance is insufficient.  Expected Behavior: The bot should display a clear message such as "Insufficient USDT balance" when the user‚Äôs USDT balance is not enough to cover the transaction.  Additional Information: - The network fees (TON) are sufficient. - The issue is specific to USDT balance insufficiency. - Error handling works correctly when sending TON with insufficient balance, but not with USDT.  Could you please investigate this and address the inconsistent error messaging for USDT transactions?

Niu: @tsivarev @andreypfau

Eren: Hi all, I have been running into a particular roadblock when I try to test/deploy my smart contract to the testnet.   It always returns   Error: Unable to execute get method. Got exit_code: 11  I have tried using the approach on Stepik and Blueprint.   I think the major issue emanates  from using the get provider.   async getCurrentNValue(provider: ContractProvider): Promise<number> {         const result = await provider.get('get_current_n_value()', []);         return result.stack.readNumber();     }    How do I resolve this? It‚Äôs been a major roadblock for me. Thanks.

Tom: Guys, why are my excess transactions always fail?

Tom: Last internal tx

Haint: the excess message needs to have no body (reply to 107813)

Haint: if it has a body payload (in_msg_body is not empty) then it will proceed to check for the opcode

Haint:     if (in_msg_body.slice_empty?()) { ;; ignore all empty messages         return ();     }

Tom: Interesting, I'm using Jetton contract and I think this is the part it returns exceeded fund.  if ((response_address.preload_uint(2) != 0) & (msg_value > 0)) {     var msg = begin_cell()       .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; nobounce - int_msg_info$0 ihr_disabled:Bool bounce:Bool bounced:Bool src:MsgAddress -> 010000       .store_slice(response_address)       .store_coins(msg_value)       .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)       .store_uint(op::excesses(), 32)       .store_uint(query_id, 64);     send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), 2);   }

Haint: if this is the excesses message then it is a valid one. Problem might be in the destination contract

Haint: 65535 means the opcode is unknown in the destination contract

Tom: The destination contract is the jetton-minter-discoverable.fc It comes from here: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-minter-discoverable.fc

Alan | Torch: Hey all, is it possible to store TVM tuples into storage directly? It will be great since our team is trying to optimize gas on matrix multiplication, and store the output matrix directly

ÊàëË¶ÅÈ£û: Could you please help me check what the issue is? My server has 16 cores, 64GB of memory, and 2TB of disk space. I am running a full node on the server, and I have started the LiteServer. Then I converted it to an HTTP RPC node through ton-http-api. This node only processes a small amount of data from my calls. It should normally retrieve data as if accessing it locally. I am also accessing it directly from the server using 127.0.0.1:8080, but I have encountered a strange phenomenon. For the simplest operation, such as fetching wallet assets, the response time is over 3 seconds, and the intervals are inconsistent. Sometimes it even takes up to 10 seconds, which is much slower than public nodes. Can you help me identify where the problem might be? Thank you!

Abdulaziz: I don't fully understand how that Blockchain works, what's the transaction tree, nft ownership assign and etc (reply to 108085)

&rey: Each transaction only changes state of one contract, and incoming+outcoming message queues.  Normal transactions are always handling of a single incoming message, either from outside of blockchain or from a contract. (reply to 108087)

Abdulaziz: You can call this thing message? (reply to 108089)

&rey: Yes, approximately. An internal message goes between smart contracts, carrying some TON, body(payload/comment), and some other things. (reply to 108090)

Abdulaziz: is there another types of messages which we can't see? I'm not talking about encrypted messages (reply to 108091)

Abdulaziz: No (reply to 108341)

Abdulaziz: It's just for testing, for example you wanna mint nft, but on mainnet, you should pay (reply to 108341)

&rey: Root hash = representation hash of block root cell. File hash = hash of block BOC.  Seqno indeed should identify block in shardchain uniquely, but network might have signed invalid block which needs replacement at the same seqno. (reply to 108337)

–û–ª—è: Hello üëã  I came across a problem: I'm using global variables to load the contract state. Local tests all pass, everything deploys, data is correct.

When trying to call methods of the contract code unknown_op. As soon as I remove global variables - everything works. Simplified code below  Using global variables: global int ctx_data;  () load_data() impure inline {     slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();      ctx_data = ds~load_uint(16);          ds.end_parse();          }  () save_data() impure inline {     set_data(         begin_cell()             .store_uint(ctx_data, 16)         .end_cell()     ); }  Without global variables:  (int) load_data() impure inline {     slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();        return ds~load_uint(16);     }  () save_data(data) impure inline {     set_data(         begin_cell()             .store_uint(data, 16)         .end_cell()     ); } I've seen this practice in many contracts, this is the first time I've tried it myself, anyone have any ideas why this behavior?

pfeffunit: Hello! I‚Äôm deploying a contract to store some user data, for each, from my main contract. I need to put some of the user paid fees into the cost of deployment. The deployment occurs after the user pays into the main contract.   What‚Äôs the right way to determine that amount? I don‚Äôt want to hard code it, that seems brittle.   Is there a solid way to calculate it on the fly? What‚Äôs best practice?  Thanks !

‚Äî 2024-09-26 ‚Äî

Haint: even jetton hardcodes the gas required... best practice is to avoid setting that amount higher than necessary, through iterative unit testing. (reply to 109072)

pfeffunit: thanks! gas usage or costs don't fluctuate as much as ethereum? in solidity/EVM that would be crazy to hard code it, since the gas required for a single operation can vary so much (reply to 109151)

Haint: currently it doesn't change much, but it's possible in the future if more people start using the network. you can always monitor and upgrade the code though. the architecture is vastly different from evm so it's not trivial to make gas estimation before submitting the message (reply to 109152)

pfeffunit: interesting, thanks so much

David: Is there a way to destroy some of my jetton accounts to get back the Ton in their balance?

Small: What is the difference between load_int and load_uint, considering that ton only has the type int

pfeffunit: i have a withdraw() function, to pull out the money from customers, but need to leave some amount behind

Haint: moreover evm has a concept of gas which is separated from the native tokens (ETH), so even if the gas price changes, the gas amount stays the same. ton doesn't have this afaik

David: Do you want to share the code? (reply to 109159)

pfeffunit: Sure!  Here's the withdraw code:      } elseif (op == op::withdraw_all) {         throw_unless(error::not_authorized, equal_slices(sender_address, owner_address));          ;; TODO: think i need to set this up         ;; raw_reserve(MIN_STORAGE_FEE, RESERVE_UP_TO);          ;; Create the outgoing message         ;; https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/cookbook#how-to-send-a-message-with-the-entire-balance         cell msg = begin_cell()             .store_uint(0x18, 6) ;; flags             .store_slice(owner_address) ;; destination address             .store_coins(0) ;; we don't care about this value right now             .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1) ;; default message headers (see sending messages page)             .store_uint(0, 32) ;; zero opcode - means simple transfer message with comment             .end_cell();         send_raw_message(msg, 128); ;; mode = 128 is used for messages that are to carry all the remaining balance of the current smart contract (reply to 109162)

pfeffunit: from what i gather, if i call raw_reserve before the fund transfer, mode 128 will leave that amount in the contract

Haint: you can destroy a contract using mode 160 on send_raw_message. Unfortunately, jetton wallet doesn't provide this function, so you can't get the TON back (reply to 109157)

David: got it , but for the existing common Jetton, there is no such method, so there is nothing we can do, right? (reply to 109163)

pfeffunit: raw_reserve is  in stdlib? (reply to 109166)

james.bertol.leonidas$‚Ç¨: Yes

pfeffunit: so not sure what you mean there's nothing we can do

Haint: you can do it with contracts you have control of the code, you don't for jetton wallet (reply to 109170)

pfeffunit: oh yes this is a contract i'm writing

pfeffunit: it just proceses TON payments

David: I think we should promote this as a best practice to add these withdrawal functions into Jetton wallet when developing, otherwise there will be too much dead Ton sitting in those contracts (reply to 109173)

pfeffunit: I also create contracts to track some user data, so i guess i need to forward some amount of TON into those. currently i was not, i was just doing it like this:          var msg = begin_cell()         .store_uint(BOUNCEABLE, 6)         .store_slice(payment_tracker_address)         .store_coins(payment_tracker_deployment_fee)         .store_uint(4 + 2 + 1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1)         .store_ref(state_init)         .store_ref(deposit_body);          ;; Send the message         send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), 0); ;; Change to mode 1 to keep the remaining balance

pfeffunit: i made payment_tracker_deployment_fee configurable so i could adjust that "gas" fee

pfeffunit: is that amount going to be used to pay the fee to create the contract AND sent into the contract to pay storage fees?

pfeffunit: (thanks so much everyone, so helpful so far!)

Small: What is the difference between load_int and load_uint, considering that ton only has the type int,and if there a security problem if i identify a int 'a' but use 'a=s.load_uint'

Small: and if i send multi times raw_reserve,what will happen?

Small: and for this link code,why it do not have params type?https://github.com/ton-blockchain/bridge-func/blob/e2b93105bda04642814d424a7094715194fa7721/func/message_utils.fc#L15-L24

JuunS | Part of Manexus | Web3 Dev: any example for getting balance and sending jetton? (reply to 109247)

Token: sorry, I did it a few months ago and until then, I couldn't find any source (reply to 109263)

Tom: I understand that is possible with highload wallet and script. But the thing is, we have no control over the connected wallet. They come from TonConnect and could be V3, V4 or V5. So we cannot force them to use highload wallet. (reply to 109261)

Token: then send message to deployed contract (reply to 109266)

Tom: Is this contract open source? Or where can I find documentation for this? Thanks a lot. (reply to 109268)

Token: lol, the contract is I deployed. (reply to 109270)

Tom: Afaik, that contract acts as a deployer? Receiving Jetton from sender and distribute them?

Mohammad: Hey everyone, I was trying to write a contract that checks whether an NFT sent to it, is from a specific collection or not. But we cannot prove that the NFT is coming from a specific collection because get_static_data can be faked and there is no other option in TEP-62. That would be nice if there was a flow that we could use to make sure the NFT transferred to our smart contract is an NFT from a specific collection. if get_static_data could ask from collection to provide these information the problem would be solved.  Is there any workaround to make sure an NFT is coming from a specific collection? Would  it be ok to store a dictionary of all NFT addresses in the collection and check them in nft_ownership_assigned operation?

&rey: 1. You can hash cell that comes from TON Connect; it is hash of the external message (not of transaction!). 2. Probably you can feed that hash into explorers; if it points to a message, it is indeed recorded in blockchain, and the money is sent.

Endgame: hi there, does anyone know why using testnet toncenter api (https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/getTransactions?address) the wallet address will return address prefix of EQ instead of 0Q? is that a bug?

Lich King: hey, why transfers need to have a transfer notification in order to be considered valid? ""Ensure that the message body is not empty and that the first 32 bits of the message match the transfer notification op code 0x7362d09c. Tonweb example If the message body is empty or the op code is invalid - skip the transaction.". If you send a tx with no tx notification, why would that be invalid? in ton examples for sending withdrawals you sent it without tx notification

üéê*<@Maxim: Because Bounce message without op code.. we have to skip it (reply to 109341)

Filip: Anyone using Ton node validator in Lite-Server mode in Hetzner?

Lich King: ok but why in the docs the jetton withdrawal example here https://github.com/toncenter/examples/blob/main/withdrawals-jettons.js#L188 is actually a transfer without transfer notification? I checked the wallet that was sent the jetton amount and it was credited there, why didn't they send the amount with "forwareded_ton_amount" which triggers a tx notification? (reply to 109348)

Filip: Bug bounty program still active? I found a bug in mytonctrl

üéê*<@Maxim: Perhaps these addresses are equal: to-sender and to-forward ? (reply to 109350)

&rey: Transfer notification is generated by destination's jetton wallet. (reply to 109350)

Nhat Nguyen: I have issue: when create transferJetttons how to check transaction Failed  or Success?

Champer Wu: You just need to assemble the boc for sending internal message to your Jetton wallet then the transfer would be implemented as following this way to assemble your message https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter-contract/blob/074b7d5f45f43552146fdf54f972020b2757bc18/test/lib/jetton-wallet.ts#L9 (reply to 109660)

User<7466683040>: hi

.: Thank you. What about ton space(telegram wallet) (reply to 109665)

Lich King: Hey guys, if you build a cex for example, is it actually necessary when you send a jetton withdrawal to also send a forward ton amount to notify the main wallet of user? The user will still end up with the coins in his wallet so not sending forward ton amount would decrease the overall withdrawal costs, right?

Champer Wu: what‚Äôs the topic you are asking? ton space is an interface for interacting with wallet contract , it the same application such as tonkeeper, mytonwallet, and openmask (reply to 109682)

PtcBink: There is no way to send USDT without contract. (reply to 109660)

final: Does anyone have mining Jetton contract?

Degen: Why does the nft collection fail to send messages to the nft item in part during batch mint?

Degen: But next_item_index is already used

Dmitriy: It‚Äôs recommended to always attach at least 1 nanoTON as forward_ton_amount to make transfer_notification message appear in the blockchain, so wallets/explorers can see it (reply to 109687)

Mohammad: Hey guys Can someone please explain what does this line mean?  int right_shard? = sender_address.slice_check_prefix(my_address().preload_bits(2 + 1 + 8 + 4)); ;; constructor + anycast + workchain + part of hash  and why should someone check the request came from the same shard?

Omid: Thief beware

NPA120: Is it possible to call the smart contract write function via Ton explorer like tonviewer?

&rey: No. There are no "calls" or "write functions". (reply to 109756)

&rey: Contracts process messages, mainly internal; to send one, you need to pay from a wallet. (Actually, all TON transfers are internal messages.)

Abdulaziz: $extMsg = $wallet->createTransferMessage(     [         New Transfer(             dest: new Address("EQCrrSblmeNMAw27AXbchzG6MUja9iac7PHjyK3Xn8EMeqbG")             amount: Units::toNano("0.012"),             payload: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",             sendMode: \Olifanton\Ton\SendMode::PAY_GAS_SEPARATELY,         ),     ]  Why it didn't worked

Abdulaziz: It doesn't accept urls as message or what? (reply to 109767)

Kings: Hello. Does anyone use python in using tonsdk?

&rey: @npa120 To do so, you need to reconsider architecture.

NPA120: Signature is a solution? (reply to 109772)

&rey: Almost. (reply to 109775)

&rey: I think I'll run a lecture on that during Hack-TON-berfest instead of trying to explain over and over.

NPA120: In tx data, anybody can see smart contract function name?

&rey: In tx data, anybody can see raw bits+refs of payload; anybody can also see data+code of contract; those can be matched to somewhat interpret the message. (reply to 109780)

The Max: Hello everyone! Could you advise how to implement a jetton claim for users?  As I understand, the current system works similarly to SBT NFTs. The backend checks if the user is eligible for minting, the user sends a transaction with extra gas, the admin wallet mints the SBT NFT and sends it to the user.  What alternatives are available at the moment? Mintless jetton is not working, because token already exist.

isik: How can I distinguish between jetton transfer and dex swaps, they both have the opcode 0x0f8a7ea5.

&rey: They are pretty much identical from blockchain perspective (because swaps == transfers). Well, you can look at forward payload and check if it contains some order for making a swap. (reply to 110210)

Zeynab: Hey @pcrafter, I am trying to use HashEXT_SHA256 to hash large amounts of bits. I want it to have a result exactly as sha256 in Solidity, but in solidity my input data is in bytes, whereas in FunC the asm function receives slices as input. Is there a way I can give ints to this function? Besides that, I need to hash the result of the previous hash, so I think I necessarily need to have a way to hash integers.  Thank you in advance

&rey: begin_cell().store_uint(x, 256) (the asm function may receive builders as input as well)

Token: what do you mean? ofc possible (reply to 110770)

TKAINU: I want to build a deposit, withdraw jetton token system, and have a problem in the withdraw step. When calling withdraw, it will burn token A of the current contract, and return token B to the user, but I don't know if burning token A is possible. Is it successful or not? Is there any way to ensure that token A is burned successfully before returning token B to the user? Thank you very much. (reply to 110771)

&rey: Are tokens A or tokens B controllable by you, or they already exist? More precisely: which codes can you modify? (reply to 110773)

TKAINU: I can modify code A, and the withdraw function is in contract A (reply to 110774)

&rey: Then you don't need a withdraw function. Just create appropriate handler in jetton A's master, working at any burn notification.

Rayan: @pcrafter  can you help me? (reply to 111612)

Rayan: Aha thanks. So batch part is done from wallet contract to jetton wallet and then each branch does only one token transfer. (reply to 111614)

&rey: Yes. Writing custom jw would require measurement on message vs dictionary fees. (reply to 111615)

&rey: Though, if jetton is to have tax, batch-order on jw would most likely be cheaper.

Alexander: I need to verify that a hash is correctly created. I have an object that has been hash outside of TON. I have the associated proof on-chain. I now want to submit the object on-chain in a permissionless manner. To do this, I need to hash the object to compare against the proven object. The object vary between 200 and 500 Bytes (4000 bits).  However, I cannot stored all of this in a cell without references. According to the docs, this implies I cannot sha256 hash it. It this true?  I have tried various other paths, like trying to convert the information to strings (since strings seems to have less strict size requirements), however this doesn't seem possible either.  How do I get the hash of the object? Specifically a raw sha256 hash, not a chained sha256 hash.

Champer Wu: why not reference? And I just saying, you don‚Äôt need to hash all object, all you need is verifying the object is authenticated Perhaps just need to verify the some key field? (reply to 111672)

Alexander: In case data is a String it should have a number of bits divisible by 8, and in case it‚Äôs a Slice it must also have no references (i.e. only up to 1023 bits of data in total).

darshan: Withdraw my toncoin in tonblock chains

darshan: How do this method

Alexander: I am comparing the content of a message to the root verified by a light client. (reply to 111674)

darshan: Tell us

darshan: Which method

Alexander: The leaf is the hash of the message and as such, I need to recompute the leaf (hash the message). I can't just hash a partial object since this wouldn't prove anything about the validity of the message.

darshan: Which coding are executed

Champer Wu: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/message-builders#transfer-with-a-comment #simple_transfer (reply to 111687)

Champer Wu: Could you tell me what's your purpose? maybe the way to approach the goal was not only an option (reply to 111686)

Alexander: I want to execute a swap between 2 chains: Ton and another chain. The other chain has a light client that I have already ported to Tact. The light client allows me to trustlessly verify every single transaction and event that happened on that chain.  The block header is the part that is verified. And that part is easy since the block header is less than 120 bytes. The block header contains a merkle root (which I again can easily compute).  However, each leaf of the merkle tree is the hash of the transaction & events. Those are between 200 and 500 bytes. I want to make an inclusion proof of an event (For example, you pay me) so that I can release the tokens for you on Ton.  To get a leaf I need to hash the 200 to 500 bytes. (reply to 111689)

Alexander: The thing is, regardless of how you twist and turn this problem you cannot hash less than the entirety because that "less than entirety" never happened.

ùó† ùó†: Hello, looking for an experienced developer on TON Pay is great)

Champer Wu: I see you want to build a cross bridge for swaping the token between two different chain. it‚Äôs totally a huge project. how about zk tech for compressing your data? (reply to 111691)

Alexander: It doesn't compress the actual transaction object though, only the proof. (reply to 111695)

I will be very grateful if someone can help üôè  There is a smart contract on the clock for accepting payments:  ------------  import "@stdlib/deploy";  message Payment {     orderId: Int as uint32; }  message PaymentReceived {     orderId: Int as uint32;     amount: Int as coins;     sender: Address; }  contract PaymentReceiver with Deployable {     owner: Address;          init(owner: Address) {         self.owner = owner;     }      receive(msg: Payment) {         let ctx: Context = context();                  // Check that the transfer amount is greater than 0         require(ctx.value > 0, "Payment amount must be greater than 0");                  // We will issue an event about the received payment         emit(PaymentReceived{             orderId: msg.orderId,             amount: ctx.value,             sender: ctx.sender         }.toCell());          // We send funds to the owner of the contract         send(SendParameters{             to: self.owner,             value: ctx.value - ton("0.1"), // We leave a little for the commission             mode: SendIgnoreErrors,             bounce: false         });     }      // Handler for the "withdraw" text message, allowing the owner to withdraw funds     receive("withdraw") {         let ctx: Context = context();         require(ctx.sender == self.owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");                  send(SendParameters{             to: self.owner,             value: myBalance() - ton("0.1"), // We leave a little for the commission             mode: SendIgnoreErrors,             bounce: false         });     }      get fun owner(): Address {         return self.owner;     } }  ------------  at the front, I am forming a transaction and trying to form the correct body for the payload  ------------  import type { SendTransactionRequest, SendTransactionResponse } from '@tonconnect/sdk' import { TonConnectButton, useTonAddress, useTonWallet, useTonConnectUI } from '@townsquarelabs/ui-vue' import { beginCell, Address, toNano } from "@ton/core"; import { storePayment, Payment } from ' ./tact_PaymentReceiver'; // Importing the necessary functions from the generated file  ...  const { order_id, amount, payment_address } = paymentInfo.value  const payment: Payment = {   $$type: 'Payment',   orderId: BigInt(order_id) };  const testAmount = 0.05 //test amount  const body = beginCell()     .store(storePayment(payment))     .endCell();   // Forming a const transaction = {   validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 600, // Transaction duration (10 minutes)   messages: [ { address: payment_address, // Contract address       amount: toNano(testAmount.toString()).toString(), // Payment amount       stateInit: undefined,       payload: body.toBoc().toString('base64'),     }   ] };  paymentStatus.value = 'sending' const result: SendTransactionResponse = await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(transaction)  ------------  as soon as I didn't try to generate a correct payload, an error occurs every time 'it is not possible to verify the transaction'  But if you comment out the payload: body.toBoc().toString('base64') line, then the transaction is created and confirmed in the wallet successfully

Long: how do we stop when the error occurs? (reply to 111610)

M: https://t.me/notpixel/app?startapp=f6489798318_s628637

Haint: you cant (reply to 111892)

Haint: messages will only be sent in action phase

Kirills: Hi,  I'm new to using ston.fi and TON. I've implemented the swap functionality in our system, but I'm having trouble accurately calculating the amount spent and the amount received from an executed swap. I understand there are factors like gas fees, ston.fi commissions, and possibly other expenses. Can you provide guidance on how to obtain the correct amount spent and received?  Thank you.

Haint: stonfi should have an sdk that provides those functionalities (reply to 111899)

üê§ adil: I need ton testnet faucet help me please

TKAINU: I want to save a list of moderator addresses, but a cell can only store a maximum of 3 addresses. If I save a cell within a cell, it's too complicated. Is there any way to improve it?

Ankit j: Anyone looking for source code of app like Dogs tg app.. if you want please contact me..

Haint: store those in a dict then but seriously if that is too complicated then you'll be having a hard time (reply to 111912)

Long: Hi guys, how from a tx_hash from A -> B we can get the tx_hash of B-> C

Long: I see tonviewer can get this but not sure which api to look

Luke: can you give me the A -> B tx hash? I think I might have got something (reply to 111920)

TKAINU: u can show error code? (reply to 111918)

Yury: Hi everyone, does anyone have an example of sending Jetton? I use JS/TS

&rey: Docs have. https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#how-to-construct-a-message-for-a-jetton-transfer-with-a-comment. (reply to 111924)

Yury: üôèüèª I will try (reply to 111928)

Liam: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons#retrieving-data-for-a-specific-jetton-wallet   const expectedJettonWalletAddress = await jettonMinter.getJettonWalletAddress(data.ownerAddress.toString(false));   In the above code portion   ‚ÄúError: writeInt: value is NaN‚Äù  error, is there a workaround? I had the same question in a GitHub issue.

&rey: Doesn't getJettonWalletAddress(data.ownerAddress) work? (reply to 111932)

Madre: Sorry to raise the question, but does anyone know? If the problem is in the derivation path, how can I scan the wallet to see the coins in other addresses? (reply to 111848)

Liam: Oh it works, thank you üëç (reply to 111933)

Liam: @pcrafter   Can I ask you one more question?  I want to get the JettonWallet Address with only the Jetton Master Address and Toncoin address, is there any way to do it?

&rey: Please look in TON Cookbook; there is a section about it. (reply to 111940)

Liam: TON cookbook ! Thank you üëç (reply to 111941)

Jessica: Thank you, admin. Sometimes, even asking a question here seems to offend people.

Jessica: Can I ask the admins something? If everything is forbidden, even finding a collaborator to work on a project together, how will the community unite for new projects? Can someone please answer me? I already sent a message asking this, and it was deleted.

&rey: The point of this chat is not to build any community; rather, to help developers know how TON works. Appropriate channel for searching team is @tonhunt. (reply to 111947)

&rey: Or one of TON Society chats, IIRC.

Mehmet Ali: Hi All! We are trying to implement a taxing function for our jetton. Excluding the owner transfers; all jetton transfer would be taxed a %8 of the amount total which is like if addressA sends 100 jetton to addressB then 92 will arrive at destination and 8 will be deducted and transfered to the owner address.

Mehmet Ali: We have successfully deployed standard jettons from mpx-blueprint.

Mehmet Ali: but can't manage to do this taxing function for all transfers except the owner. Anyone have idea?

Mehmet Ali: We have the code structre testing but can't deploy.

Tom: Hey guys, do you know how to get this kind of config for @ton/sandbox? https://testnet.tonviewer.com/config  I'm trying to look into some config and sandbox won't expose them. I do see a config as cell but wonder what's the right way to parse. https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox/blob/fe0fc3b09adc0921d047543e5a7a3b1436d1c819/src/config/defaultConfig.ts

K: I'm calling swap contract A to swap Jetton -> TON. What's the best way to redirect 1% of received TON to another wallet (like fee)? Can I do it in the same txn by adding second message? Like how can I calculate 1% of final received TON amount if slippage was high? Or should I make some wrapper contract B for such logic?

&rey: your swap message will anyways be processed in next transaction, so you need to clarify (reply to 111958)

&rey: Please check out https://tonviewer.com/EQBTr1VlDmXjwt17E74xEo3KYeBEDp1p9xbixjk7eva_OcyH?section=code. (reply to 111951)

Mehmet Ali: I think this is funC, we are working in tact not sure how to undertstand and change it to tact. (reply to 111960)

Tom: Please help, thanks a lot (reply to 111956)

Jessica: I understand, but this is just a channel, not a community. I miss the early days of the internet when it was free and open, like BTC. I get your side of things, and I apologize. (reply to 111948)

Jessica: ok

Yury: I tried this method, but for some reason I only send Ton, not Jetton (reply to 111928)

&rey: Do you really need x1.5 factor in computation fees? (reply to 111962)

final: tact is more expensive than func? (reply to 111973)

User<6711570555>: Hey guys, is there anyone here who understands TON very well? I'm willing to pay for help and answers to questions

final: damn, didnt know it. it is real "educational fees for devs" üòÅ

Mehmet Ali: Actually do not care about fees at the moment... (reply to 111973)

Jessica: Hi, most of them won't respond. Share your question or what you need, and if possible, I'll help you. (reply to 111978)

Yury: who can help with my func? I create a body but it sends TON, not Jetton

Andrei_ka: sorry for disturbing, i have the same question as @YuryElizarov, in the provided documentation they show only how to create a message but how to send it then? i tried with '@ton/ton' `sendTransfer' function but it doesn't work, maybe someone knows which class/method should be used? (reply to 111928)

Yury: last trxs in wallet https://testnet.tonviewer.com/0QAfi4vtFZsNMYQK87UxHGncK5QkXXuadvEph78YynhcxS1S

Jessica: What do you really want with this? What is the purpose? Do you want to receive the wallet address? (reply to 111985)

Yury: I want send Jetton from my wallet to another wallet using JS (reply to 111990)

Heydar: we can create unlimited rps library from scratch that retrieve data like toncenter? I mean toncenter is just fetching data from unlimited TON blockchain transactions(maybe by protobuf ...) and make an easy way to use , so we can do the same way?! and prevent paying more money?

&rey: Have you directed message with transfer order at your jetton wallet? (reply to 111972)

Yury: Yes, I wanted to send jetton between my test wallets (reply to 111996)

&rey: You have, in fact, directed message at a destination wallet. This is fundamentally wrong. (reply to 111987)

Yury: I create transfer like this where did i go wrong?

Heydar: guys who know guide me please? I need more rps and no payments , is that possible? (reply to 111993)

&rey: Hm, should've went well. Check that you 1) have jetton 2) 0.01 is sufficient for its transfer (usually, 0.06 is required) 3) not mixed up arguments to getJettonWalletAddress (reply to 112000)

Yury: Okay, I'll check now. (reply to 112002)

Ma><im: hello! where can i find source code of v2 stonfi contracts?

Yury: Thanks for information I tried this, i create transaction, but get 709 code, I don't understand where I went wrong (reply to 112002)

Daniel: https://t.me/funcvietnam join func vietnam groupüí™

Coalus: Try to attach 0.05 TON instead of 0.01 TON. As you can see in the contract code, 709 error means "not enough ton" (reply to 112016)

Xinyao@InfStones: Hi team! Could you help with us: 1. Which type of token will be rewarded after staking the vesting token? vesting token or liquid token? 2. Is there any operation required to restore the validator if been slashed?

Yury: you can see the latest transactions please? I send 0.2 TON, 1 TON, but I get a code 709 https://testnet.tonviewer.com/0QAfi4vtFZsNMYQK87UxHGncK5QkXXuadvEph78YynhcxS1S

Yury: I've been trying to solve the problem of sending jettons for 3 days now

&rey: You're attempting to forward 0.2 TON out of 0.2 TON, aren't you? (reply to 112024)

Yury: I'm trying to send 10 jettons, and I put 0.2 TON in forwardAmount or did I misunderstand the question?

&rey: The issue is here. (reply to 112027)

Yury: and what needs to be done?

west: Find a developer Build ton-connect bridge  Use this package https://github.com/ton-connect/bridge  It is not a cross-chain bridge, but a bridge used to connect ton dapp and wallet

Coalus: U need to make "forwardAmount" smaller (reply to 112029)

Yury: What should the values ‚Äã‚Äãbe approximately? (reply to 112031)

west: Find a developer Build ton-connect bridge Use this package https://github.com/ton-connect/bridge It is not a cross-chain bridge, but a bridge used to connect ton dapp and wallet If you can help me complete this task, please contact me

Coalus: If it's a simple transfer from user to user you can set 1 nanoTON (reply to 112032)

Yury: even if i send jettons? (reply to 112034)

Haint: is this due to the fact that the generated func code is inefficient or another reason that I'm not aware of? (reply to 111973)

&rey: Also, my FunC code was manually optimized compared to common jetton impls. (reply to 112039)

Heydar: bro do we have better APIcenter?  or better way? I need to create something exactly like history of wallet in tonkeeper, It's too hard to use this apis ... (reply to 108535)

&rey: Transactions older than 2 weeks or so are only stored due to good will of certain nodes or indexers. (reply to 108534)

Heydar: guys how I can make a history list like tonkeeper wallet? by python ? can someone give me a good API center or any way?

&rey: pytoniq might help you. It requires no API, connecting to liteservers directly. (reply to 112045)

west: Build ton-connect bridge  Use this package https://github.com/ton-connect/bridge  It is not a cross-chain bridge, but a bridge for connecting ton dapp and wallet

Heydar: but tonkeeper showing you so old transactions too!? or even tonviewer how we can be like them? (reply to 112046)

&rey: Connect to archival node (knowing contents of block with seqno 1), it will return all transactions. (reply to 112049)

Heydar: so is that available in pytoniq (sdk)? or do we have better  API(rest or graphql) that make these response with abstractions? (reply to 112050)

&rey: It is. (reply to 112051)

Heydar: thanks , and please can I ask last question? tonkeepr is using which of them? (sdk or even api endpoint name) (reply to 112052)

&rey: tonapi (tonconsole) (reply to 112053)

Heydar: lol why this happen , I just asked a technical question üòê @admin (reply to 112056)

TwT: Yes, you scam. Don't ready for call and not talk about payment (reply to 112061)

west: Why should I answer your call? How can I answer your call if I don't know English? Is there something wrong with your brain? (reply to 112065)

TwT: you are a filipino scammer, you can't even estimate the cost of the work (reply to 112067)

west: Are you an idiot? Where did we mention money from the beginning to the end? Did you say how much? I didn't tell you my budget. Are you an idiot? You are a drug-addled idiot biting people here. (reply to 112069)

TwT: Don't work with him, He cheap Philippines schoolboy (reply to 112071)

TwT: Check your data in doxbin

west: Our chat was just a few short sentences. Did I tell you my budget? Did you tell me how much you wanted? We didn't even mention money. You idiot said I'm not going to pay you. Are you mentally ill? Go to the hospital for a checkup and don't delay your treatment.

TwT: Another data I'm upload in doxbin (reply to 112080)

west: I can't speak English, so I can't talk to you through Google meet and Nexcall, and you, you idiot, said I lied to you? What did you lie to me about? What did I do? Or what did you do? You idiot, all the chat records are there, I dare to take them out directly. Why are there low-IQ children like you in this group? (reply to 112075)

TwT: Goodluck ripper (reply to 112082)

west: I need to remind everyone, don't click on this scammer's link, and don't believe what this scammer says.

luis: Hello, who can tell me how I can verify a Jetton token contract so that it doesn't mark me as a SUSPICIOUS transaction in Tonviewer?

Egene: There are plenty of ways to do this, some harder but more reliable some easier but less reliable.  It is too long to explain in a single message, but if you want to reach out and explain what exactly you are trying to do I can try and give you some advice on what has and has not worked for our team of devs. (reply to 112043)

Ali: Hello friends, how can I get some tokens (jetton) on the Ton testnet network?

&rey: You can mint some. The common way: https://minter.ton.org/?testnet=true. (reply to 112117)

Ali: Can you please explain more? (reply to 112118)

&rey: Which thing, specifically? Transferring 'em, perhaps? (reply to 112119)

Exit Liquidator: Guys is there a tone wallet that can be used specifically for testnet?

Exit Liquidator: For example in tonkeeper, I can go to dev menu and set up a testnet account. But the mainnet will be still active

Exit Liquidator: I REALLY need a solution

Exit Liquidator: So when I connect to some testnet dapps with my tonkeeper, they just take my mainnet address, not the testnet one (reply to 112125)

Exit Liquidator: So I need a solution for a browser wallet that has TON testnet ONLY

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: My own liteserver did synchronize but it behaves super weird when i make requests to it. Ton LiteClient receives a response for the first request but subsequent requests through the same connection time out.

Exit Liquidator: I hear Ton Keeper can do it, but I couldn't achieve it

&rey: That's dApp issue with formatting addresses, probably. (reply to 112128)

‡∫ÆÍ´Ä’©√≠: Hi guys

Mehrdad: In the Tonkeeper Chrome extension, go to Settings.  Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings page.  While holding down the Ctrl key, click on the TON logo 5-6 times (fast!) (reply to 112131)

Mehrdad: give me your testnet wallet address in private message and I will send you some just for start, after some chalanges you will learn how to mint your own easily! (reply to 112117)

Michaell: Fam, is it possible to integrate the telegram migame into the website or app so users can play directly from there?  If yes, what steps are needed to make it happen?

&rey: Fundamentally, said game is website. TMA is but a form of delivery to users, with certain bans on content. Application is another form, which requires writing native app code instead of webpage though. (reply to 112240)

Michaell: So it is possible, but not easy?  can't use api? (reply to 112246)

&rey: I have said that you ALREADY have a website if you have a TMA. (reply to 112247)

Akachi: Yeah, TMA itself is website. (reply to 112248)

Akachi: var dict_balances = ds.slice_bits() == 0 ? new_dict() : ds~load_dict();  Do I need to check the dict variable is empty or not to initialize? Or is it okay to use the following way?  var dict_balances = ds~load_dict();

Michaell: Understood, I mean users can't play on my own project website/app  To play TMA on my own project web/app is impossible? (reply to 112248)

&rey: The latter way is preferable; you then have to write bit '0' for empty dict during initial storage construction. (reply to 112250)

&rey: If so, you must fix your script so that it does not crash when opened outside of Telegram. (reply to 112252)

Michaell: that's what I said, it is not easy (reply to 112254)

&rey: Is it? I find it hard to write code which would fail outside of Telegram, instead.  Though, you may need some software architect knowledge. @tonhunt is appropriate for searching for it; TON Society chats might also be fine. (reply to 112256)

Michaell: take a lot of time to development, with in months (reply to 112257)

&rey: You might've heard of some developers who work faster and produce better applications. They do exist (even though hard to find, and requested salary does not indicate them very well). (reply to 112258)

Kerimova: Hello, please tell me how to get information about the pool directly from the Ton blockchain, and not from the STON dex. And will it be necessary to decrypt it?

Akachi: Can you let me know if is there any specific reason of using second is preferable? (reply to 112253)

&rey: Because of less branching (and instructions, actually), it is cheaper for TVM. Storing extra bit also allows to keep multiple (<= 4) dictionaries in one cell without risk to mix them up. (reply to 112266)

Token: use tonapi, and if need detail information, just analyze from the api (reply to 112263)

&rey: Depends on the exact pool. Generally, you can retrieve contract state by address, and then parse it locally.  DEX are not generally intended to have standardized read interface (as contracts cannot read others' data), so parse will be required. (reply to 112263)

Madre: No, this seed was generated randomly, but it absolutely valid (reply to 112223)

Akachi: I mean, how did you create wallet from seed phrase? Importing to wallet or using script? (reply to 112271)

Madre: Import existing mnemonic in Tonkeeper (reply to 112272)

darshan: How withdraw in toncoin in blockchain

Akachi: So did you import mneomoic in Tonkeeper. Then you just need to switch to the testnet in Tonkeeper. (reply to 112274)

Madre: You absolutely right, but I already did it :) (reply to 112277)

Akachi: Then, how could the address can be different, because you just switch the chain in one account in Tonkeeper. :) (reply to 112278)

Catid: helow  anyone can help  i use ton connect ui react  when shending transcation  how to proof that without read the api Seqno ?

Madre: I also don't understand it. Same seed, same(almost) app TonKeeper and Tonkeeper-web, but different balances and addresses

Akachi: Yeah, that's weird, so when you switch the chain, then the address is also changed? It might be the bug of Tonkeeper. :) (reply to 112281)

&rey: There can be no proof without reading blockchain. (Actually, there might be no transaction.) (reply to 112280)

Madre: Yep, "O" prefix for testnet, and "U" prefix for mainnet, it works regular (reply to 112283)

&rey: What do you mean actually? TON can by definition only exist inside of blockchain; what do you want to do, knowing that? (reply to 112275)

ae: How do we interact with jettons after deployment? like minting? I can't find any examples.

&rey: Please look into the repository carefully. wrappers ‚Äî> JettonMinter.ts ‚Äî> sendMint may be of interest for you. (reply to 112295)

Denisa: Hello. Is there a library or any already built functionality regarding Merkle Trees on Ton?

Marc: Can anyone tell me what is the point of TON?

Marc: but like how is it better than aws? (reply to 112304)

Madre: The same as any other cryptocurrency, but with a comfortable interface in Telegram :) (reply to 112303)

Marc: but in what way? (reply to 112307)

Madre: Wait, you mean Amazon Web Services, or what? :D (reply to 112305)

Marc: yes

Madre: How is AWS towards cryptocurrencies?

&rey: Please stop speculating; there was stated point of TON, there is current expansion direction, etc.

Marc: could you send me the link the stated point of TON and current expansion direction? (reply to 112312)

Marc: I mean, I don't understand much, but as far as I understand, TON is somewhere you host the logic of the application same as AWS (reply to 112311)

&rey: Original is at https://docs.ton.org/ton.pdf. A flexible multi-blockchain platform (TON Blockchain; cf. Chapter 2), capable of processing millions of transactions per second, with Turing-complete smart contracts, upgradable formal blockchain specifications, multi-cryptocurrency value transfer, support for micropayment channels and off-chain payment networks. TON Blockchain presents some new and unique features, such as the self-healing vertical blockchain mechanism (cf. 2.1.17) and Instant Hypercube Routing (cf. 2.4.20), which enable it to be fast, reliable, scalable and self-consistent at the same time. (reply to 112313)

Marc: Well, that is a technical explanation of how ton works, but I am more interested in how it is helpful for the business (reply to 112315)

Marc: Like what real problems it solves

Madre: This is a very strange way of looking at things. Yes, TON can be used to execute your business logic through smart contracts, but first of all it is a cryptocurrency that allows you to pay for any services (reply to 112314)

&rey: Blockchain. It can be used for automatic, verifiable decisions like asset transfers: smart contracts guarantee that when action A (incoming transfer, actually) is done, action B is done afterwards.  With some trust in oracles, set of actions A becomes "events": for instance, price of something crossing a given threshold. Then, automatic actions can balance said price change, etc. (reply to 112316)

Mehmet Ali: Anyone, working on TACT, we need a TAX enabled contract example. That if the jetton is transfered a %8 amount will be transfered to owner.

Marc: I see, this makes more sense (reply to 112319)

Kerimova: I looked at the API tone, but did not find any endpoints for getting data from the pool(( (reply to 112268)

Marc: does anyone know if there is like an api where one can fetch all the telegram mini apps?

&rey: Fundamentally there can't be one, since some TMAs are private. (reply to 112327)

Token: @radar_tg_bot (reply to 112327)

Madre: I think this is impossible, since the mini-app can be passed for user simply as a link to any resource through a bot. But at the same time there is a Telegram App Center with approved apps: https://tapps.center (reply to 112327)

BigBang: Have you resolved it yet? (reply to 110164)

Salmono: Good morning guys, I have a problem with the multi-sender feature  This happens when sending toncoin assets to a new or inactive address, it is returned to the sender's wallet with a description calling the contract "bounce".

&rey: Feature might have missed that. (reply to 112364)

Salmono: Ah its deleted üòÅ

Salmono: I think maybe the same thing happens in the case of air drop if the token distribution uses multi sender?  Moreover, there must be many participants with inactive wallets. (reply to 112366)

I am using cryptocurrency for the first time and 2-3 weeks ago I put up a Fragment collectible username - they placed a bet on it and (it seems) it was bought at auction - today the auction ended. The buyer paid 10 TON, which went for a walk through the wallets, and 4.5 TON was indicated to me for a refund (conditionally). And now in my channel username is shown as collectible. However, 4.5 TON are stuck on a wallet unknown to me and are hanging there. It's been a little less than a day since the sale itself. Thanks

Max: Hey guys, I‚Äôd love to pay $25 for an answer, why the following USDT transfer code causes 49 Error (invalid_message)   // Pack the USDT transfer message         let packed = beginCell()         .store(             storeTokenTransfer({                 $$type: "TokenTransfer",                 query_id: BigInt(Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)),                   amount: BigInt(10000000000),                 destination: contractAddress,                 response_destination: userAddress,                 custom_payload: forward_string_test,                 forward_ton_amount: toNano("0.34"),                 forward_payload: newTradeCell,             })         )         .endCell();                      const transaction = {             validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60, // 60 sec             messages: [                 {                     address: usdtWalletAddress.toString(),                     amount: "530000000", // 0.53 TON                     payload: packed.toBoc().toString("base64")                 }             ]         };                  const result = await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(transaction);  Interestingly, the same code worked fine with other jettons

&rey: You're trying to send 10'000 USDT. Are you sure that's correct? Also, error codes might be reused. (reply to 112462)

Max: I tried sending 1, didn‚Äôt work either  Seems like the message body/format is incorrect (reply to 112467)

&rey: Forward payload is serialized incorrectly; probably because you use Tact template. It should be written like   .storeCoins(toNano('0.34'))  // forward_ton_amount   .storeMaybeRef(newTradeCell)  // forward_payload (reply to 112462)

Heydar: do we have a thin utility library  for ton interacting in C++?  for example converting address to another formats by that.

Max: Something like this?  let packed = beginCell()     .store(         storeTokenTransfer({             $$type: "TokenTransfer",             query_id: BigInt(0),             amount: toNano(usdtAmount),             destination: marketContractAddress,             response_destination: userAddress,             custom_payload: null,             forward_ton_amount: toNano("0.14"),             forward_payload: beginCell()                 .storeCoins(toNano('0.34'))  // forward_ton_amount                 .storeMaybeRef(newTradeCell)  // forward_payload                 .endCell()         })     )     .endCell(); (reply to 112483)

Jason: Related to a TON app I was thinking of building. (reply to 112510)

Jason: I am surprised this is considered private as this data is readily available when searching the relevant app on TG

Kerimova: Hi everyone! I‚Äôm really hoping for your help)  I sent a request to /api/v3/accountStates to obtain information about the pool(s).  Request:   GET https://toncenter.com/api/v3/accountStates?address=EQCpiBkP3tfsReBtkelWmtBY0kyf53HPi9G7W7A5cMcxuFQ&includeboc=true  The problem is that I do not understand how to decode the received information further, and what exactly is encoded in data_boc regarding the pools.  Code:   async function main() {     const [data] = await syncPoolsService.fetchPoolData(["EQCoso0JfwkG-wH3zEgdcttOr0_zO9gOnG50CxJaLOFHNMDX"]); // Fetching pool data     const byteArray = base64ToBytes(data.data_boc); // Converting the base64 string to a byte array      const [cells] = Cell.fromBoc(byteArray); // Creating Cell from the byte array      const slice = cells.beginParse(); // Getting the slice     console.log(slice); }  main();   Terminal output:   Slice {   array: Uint8Array(40) [     101, 175,  49,   7, 164,   0,   8,   1, 178,      50,  14, 213, 174, 183,  60, 204, 183,  42,     253, 199, 220,  69, 216, 191, 107, 136, 211,     227, 199,  33, 120,  48, 193, 152,  54, 159,     221,  89,  51, 192   ],   length: 320,   readCursor: 0,   refs: [     Slice {       array: [Uint8Array],       length: 16,       readCursor: 0,       refs: [Array],       refCursor: 0     },     Slice {       array: [Uint8Array],       length: 80,       readCursor: 0,       refs: [Array],       refCursor: 0     }   ],   refCursor: 0 }

&rey: Because of a top-grade decision in TON to write 2/3 of total forward fee into message cell.  It is not intuitive but somewhat justified: 1/3 is taken by origin shard validators, 2/3 are taken at destination. (reply to 112790)

Pandemoniuz: Hello there. Is it possible to account gas paid for ext-out message sending whilst sending internal message with +64 (carry remaining inbound) flag?  Currently what happens on my blueprint smartcontract test is: 1. Value of msg_value after some gas was consumed by vm execution is 1898623600ng 2. Contract sends ext-out message. 3. It tries to send internal message with +64 mode, but fails with vm message not enough grams to transfer with the message : remaining balance is 1898089200ng, need 1898623600 (including forwarding fees).  If I comment out sending of ext-out message, everything works fine.

Oleksandr: thanks, in case of usage old model where it is not calculated like this, the function will be inoperable? (reply to 112792)

&rey: I don't think there has been any exhaustive check which would determine what impls fail and what succeed. (reply to 112795)

&rey: Almost always, flag 128 is better suited for keeping contract balance as-is. (reply to 112794)

Oleksandr: thank you, do you have any link to documentation describing this? i just want to understand the impact (reply to 112796)

&rey: No. The reasons for accounting forward fee are mainly educated guesses. (reply to 112798)

Pandemoniuz: +128 is for forwarding remaining balance of the whole contract with the new message  What I need is to forward only TONs that are remaining from the ones received in input message of this execution (reply to 112797)

Pandemoniuz: +64 works great for this purpose, but for some reason it doesn't take ext-out message sending fees into account

&rey: IIRC +64 doesn't even account for storage fee, so your contract balance decreases over time. (reply to 112801)

&rey: raw_reserve(0, 4) before sending anything. (reply to 112800)

Pandemoniuz: I'll check it out, tyvm (reply to 112803)

Max: Hey guys, I‚Äôm having a hard time parsing a forward_payload in a USDT transfer. Am I missing anything here? Am I packing the message correctly?  1. Here‚Äôs how I send USDT on the front-end: let issueTicketsCell = beginCell()             .storeUint(2726147798, 32) // op code             .storeBit(1) // provideLiquidity (bool) flag as 1 bit             .storeCoins(toNano(desiredPrice)) // desiredPrice             .endCell();  // Pack the USDT transfer message const packed = beginCell()                 .storeUint(0xf8a7ea5, 32) // opcode for jetton transfer                 .storeUint(0, 64) // query id                 .storeCoins(usdtAmount * 1e6) // Jetton amount for transfer (decimals = 6 - USDT, 9 - default). Function toNano use decimals = 9 (remember it)                 .storeAddress(marketContractAddress) // TON wallet destination address                 .storeAddress(issuerAddress) // response excess destination                 .storeBit(0) // no custom payload                 .storeCoins(toNano("0.2")) // forward amount (if >0, will send notification message)                 .storeBit(1) // we store forwardPayload as a reference                 .storeRef(issueTicketsCell) // forwardPayload                 .endCell();  2. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm trying to read it in my Tact contract: try {     let messageCode: Int = msg.forward_payload.loadUint(32);  // Trying to retreieve the op code  } catch (e) {     // Always fails }

TKAINU: i deploy new jetton token,How can I display the price like USDT (reply to 112921)

Abdulaziz: You has deployed stable jetton token? I think you can't do like usdt because token price depends on supply and demand (reply to 112935)

Peng: hi guys im running ton-indexer it seem to be stuck pending trace  have anyone face this issue before?

sangmin: Is it possible to multi send using tonweb library??

Peng: sorry im not familiar with this (reply to 112941)

Peng: i am just running ton-indexer via offical github repo with offical docker compose and docker file pointed to my ton-node db

sangmin: I'm in the same situation. I restarted my indexer. (reply to 112940)

Peng: Did it work? (reply to 112945)

sangmin: yes

Peng: I restarted multiple times

Peng: Can i see your docker compose?

Peng: U are using the official github dockefile right?

sangmin: Have you tried restarting docker compose?

Tom: I tried to estimate fwd_fee of forward_payload depending on their bits and cells but it always gives false result. Could you please explain.  export function computeFwdFees(msgPrices: MsgPrices, cells: bigint, bits: bigint) {     return msgPrices.lumpPrice + (shr16ceil(msgPrices.bitPrice * bits + (msgPrices.cellPrice * cells))); }  For example, forward_payload with - 535 bits, 3 cells => expected 21801200n fwd_fee but the ~dump for the fwd_value (before/after muldiv32) are 730406n/1095609n - 1063 bits, 6 cells => expected 42922400n fwd_fee. Dump is giving  951208n/1426812n (reply to 112792)

Peng: You mean Docker compose restart?  Yes i did many times (reply to 112952)

Peng: Or you meant docker service itself

sangmin: If so, have you tried changing TON_WORKER_FROM in .env?

Peng: yes i did i set it close to newest block height 40880000

Peng: and than i get this pending traces

Sandy: Hello everyone, how can we determine if a transaction is a simple transfer, token transfer, swap, or NFT transfer? Would be great if find the opcodes for these. Thanks in advance!

Cyril M |: what's the wrap jetton token for TON?

Vladik: sup guys) I have a question about the transaction fees, can someone tell me how to dynamically calculate a fee before actual transfer?

&rey: Do you have understanding of transaction phases? (reply to 112991)

Vladik: not really, but as I understood for simple TON transfer, there are 2 phases (reply to 112992)

Vladik: im pretty new to ton, so will be grateful for any help

Tadeusz: Hello there!   Guys, there's a problem with full node deploy. Trying to deploy node via ton-community/ton-docker-ctrl/blob/main/docker-compose.yml (dump=true).  After downloading 193gb the node crashed.  node.addr_list().size() > 0 failed  unfortunately I can't post the pastebin link here, the bot deletes it.

&rey: There are two transactions, with several phases each... 1. external msg to source wallet: <nothing to credit>, storage phase, computation phase, action phase 2. msg with money to dest wallet: credit phase, storage phase, computation phase, <no actions>. (reply to 112995)

Vladik: so, for usual ton transfer, i should consider all phases in order to calculate the total fee, right ? (reply to 112999)

Akachi: I need to store some smart contract addresses in my smart contract. And according to the selected address, I need to call the function of that smart contract of selected address from my smart contract. Is this possible?

Akachi: @pcrafter Can you have a look on this and help me if you don't mind, please? (reply to 113042)

&rey: No, by construction of TON; you only can send a message there. (reply to 113042)

Akachi: The problem is to store the addresses of the smart contracts. Like mapping variable in Solidity, I can implement it like mapping (address  => bool ) smartContractVariables in EVM. Then, I can add/remove address as needed. Is it possible in TON? Then, how can I implement it? (reply to 113044)

&rey: cell, and use it for dictionary (267-bit address => ()). (reply to 113045)

Akachi: Hmm, can you give me specific solution? Like  var dict_addresses = ds~load_dict();  But when we store the dict_addresses~udict_set(31, id, data) id can only be the integer, not the address? (reply to 113046)

Heydar: swapping unverified tokens in ston.fi can be a scam? I mean they sent tokens , and I can swap the tokens to TON in ston.fi  if I confirms that , it can be an issue?

Heydar: smart contracts can steal money from wallets without 12-24 words (prv keys)? (reply to 113130)

&rey: No (unless they are installed as plugins, but you're unable to do that by accident).  dApps may merely ask you to transfer all valuables to certain contract, sometimes with wrong emulation which'd show you receiving something in exchange. (reply to 113131)

&rey: It's better to do in programmatic way; TON is especially good for that, as the first message upper-bounds how much you can lose.  (About custom tokens: check that jetton wallet returned by it is of that jetton, not of USDT, as otherwise you may be scammed to transfer a more expensive jetton.) (reply to 113130)

TKAINU: How to withdraw excess ton from my contract, does anyone have an example? Thank you very much

Haint: 1. define an operation to withdraw excess 2. use raw_reserve to indicate how much you want to keep in your contract 3. send msg back to your wallet with mode 128 (reply to 113180)

TKAINU: Am I doing this right? (reply to 113181)

&rey: Almost. Remember that outgoing message has some structure which you violated. (reply to 113184)

TKAINU: Can you help me point it out? I can't find the error (reply to 113185)

&rey: /unwarn (reply to 113185)

&rey: Correct code would be begin_cell()   .store_uint(0x18, 6)   .store_uint(sender_address)   .store_coins(0)   .store_uint(0, 107)   .end_cell()   .send_raw_message(128); You can check out differences in docs, or in chat history, or ask. (reply to 113186)

Haint: If you do it like this, everyone can claim the excess. (reply to 113184)

Denys: Hi all, please help me with ECRECOVER. I have this code, which should recover public key from message hash and signature:  #include "imports/stdlib.fc";  (int, int, int, int) ecdsa_recover(int hash, int v, int r, int s) asm "ECRECOVER";  (int, int, int, int) get_ecdsa_pub_key(int hash, int v, int r, int s) method_id {         return ecdsa_recover(hash, v, r, s); }  () recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure { }  As you can see ECRECOVER returns 4 numbers, the first 3 are the values from which the public key can be retrieved and the 4th is a boolean value which means whether the public key was successfully recovered or not. I want to do this check recovered_pubkey == signer_pubkey.  The question is, how can I get the public key from these 3 numbers so that I can compare it with another address?

&rey: You can't compare public key with address, as those are unrelated entities. (reply to 113206)

Denys: and how to get the address from the public key, or the public key from the address, or how to solve this situation differently? (reply to 113208)

&rey: 1. If signer is sending message, then just check that message comes from them (source address in in_msg_full).  2. Otherwise, store signer public key in contract directly, and use check_signature.

&rey: Note: a) you can't get address from public key as there is a lot of wallets, with more to come b) you can't get public key from address as that requires reversing SHA-256 and, once again, knowing specific wallet code

&rey: c) contract interacting with yours may be automated, not having any keypairs for offchain control

Denys: Got it, thanks for the explanation. In this case the second option suits me, I will store the signer public key in the contract to compare it with the recovered one. But how do I get the public key from these 3 numbers that ECRECOVER returns?

&rey: You don't need to recover anything if you have original public key; you can simply check signature, as that has no unintuitive security implications. (reply to 113213)

sangmin: Please tell me how to multi-send ..üò≠

Denys: and tell me please, how do I get a public key (I understand it can be done from the seed phrase), but through the wallet (for example tonkeeper) it can not be done, I need to write code? (reply to 113214)

sangmin: I am setting it to 500 and testing it. After index-worker stops, there should be a stopped seqno in the /var/ton-work directory, but we expect it to be erased by ttl.

Peng: how do you change the ttl (reply to 113248)

sangmin: installer > set_node_argument ‚Äîstate-ttl 500

sangmin: unit sec

Peng: can you please tell me if setting to 500 did anything in restarting the state (reply to 113250)

sangmin: After setting 500 seconds, stop index-worker and restart index-worker after time to see if the same error occurs.

sangmin: I hope the indexer developers can solve it quickly...

Peng: but this ttl affects ton-node / mytonctrl which is fetching data to update our database blockheight right? not actually affecting index-worker  as long as  mytonctrl > status > Local validator out of sync is less than 20s means our ton-db is updated  if im not wrong index-worker is reading the db and reorginise it into postgres db so that index-api can work and qurery (reply to 113255)

TKAINU: I want to ask if there is a size limit for images of metadata?

Peng: i assume there is something wrong with index-worker instead of ttl on mytonctrl (reply to 113255)

sangmin: Is it working normally now?

Peng: oh wait you are asking me to test by changing ttl? i thought you tested it (reply to 113260)

sangmin: No, I'm the only one who needs to test. Is there any change since the number you showed me earlier?

Peng: now no (reply to 113262)

sangmin: Maybe /var/ton-work doesn't have 40880002 number block? (reply to 113263)

Sarkinüê∏: I have 3 NFT

Denys: please tell me if it is possible to do func insertions in tact code?

Sarkinüê∏: Do you need (reply to 113288)

Denys: I don't know yet, just interested in the possibility. Tact is a relatively new language, so if it suddenly doesn't have the tools I need, can I add them using func? (reply to 113289)

Sarkinüê∏: Yes

Sarkinüê∏: Just save my number in private I'll send it to you (reply to 113290)

Denys: For example, I went to the Tact documentation and it says that you can't upgrade contracts in this language, unlike func.

Kerimova: Hello everyone again)   I found an endpoint on TON for getting information about several pools at once: /api/v3/accountStates.   And how data_boc is encoded in STONFI:  if (op == getter_pool_data) {      var payload = begin_cell()         .store_uint(getter_pool_data, 32)         .store_uint(query_id, 64)         .store_coins(storage::reserve0)         .store_coins(storage::reserve1)         .store_slice(storage::token0_address)         .store_slice(storage::token1_address)         .store_ref(begin_cell()             .store_uint(storage::lp_fee)             .store_uint(storage::protocol_fee)             .store_uint(storage::ref_fee)             .store_slice(storage::protocol_fee_address)             .store_coins(storage::collected_token0_protocol_fee)             .store_coins(storage::collected_token1_protocol_fee)         .end_cell());     send_payload(sender_address, payload.end_cell());     return (true); }   But I can't decode it (the addresses throw an 'unsupported address type' error, and the other values are decoded incorrectly). What could be the mistake? Has anyone worked with this?   async function main(address) {     const data = await syncPoolsService.fetchPoolData(address); // Get pool data     const byteArray = base64ToBytes(data[0].data_boc); // Convert base64 string to byte array     const cells = Cell.oneFromBoc(byteArray); // Create Cell from byte array     const slice = cells.beginParse(); // Get slice     const dataPool = {         op: slice.loadUint(32).toString(),         query_id: slice.loadUint(64).toString(),         reserve0: slice.loadCoins().toString(),         reserve1: slice.loadCoins().toString(),         token0_address: slice.loadAddress().toString(),         token1_address: slice.loadAddress().toString(),         additional_data: {             lp_fee: slice.loadRef().loadUint(16).toString(),             protocol_fee: slice.loadRef().loadUint(16).toString(),             router_address: slice.loadRef().loadAddress().toString(),             protocol_fee_address: slice.loadRef().loadAddress().toString(),             total_supply: slice.loadRef().loadCoins().toString(),             collected_token0_protocol_fee: slice.loadRef().loadCoins().toString(),             collected_token1_address: slice.loadRef().loadCoins().toString(),         }     }     console.log(dataPool); } main('EQD5-gID5XHfmwBl3Pm_iwnM3y9pbJZmW1M-2Sgz19uxBw28');

Deedee: hello, want store mapping like solidity in func, how i do that

Token: use dict (reply to 113308)

Deedee: like: global dict(slice,int) balances = dict_new();;

Token: you can log the data on first line of main function and can show us the result. I think address must be not string, just Address type, so Address(address) maybe Address import from ton/core (reply to 113303)

&rey: Admins have power to read deleted messages in groups.  Btw, deletion by Combot was just, as it had no way to know what was at the link. (reply to 113538)

Ton.: I sent the tonviewer link to show you our token

Ton.: Why this is happening i can not understand seriusly. We have updated DYOR we apdated dexscreener we reach mc to join Dedust..Gas.pump create our token we can not mint more or something like that. Have you any idea with who i have to speak for that one?

Ton.: If anybody could help guys i will appreaciated a lot cause we made some hard work with site socials pay dexscreener and for other verifications..

X üíé: Thanks for the advice mateü´∂üèª (reply to 113554)

Kushagra: Hi everyone, I want to distribute jetton to more than 100 users in a single transaction, is it possible to do it without a smart contract? Also any reference contract example?

Token: recommend highload wallet (reply to 113580)

Kushagra: Thank Son, I guess highload wallet is more for sending multiple transactions, here my ask is for just one transaction but multiple transfer. Are highload wallets useful for this as well? (reply to 113582)

&rey: Fundamentally, as >100 users will be credited on their jetton wallets, it is impossible to do in single transaction.  It's possible to send one message TO your wallet contract, then it will need to send >100 messages to your jetton wallet. preprocessed-wallet-v2 is particularly useful for this. (reply to 113580)

MoHaMaD üáÆüáπ: Guys, please answer this issue:   Repository:  ton-blockchain/ton    Number:  1259

MoHaMaD üáÆüáπ: I changed the snippet code with removing `var`: () transfer(slice to, int amount) impure {    slice sender = get_pugy_sender();     (slice owner, slice name, slice symbol, int decimals, int total_supply, cell balance_dict, cell approve_dict) = load_data();         int sender_balance = balance_dict.dict_get(256, sender);    throw_unless(error::insufficient_balance, sender_balance >= amount); But that error throwed again:  ``` Func compilation error: Pugy.fc:44:128: error: cannot assign an expression of type (slice, slice) to a variable or pattern of type (slice, slice, slice, int, int, cell, cell): cannot unify type (slice, slice, slice, int, int, cell, cell) with (slice, slice)      (slice owner, slice name, slice symbol, int decimals, int total_supply, cell balance_dict, cell approve_dict) = load_data(); ``` (reply to 113712)

&rey: Please try reordering functions so that load_data is on the top.  Also, are you aware that your token can be used by 32K people at the very most, and is now written incorrectly? (reply to 113713)

MoHaMaD üáÆüáπ: Why is my code incorrect? I don't know anything about it! I'm new to FunC. (reply to 113714)

MoHaMaD üáÆüáπ: Let I check it! (reply to 113718)

MoHaMaD üáÆüáπ: I renamed load_data() to pugy_load_data(), but this new error throwed: Func compilation error: Pugy.fc:35:40: error: lvalue expected before ~load_slice        slice name = name_ref.begin_parse()~load_slice(); (reply to 113718)

&rey: It's a lot to complain about; over all the code, developer assumes that things work a certain way.  ‚Äî The main issue which you'd notice immediately on testing, is that TON addresses are not 256-bit. ‚Äî On burn you're trying to transfer tokens to null address, which would only lead to failed action phase and no changes. ‚Äî Storing all balances in single contract. That could be justified, without ‚Äî Allowances. How are they supposed to be used? Also, there can be at most 32K allowances over all users, it is impossible to store more in a single contract. ‚Äî Burn is somewhy only allowed for admin. ‚Äî [continuing seems suspiciously like an audit, so I'll stop here] (reply to 113716)

&rey: Tonapi does that, or you can load transactions one-by-one until you hit one not produced by internal message. (I intentionally avoided "produced by external", as tx chain might be started by tick-tock transaction on the Elector.) (reply to 113747)

User<6934166783>: Hello!  I am developing my own exchange that will utilize Ton tokens. To effectively test the functionality and ensure the stability of the platform, I need 10,000 Ton test coins.  These funds will help test the exchange functions, deposit and withdrawal processes, as well as the user interface. I am confident that this testing will help identify potential issues and improve user experience on the platform.  Thank you in advance for your assistance and support!

Namon: hi everyone! Has anyone deployed cSBT? https://github.com/ton-community/compressed-nft-contract (collection_exotic_sbt.fc) For some reason, when I pass in claim transaction with proof with owner, content & authority, owner remains empty, content is passed correctly, and authority takes the value of owner  Does anyone have any idea what the problem might be?

Akachi: OH, so it should be 267, right? (reply to 113901)

Akachi: (slice, int) dict_get?(cell dict, int key_len, slice index) asm(index dict key_len) "DICTGET" "NULLSWAPIFNOT"; var (_, success) = has_contract.dict_get?(267, address); if (success == false) {     has_contract.dict_set(267, address,        begin_cell()       .store_int(-1, 32)       .end_cell()       .begin_parse()     ); }  I tried this, but still the success  is returning false, though I set the has_contract several times.

&rey: Doesn't matter: balance will become zero anyways. (reply to 113929)

Ksms: I have implemented a nativeReserve() before that, so the reason I am asking is to see if I hould reserve the storage fee also

Peng: no i mean, how do u force index-worker to start inserting data to postgres from block 1 (reply to 114156)

Peng: i use --from 1 it did not work or i use --force it did not work

sangmin: you need to download the dump file, but as far as I know, there is nothing to provide from number 1.

Peng: ahhh okay

Peng: so the only solution would be to run mytonctrl clean without dumps to get from number 1? (reply to 114159)

sangmin: Thank you. Can I get an example link? (reply to 114394)

sangmin: Is @ton/ton an online signature? I'm using an offline signature.

&rey: They refer to exactly same onchain action "send message to some contract". There might be difference in preprocessing message payload (sendTransaction does none, but sendTransfer might). (reply to 114383)

&rey: You mean, cold wallet? In any case, you can take code of either lib (wallet wrapper, specifically) and tweak it. (reply to 114396)

Cabdi Qaadir Cali: /Thank you for information Business

Frankie: Thank you for your response! My situation is: 1. We prepare a message to call from BE to contract. This message will store a new element of a dict with the key is string type 2. On the Contract side: we use store_slice to store a string that will be used as the key of dict 3. On the Backend side: We use storeSlice (with the string that we want to send to contract) to prepare the message. But we just can input the address type with storeSlice, we can not input string type. 4. We are using Nodejs and ton/core version 0.56.3  Could you please help me with my case? (reply to 114459)

&rey: There isn't such option, mainly for user funds safety. (reply to 114453)

&rey: Please note that all keys must have the same bit length, and be quite short (I'd suggest <= 800 bits = 100 bytes). (reply to 114458)

&rey: Also, storing addresses as strings is not a good idea, as there are multiple equivalent representations, and storing addresses in dict in a single contract is not a good idea either, unless you're sure there will be few participants (for contract to work cheaply enough, a fine limit would be 255).

Success: Hi

Frankie: Thank you for your response, I appologize if my English makes you confuse. We don't store addresses as strings, my situation is that we are trying to use storeSlice with string type in the backend side to prepare the message but the ton/core doesn't allow us.  We don't know how to send a string to contract from Backend üò¢ (reply to 114469)

Akachi: I agree, as address is represented as different formats. But what if we need to store address, any other solution? (reply to 114469)

&rey: ~dict_set(267, addr, content); ‚Äî check that addr is valid and not a null address (two zero bits) beforehand. (reply to 114480)

&rey: It is not implemented in common wallet apps, indeed. Whether it ever will, is an open question and largely depends on what projects are out there.  (Also, DAOs usually just aggregate multiple approval messages, from each owner individually.) (reply to 114475)

&rey: What would you even do with string there? Just forward it, I believe? I'd suggest putting it in a separate reference, as storeStringTail might take all space in current cell. (reply to 114474)

Justin: Thank you very much for your help. I am currently using multiple messages to implement this, and it seems that this is the only way to keep it for now. (reply to 114483)

Kunal: Does ton have alternate to for callStatic in ethereum, which is used to read only execute a function to check its output?

live: But when I build the message body this way, all the wallets that send messages to v1 are bounced, what is the reason for this?

BoOmar: Hello everyone, does anyone here know if there is a NFTs holders snapshot tool available on TON?

&rey: Because Tact's serialization is not entirely conforming to TEP-74. You need a zero bit in forward payload, to indicate that all of its non-existent data is written inline, not in ref. (reply to 114549)

live: Modify it like this? (reply to 114551)

&rey: This chat's rate limit. (reply to 114577)

peilipu: ok

peilipu: seems like i will got such error when i send transactions  too fast, how can i fix or prevent it happening

&rey: You can't send next transfer until previous one had changed wallet's seqno. (reply to 114581)

&rey: If you are able to group transfers, you should do so (on either wallet v3r2, preprocessed-v2 or wallet v5). If you aren't able to do that, use highload wallet.

peilipu: can i send transaction with customized seqno. like what i do in ethereum, example i parallel send txs with nonce 18,19,20,21...

&rey: For highload wallet only. Consider that it costs more. (reply to 114584)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: Excuse me, highload wallet operations costs more? (reply to 114593)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: 1tx with 1 message is more expensive on Highload Wallet V3 than on Simple V4 Wallet?? How much? Types of wallets are given for example. @pcrafter (reply to 114594)

&rey: preprocessed-wallet-v2: ~0.00152 TON v4[r2]: 0.002663084 TON (total network fee, including message receipt) highload-v2: ~0.00383 TON (reply to 114595)

Tim: What about v3? (reply to 114597)

&rey: I don't have one at hand; perhaps someone could test and share total fee as shown in Tonviewer? (reply to 114598)

Abdulaziz: What will happen if i put 1mb bytecode on Blockchain

&rey: You will be unable to do so. To start, contract may hold only 65536 unique cells in storage, and each can have 1023 bits of data at most. (reply to 114600)

Tim: I can send tx, but not sure if it‚Äôs optimal way (reply to 114599)

Abdulaziz: It says i can put 8mb maximum (reply to 114602)

&rey: highload v3r1: 0.00473039 TON (reply to 114597)

Abdulaziz: I think i can put whole nft image on Blockchain (reply to 114604)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: If I send 250 messages in one tx on highload wallet, would it be 250 * 0.0047... TON? (reply to 114605)

Abdulaziz: So it will be onchain fully (reply to 114606)

&rey: Slightly less. (reply to 114607)

&rey: IIRC there is also limit on external message, either 32 or 64 KB, so you won't be able to fit whole image at once; forward fee would be prohibitive as well. (reply to 114606)

Abdulaziz: I just wanna create unique nft which in onchain not ipfs, even if Blockchain storage is expensive (reply to 114611)

&rey: I've done that (https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/onchain-nft-collectioned) with smaller images. (reply to 114613)

Abdulaziz: Technically it's possible with bigger images, right? I guess onchain metadata makes collection more unique and expensive. (reply to 114614)

Abdulaziz: https://tonapi-img-cache.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/8831f6a3351f0682d705f97a7b65f5cc4ba10da8d8707a6522f9b1d47ef29897.webp

Abdulaziz: It's offchain or what

&rey: It's cache link. Deploy sends image to blockchain, not to some offchain service. (reply to 114616)

Abdulaziz: image_data is nft image on onchain right? (reply to 114618)

Abdulaziz: Is that base64 or what

chebu: which one? (reply to 114664)

chebu: thats a fine approach, you can always upgrade later (reply to 114668)

Max: It just seems like there‚Äôs no solution if we need thousands of RPS per second

chebu: you could place toncenter api behind your own rate limit / queue (reply to 114674)

Max: So should try to cap it at 1 request per second (reply to 114681)

I have researched the answer and I have got the answer that if the variable is null or invalid value, the dot "." will return a time exception but the tilde "~" will return null and not throw an exception. Is my answer correct?

&rey: It isn't. v~do_something() is same as (v, ()) = do_something(v); (reply to 114855)

Tuan: I'm new to FunC so can you explain more about (v,()) or any keyword for detail? (reply to 114856)

Its not fetching the transaction history after that hash transaction  Example tx1: lt 1 tx2: lt 2 tx3: lt 3  if i were to query for lt 2, it will give me transaction history of tx2 and tx3 and not tx1 and tx2 right?

&rey: You can fetch latest txs from TonClient; it has no lt/hash requirement. Alternatively, get account state. (reply to 114937)

Token: even possible, from one address, not two contract, so when second you deploy, it will just recall contract you first deployed. (reply to 114986)

&rey: No it isn't. Smart contract initial state is whatever you use for StateInit; contract address is deterministically derived from it. (reply to 114986)

Marat: I understood, thank you!

Tom: It‚Äôs like CREATE2 from EVM imo

yarik: does anyone know how to programmatically put up an nft for auction on fragment using smart contracts?

Luqman: Check right up your wallet, select three botton then report them (reply to 115070)

Crypto Lion: So I can do directly from my wallet? (reply to 115071)

Luqman: Which wallet you use? (reply to 115073)

Crypto Lion: TONKeeper

Crypto Lion: I was drained from some of my tokens and 2 NFTs and the thing is that I used a trusted Mini App site‚Ä¶ Boinkers

Luqman: Ok, click NFT then in left available botton of report (reply to 115077)

Crypto Lion: Give me a minute‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going there now

Luqman: Good (reply to 115079)

Crypto Lion: I don‚Äôt see an option (reply to 115080)

Crypto Lion: Can I dm you my address?

Tiqan: Hey. Is it possible to check if sender is from the same contract but with different data? So the code is the same but the data in the init is different.

Leo: yes if you know exactly what the code and data is - so you can check the calculated address matches sender address

Derick: Hello everyone, how can I use sandbox to change the block time in unit tests?

frogish: or reverse the transaction if that  is possible

Daniel: has anyone got a AxiosError: Request failed with status code 404   code: 'ERR_BAD_REQUEST', before even though the function exists in the contract? also weirdly this only happens to testnet and works fine locally

Pluto: hello, can someone will tell me how to identify if the wallet is testnet or mainnet?

Daniel: has anyone managed to call a read function that takes a slice as an arg in testnet/mainnet successfully?

Pluto: I don't know, I'm trying to do that, that's why I asked you guys (reply to 115167)

Nick: as far as I know the same address can exist in both testnet and mainnet separately (reply to 115166)

Nick: By the way don't you know guys how to activate the address in mainnet? Currently I have the address in mainnet and 2 TON on it, but it still has uninitialized state. How can I initialize that?  Activated by transferring the first transaction from this wallet to another

&rey: Being uninit is perfectly normal, you can use it already. (reply to 115175)

Nick: yeah, I figured out that to activate it I need to make a first transfer with some contract. Also I used the wrong wallet version. Life of ton dev integrator is challenging haha (reply to 115210)

Selcuk: Hey everyone,  We're working on a React-based e-commerce app inside Telegram and integrating a Unity game.  We ran into Telegram's policy that says: "You will not implement any ads or any external links on your custom URL pages [1]."  We're a bit confused about what counts as an "external link" in this context.  What exactly qualifies as an external link? Is it okay to link to other domains we own within our web app? Do we need to keep everything under a single domain, or can we use multiple domains that are all ours?  Has anyone dealt with this before or have any insights?  Thx!

D_d: Not yet, probably will do my own backend for it (reply to 115280)

&rey: You don't get to write init code as string. Rather, you must create a function cell push_init_code() asm   "B{B5EE9C...}"   "B>boc PUSHREF"; (reply to 115283)

Eibrahim: Yeah I think that's the case  It depends on your backend structure  You can't easily detect if a user follow an account or not the best approach is to set a timer and assuming they would have followed the page before the time elapse (reply to 115288)

George: tell me how to get the transaction hash. I make a transaction using the tongo library (I transfer ton V5 wallet)  I get the hash by calling extMsgCell.HashString() , but it does not match the hash of my transaction in the scanner

Eibrahim: Use data from your backend for example if you are tracking the time user was active  You can create a function to check if they have logged in a day (reply to 114926)

&rey: Indeed, because that's hash of sent external message; how'd it match? How would your lib get transaction hash? (reply to 115296)

Abdulaziz: Im t–∞lking –∞bout this (reply to 115311)

&rey: No common jettons do so. Less known ones (and scam, of course) can disappear or change in any way, on the other hand. (None are able to pull TON or other assets from the wallet, though, by design of TON.) (reply to 115309)

Abdulaziz: https://t.me/toncoin/1554 (reply to 115314)

Abdulaziz: I had this one thing (reply to 115311)

Abdulaziz: Yes i got one of this but it disappeared (reply to 115317)

&rey: is that a transaction? If so, does it have hash or something like that? (reply to 115311)

Abdulaziz: It's just screenshot of token. I mean i had one of this token. But it disappeared from my wallet (reply to 115319)

Abdulaziz: tonviewer doesn't not show how that happened

&rey: Then it means that you neglected to claim them, as the offer was limited in time. (reply to 115321)

Abdulaziz: I already had this token on my address. why i should claim what i have (reply to 115322)

Abdulaziz: And m–∞x supp was 18,000,000

Abdulaziz: It became 21k

Abdulaziz: How did they stole token from my wallet

&rey: I don't understand why you expect anything particular of this token,  but that was probably an unfortunate representation by Tonviewer. You had no blockchain-confirmed record of having tokens; Tonviewer showed how much you could claim; now you can't claim any.

Abdulaziz: It cost 25$ (reply to 115328)

Abdulaziz: That's wh—É, i had this token but it disappeared

&rey: Demand from users now forces developers into inconvenient situation, as they intended to remove any liquidity for trading but now can't. (I predict any further discussion about Mintless Points will either reiterate what I said or be off topic.) (reply to 115329)

Abdulaziz: I mean how does it disappeared (reply to 115332)

Abdulaziz: Due to the nature of the blockchain, no one can steal a token without having the private key.

Abdulaziz: This is somehow unclear

&rey: Learn to read please: > you neglected to claim them, as the offer was limited in time. > You had no blockchain-confirmed record of having tokens; Tonviewer showed how much you could claim; now you can't claim any. (reply to 115334)

Abdulaziz: But Tonviewer said that I already have this token, and it was in the "tokens" section. (reply to 115337)

&rey: You should ask @subden for a clearer representation that some tokens are not claimed yet and may expire. (reply to 115338)

Abdulaziz: In short, in order for me to keep the token, I should make at least one transaction with it?

Abdulaziz: In general, out of 18 million, only 21k or less people figured this out. (reply to 115342)

Denis: It was a test token

Abdulaziz: Now people wanna buy it for more than 25$ for each one (reply to 115344)

User<7133336342>: hello

Luis: Hello anyone here using the sdks for golang. Do you know how to check the status of a txn using tongo or ton-utils-go?

Token: Hi, guys, on Ton, like solana, we sign the transaction with wallet and on backend, can confirm that?

&rey: On TON, some smart contracts (called "wallets" for obvious reasons) accept signed messages and execute transfer orders embedded in them.  Those transfer orders can be signed either by wallet apps (which then immediately send the message into blockchain) or libraries. (reply to 115372)

Mehrdad: In fact, there is no way to check the status of a transaction unless you define a specific method for doing so. For example, you could check the receiving account for incoming transactions related to your transaction, or you could monitor the blockchain to see how many blocks have been mined since your transaction was included.

Token: thanks for reply, so I mean, not blockchain, out of the chain, with kind of proof, we can confirm that transaction, because we want when users confirm the transaction, not from wallet to chain directly, confirm that transaction on backend based on user's sign (reply to 115376)

&rey: Wallet apps don't support signing something but not sharing it to blockchain. (reply to 115378)

Token: so for example, users can transfer Ton with their wallet, but if they use our platform for that, then we gonna give kind of bonus,  But don't want to use api for detect that, users just sign and on our service backend, want to verify that and do extra work for users, so you mean, is it impossible? (reply to 115379)

Token: hum... then is there any solution? really interested in Ton but actually compare to solana or EVM, important things are missing... ^_^ (reply to 115380)

&: So you want to control user's wallet in your backend? (reply to 115381)

Token: nah, nonono, just confirm the transaction. lol (reply to 115382)

&: I can't understand what you exactly wanna do at here. So if user transfer TON to others via your platform. user can get bonus? (reply to 115380)

Token: kind of yes, ofc it's business, anyway as Mehrdad Amini said(thanks for reply ^_^) we can't use api for detect transactions for all users, so when they use our platform to send transaction, via our backend, add more service (reply to 115384)

&: "use our platform to send transaction" is not clear. You mean all the transactions? (reply to 115385)

Token: uhm... so kind of deposit ton to some pools. :) (reply to 115386)

Token: so any solution, guys???

Token: I think many devs will face this problem,

Luis: How can I do so? Is there any code example? (reply to 115377)

Mehrdad: personaly, I use tonapi.io api events field  status to be "ok".  look these links: https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/events/d6a8b9c3914ea503e3dbcb8cff3f0a033c9b41cd73b3f7b8e63de12395acce0e  and : https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/events/f0cb236eeb00048089126262aa06c1ac9b0c933c91aa4e84aee5fd988850cbb6   but for advanced checking you can use another scenarios, like: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/transactions/get_try_locate_result_tx_tryLocateResultTx_get  ....

Token: nah, even you are true, so we have to run API in real time for users? really insufficient (reply to 115399)

Token: what is it for?

Madre: Hi everyone, what is the best way to make sure that a jetton transaction has gone through and been confirmed? I am currently querying all transactions of the jetton wallet from which the transaction was sent and looking for inMsg with opcode 0x0f8a7ea5 (Jetton Transfer in TVM), parsing and identifying the transaction by its queryId. Is this the optimal way, or is there an easier way? It would also be nice to skip all transactions that were made earlier than the expected time, but it seems that for this you need to get the current block logical time from TON at the time of issuing the address, which seems a bit time-consuming

&: Did you tried to use .then(a => .....)? (reply to 115402)

&rey: You can forward user funds via your contract. It can even distribute rewards onchain, where applicable. (reply to 115381)

&: To do that. you have to make a special contract to support user's particular & limited actions. User can send tx to your contract, and contract will help user to do that action. You can input benefits for user at here.  To track all the transactions from all the users is IMPOSSIBLE I think. (reply to 115401)

Token: so let me explain a little more, on solana, users just sign the transaction  with wallet then return kind of  code, and send code to backend so on backend just verify the code and do something more, so on Ton, it's similar to tonproof? (reply to 115405)

&rey: tonproof can be used, but once per wallet connection (you can leverage this to create a bonus scheme but this is harder). I think absence of data signing option is intentional. (reply to 115407)

Madre: Transactions are sent from the frontend, and I want to get confirmation on the backend. All I can get from the frontend is the hash of the inMsg body, while the transaction ID itself remains unknown to me. (reply to 115404)

&rey: Something must wait until message is actually recorded. That will either be frontend or backend, or both for some optimization. (reply to 115411)

Madre: So, in other respects, this is a correct approach, excluding the nuance with logical time? (reply to 115413)

&rey: To acknowledge that jettons have been transferred and can now be used, you should listen to something (message unspecified by standard, but known for any specific jetton) at receiver's jetton wallet. (reply to 115414)

Madre: Okay, thank you so much for your answers

Laisky: I am quite skeptical about the possibility of implementing flash loans in the Actor model's ledger. (reply to 115464)

Martin: I am trying to implement the liquidation function for a lending project like Aave on EVM, which uses the flashloan. Do you guys have any idea to implement this one?

Laisky: I once discussed this issue with the people from the Arweave AO project (AO is also an Actor model). In the end, we came up with a very complex implementation scheme, but it has never been actually implemented, so I'm not sure if it can truly be used. (reply to 115472)

Martin: We are discussing about building a smart contract that holds assets, then we can take the asset out to liquidate user's positions. But this one may be high-cost and risky.  What do you think of it? (reply to 115474)

Martin: Could you please share more about your idea? It's grateful to hear (reply to 115474)

Laisky: In fact, the result of our discussion at the time was quite similar; we needed a centralized contract to hold all the tokens involved in the transactions. (reply to 115475)

Victor: Hello everyone, I have a question, I have an idea for developing the following project: a data management system based on the TON modular system, a more advanced service that will provide users with the ability to securely store large, dense files, as well as the ability for users to create their own data, roughly speaking, a decentralized storage. The question is: does it make sense to develop a similar project on TON, when there is TON Storage and interfaces for it, because the technology on which my project is based differs from the technologies on which TON Storage is based (for example, TON Storage for storing files in p2p network uses Torrent 3.0, and I use the IPFS protocol suite)? And how much do you use TON Storage as a file storage?

User<7328481886>: Your project makes sense on TON despite the existence of TON Storage. The key differentiator is that your system uses the IPFS protocol instead of Torrent 3.0, offering benefits like content addressing and file versioning. This could appeal to users looking for advanced data management features. While TON Storage is available, its adoption may not be widespread, leaving room for your project to attract users seeking a more secure and flexible decentralized storage solution. (reply to 115769)

Victor: Thank you for your answer, I will be glad to hear other opinions on this project)

–êro: I'm looking at the documentation. There I see the code - .store_uint(123, 16). This function will add the number 123 with a length of 16 bits. But how? 123 is a maximum of 7 bits, where does 16 come from?

‚Å≠—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü–∞ –º–æ–ª–µ–∫—É–ª—ã: 0000001 (reply to 115856)

–êro: 7 bit, but in code in ton doc 16, whyüò∂ (reply to 115857)

‚Å≠—É—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ü–∞ –º–æ–ª–µ–∫—É–ª—ã: Your cell has 16 bits reserved for any data, digits less than 16 bits will simply be padded with zeros (reply to 115858)

–êro: So these are the "rules" of the ton, right? It makes me nervous that the documentation doesn't spell this sort of thing out (reply to 115859)

–êro: And especially their cookbook, which has useless "useful references" to assembly primitives. As if that makes it clearer..

&rey: That rule is of any computer science. (reply to 115860)

–êro: Why? There are certain rules. If I set 123 under 7 bits, that would be correct, wouldn't it? Why are more 0's being added? (reply to 115867)

&rey: From TVM rules: 1. Cell is but a bit sequence + refs sequence. 2. Integers are represented by i257 and shrinked (with bounds checking) as requested by builder-store primitives.

Naveen: Hi Team, After swap trying to transfer to another wallet getting error as Exit Code 47 , unable to find this in documentation of TON  any one faced similar issue,  USDT transfer works but other Jetton tokens its given either 47/48 error code.

&rey: Your computer wouldn't represent 123 with seven bits either. It would use data type indicated in the program, which is often 32-bit signed integer. (reply to 115870)

–êro: Here) because there is an established rule. Just don't understand why the documentation doesn't say that. Only ask in chat. Also sir, could you please explain how store_uint works? (reply to 115874)

&rey: store_uint(builder place, i257 value, i257 len) -> (builder, ()):  Take last len bits of value, checking that all bits to the left are zero (i.e. that value is in range [0; 2^len)). Check that builder has space for len more bits. Write taken bits and return new builder. (reply to 115875)

&rey: It's not rule special for FunC, and you should set the Schelling fence somewhere. Otherwise you'd need to write that commands in program are executed in order, and so on. (reply to 115875)

?: Okay, how about a little more simple? I don't understand why this function is needed. So it reads for example 32 bits, then discards the read and outputs without 32 bits of initial bits? (reply to 115879)

&rey: Please check out tutorials for interacting with microcontrollers. Smart contracts are similar to them, except they take use of built-in TON transaction atomicity, and have balance. (reply to 115885)

?: üò≠üò≠thx.. (reply to 115886)

?: But can you explain it easier? I don't have time to deal with controllers... (reply to 115886)

&rey: Not having time is very sad, and very dangerous in blockchain engineering. I must advise you against writing any contracts under time pressure.  ‚Äî‚Äî store_uint ‚Äî‚Äî When program must make use of some integer like 0x0f8a7ea5, it stores the integer on stack. TVM represents that integer as something like 0_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_0f8a7ea5.  When you decide to store integer in builder (b~store_uint(0x0f8a7ea5, 32)), last 32 bits are written, and all others are checked for being zero. [0_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000]_[0f8a7ea5] (first part must be full-zero, second part is stored) (reply to 115888)

?: üôè!!! (reply to 115889)

&rey: TVM debug+implementation detail: its slices are actually only views into cells. See bits at the end of log lines. To get only that slice, you would ~dump(begin_cell().store_slice(...).end_cell().begin_parse()); make sure this code doesn't make it into "production". (reply to 115927)

Oleksandr: Hello, what is forward_ton_amount used for in jetton_wallet?

Zqy: This must be wrong

Zqy: Pop command, shouldn't it be a direct pop-out? Why is it a replacement here?

&rey: That description is correct. What stack modifications do you expect of it? (reply to 115985)

&rey: Stack elements are not shifted with this opcode. See https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.swap_remove for an example of how it works.

Oleksandr: .store_coins(10000000) and how much does that mean (reply to 115983)

&rey: 10_000_000 nanoTON = 0.010 TON. That much is sent to destination contract, to notify about jetton arrival. (reply to 115989)

Oleksandr: thank you, is that the minimal value that can be sent for this purpose? (reply to 115991)

&rey: No. Zero can be passed there for no notification. 1 nanoTON for a useless notification that would only be visible to indexers. (reply to 115992)

Oleksandr: i mean in case the notification is needed, is that possible to pass less? (reply to 115993)

Zqy: Thank you very much for your reply! What I'm trying to say is that there's an ambiguity in the document. It describes "pop s0," which seems to imply that s0 is replacing itself, and thus should remain unchanged. However, in reality, this is equivalent to a drop operation! I believe that clarifying this by stating "pop s0 is equivalent to drop" would make it easier for beginners to understand. (reply to 115988)

&rey: It is indeed swapped with itself, and then last element is dropped. (reply to 115995)

Oleksandr: maybe, there is a minimal value for this? how would it look like here? .store_coins(10000000) thanks (reply to 115994)

&rey: .store_coins(1); no contract is able to handle jetton arrival with such a little amount onchain, but notification will still be there. (reply to 115994)

Oleksandr: could you please suggest the optimal value to set here therefore? (reply to 116002)

&rey: For most use cases, zero. Please detail your use case. (reply to 116003)

Oleksandr: Thank you. I need notification to be sent, contract to be able to handle jetton arrival with that amount, and this amount should be minimal. And I need to know how it should look like in this format  .store_coins(10000000) (reply to 116006)

&rey: Yes. Only such questions are allowed, indeed. (reply to 116105)

Neo: then why you banned my friend? he is trying to learning to code on ton and had a genuine question

Neo: his question in case someone can explain to him. He is asking about Jetton contracts for tokens on TON. Given that tokens on TON are coded in Jetton contracts, if they have no funds, they get frozen and if user doesn't use these tokens for 6 months (doesn't move them in/out) then this contract gets deleted and user loses the tokens right?  he wasn't to understand if the logic is sound or if he is missing something. thanks

Charles More: Glad to be here

Charles More: Please can someone share a complete jetton token contract?, can't seem to find any yet!

fade: the contract might be frozen, but your funds won't be lost, you can unfreeze any contracts using https://unfreezer.ton.org/ (reply to 116109)

Neo: even after the 6 months of frozen window? (reply to 116112)

fade: i dont know, i only read the docs and haven't personally used this tool before, but if funds can be lost then its a big problem that needs more discussion, if you're that worry, just send a few tons to the contract you want to keep alive

Neo: i just watched Oleg's youtube series on TON development and in there he said that contracts get deleted after being frozen for 6 months. hence my concerns. don't have a token in question, just generally want to understand the situation. Since if you hold many tokens, then just have to check for each of them that they are not frozen. (reply to 116114)

fade: from the way i understand it, the contract code and data will be deleted on-chain, but if you have the code and data you can unfreeze (undelete) it, which is what the unfreezer do, it looks for the code and data in an archive (reply to 116115)

&rey: I didn't. Baseless claims, on the other hand, might see users banned.  > He is asking about Jetton contracts for tokens on TON. Given that tokens on TON are coded in Jetton contracts, if they have no funds, they get frozen and if user doesn't use these tokens for 6 months (doesn't move them in/out) then this contract gets deleted and user loses the tokens right?  Those jetton wallets are frozen. To use them, one needs to reactivate them with some TON; they won't be overwritten with zeroes until they reach -1 TON, which is approximately never. (reply to 116107)

Neo: Hmm, the way i understand it is that you can unfreeze it while it is frozen (6months period), after this it gets permanently deleted (reply to 116116)

fade: can you link the docs for that? (reply to 116119)

Neo: Thanks for the explanation, it is relieving to read this.  Btw when i said ‚Äòyou banned him‚Äô i meant one of the mods (reply to 116118)

Neo: Btw is it possible to unban @Dinozaver959 thanks üôè

&rey: It isn't 6 months, it is until contract balance reaches -1 TON (from -0.1 TON where it was frozen). As frozen state is a couple of hashes, that will happen never. (reply to 116119)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: a) use SDK fr you language and fetch list of transactions for your wallet every X seconds b) use tonapi/tonconsole to fetch json list of last transactions for your wallet every X seconds c) use tonapi streaming api and receive notifications, but not stop listening (reply to 116397)

I'm trying to check if wallet contract is deployed and it gives me "false" all the time (but it is deployed and has multiple transactions done already). Here is the code:      const walletMnemonic = "my mnemonic exported from TonKeeper app"     const walletKeyPair = await mnemonicToWalletKey(walletMnemonic.split(" "))     const endpoint = await getHttpEndpoint({ network: "testnet" })     const tonClient = new TonClient({ endpoint })     const wallet = WalletContractV5R1.create({ publicKey: walletKeyPair.publicKey, workchain: 0 })     const isContractDeployed = await tonClient.isContractDeployed(wallet.address)     console.log("isContractDeployed: ", isContractDeployed)     const walletContract = tonClient.open(wallet)  I tried to use WalletContractV5R1 and WalletContractV4 but result is the same.

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: How is last_transaction_id in the return value of /getAddressInformation method calculated?

&rey: Last transaction on that account, known by the server you query. Returned data, code, etc correspond to outcome of that transaction. (reply to 116530)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Hmm. Is it searching through the latest blocks in the blockchain trying to find a block that have this account id included? (reply to 116531)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Roughly speaking

&rey: No. It's looking up current contract state from the "global accounts hashmap" of specific shard. Said state includes unique identifiers for last transaction ‚Äî in particular, time, for storage fee calculation. (reply to 116532)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Makes sense! I guess, it's just a caching technique/an optimization? To store a pointer to a transaction in the account hashmap. The last source of truth is still blocks that have been accepted to the chain? (reply to 116534)

&rey: Validators' signature mainly refers to current blockchain state (its changes are included, but as optimization on network and block size). (reply to 116536)

R: Hello I want to know if there is an rest API to implement the same function of GetAccount in lite-server? it's a pity that args of "/v3/account" contains address no seqno.

Naveen: Send some Toncoin to the calculated address. Note that you need to send them in non-bounce mode since this address has no code yet and thus cannot process incoming messages. non-bounce flag indicates that even if processing fails, money should not be returned with a bounce message. We do not recommend using the non-bounce flag for other transactions, especially when carrying large sums, since the bounce mechanism provides some degree of protection against mistakes. _______________ is this üëÜthe solution ? üòØ   I can get wallet status fromüëá api/v2/getAddressInformation  if its uninitialized i will send the TON in non-bounce mode ?

...: various nft and 0 value tokens were coming to the wallet, i.e. 60,000 dogs worth of bonus and similar nfts were coming and that's it.  as a result, they turned out to be false.  after that $Ton of different value started coming to the wallet from different addresses and immediately sent to 4 5 addresses continuously.  the token received in the wallet will be sent to the same 4 5 addresses within 10 seconds.  the wallet has other $Not $Dogs and some other such tokens, but they can't be tapped because the wallet doesn't have $Tons for commission.  If I put $Ton in the wallet, the situation mentioned above happens.  I searched the shipping addresses and found information about the github site in my wallet, and when I went to it, there was information and codes about the samrt contract.  then when I explained the situation to the support people and asked for help, they said that they could not help and that they might have installed a smart contract on my wallet.

&rey: 1. Create payload for jetton transfer (order) according to TON Cookbook or TEP-74. 2. Obtain sender's jetton wallet address according to TON Cookbook or TEP-74. 3. Send transfer appropriately. Mind fees; try setting forward_amount as low as possible (the best option is zero). (reply to 116994)

Sad Bun üêá: hi!  could someone please clarify, do get methods actually cost gas?  it's said in ton docs that Get methods are special functions in smart contracts that are made for querying specific data from them. Their execution doesn't cost any fees and happens outside of the blockchain. - https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/get-methods  however tonlib's runGetMethod's response contains a field "gasUsed" (and it's not zero)  smc.runResult gas_used:int53 stack:vector<tvm.StackEntry> exit_code:int32 = smc.RunResult; - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/tl/generate/scheme/tonlib_api.tl#L184 smc.runGetMethod id:int53 method:smc.MethodId stack:vector<tvm.StackEntry> = smc.RunResult; - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/tl/generate/scheme/tonlib_api.tl#L315  (i'm mostly interested in standard wallet smart contract and its seqno get method üôèüèª)

Leo: get methods are called off-chain and run in TVM like normal message processing they cost gas in TVM, which is virtual and won't cause any actual balance change on the account

Zqy: How should I submit code optimizations?

&rey: Have you checked whether that'd be more optimal across all contracts? After all, your code will generate SWAP STSLICE in many cases. (reply to 117136)

Zqy: Yep

Zqy: Because a cell is created first, and then the slice is put into it, the Slice is always on the stack in front of the cell.

Shahboz: Hello everyone, has anyone created a jetton using the Mintless Jettons method, and how much commission would it take to distribute the jetton to 10,000 addresses?

&rey: You can't wait until transaction tree produced by first message completes. The second message might be sent, and will arrive later than the first if destination contract is same. (reply to 117191)

Mirheydar: Hi  Which one of these contracts are more recommended to use?  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter-contract/blob/main/contracts/jetton-minter.fc https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-minter-discoverable.fc

Grimmie: I have a quick question. From mempool sse, I subscribe for real time account notification

Grimmie: but it says the response data is "boc"

Grimmie: may I know how i can get transaction hash from boc and parse it using getEvent/getTransaction api?

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: it's /emulation/decode or something like that (reply to 117247)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: mempool is about external messages to the blockchain that will later result in transactions, there's no direct way to get a transaction hash out of a mempool event

Grimmie: that's interesting. from other EVM chains, I used to get the transaction hash from mempool as well üò≥ (reply to 117250)

Grimmie: so i can decode boc message instead of getting transaction hash? (reply to 117249)

Grimmie: ok then i will try to do it

Grimmie: yo @nogitsunesmirnova i have another quick question. when i parse confirmed tx, i get different address from this tx: https://tonscan.org/tx/fe4d12124d39fbf9f16de54981fc55a6a8d7ea441cf413f01adc84c558f45947#overview  i see that sender is UQBm1xC2oXVHhHAxlbRBLRV80NeI3gi5gddH_VUchTb2IIyt but the response says EQBm1xC2oXVHhHAxlbRBLRV80NeI3gi5gddH_VUchTb2INFo

&rey: But this is totally non-EVM chain!) Here, once you get transaction hash [and verify it], it is already final. (reply to 117251)

Grimmie: Got it üëç (reply to 117265)

&rey: those are same (reply to 117264)

Grimmie: ??? (reply to 117267)

Grimmie: it has different characters

Grimmie: if I compare these two strings, it returns false, right? maybe, is there a way to convert one to make it same as another?

&rey: You should convert them to raw addresses; what programming language would you like? (reply to 117272)

Grimmie: I am using typescript

Grimmie: ofc, I can convert it to raw address, but wasn't able to get the friendly addresss back (reply to 117273)

Grimmie: ahh ok got it

&rey: Address.parse('...').toRawString() (reply to 117274)

Grimmie: so for my applications, i don't need to use friendly addresses to store in db

Grimmie: hmm maybe store both friendly and raw addresses :(

&rey: as for what flags to use for friendly address: depends on purpose

&rey: Do you want to ‚Äî [ ] a. send TON there ‚Äî [ ] b. send other rewards there / receive any assets from there ‚Äî [ ] c. show the address in app?

Grimmie: mostly c.

&rey: You should use tonapi's backresolve; it will show nice domain if user has one. (reply to 117282)

Grimmie: awesome. i will consider the domain later

Grimmie: for now, I need to get the original friendly address that users use

&rey: people are getting used to UQ... address (non-bounceable)

Grimmie: so what i need is, from the response address: EQBm1xC2oXVHhHAxlbRBLRV80NeI3gi5gddH_VUchTb2INFo  i need to get the original address: UQBm1xC2oXVHhHAxlbRBLRV80NeI3gi5gddH_VUchTb2IIyt

Grimmie: is it possible?

&rey: Address.parse('...').toString({bounceable: false}) (reply to 117287)

Grimmie: Awesome, thank you. I will try it and let you know (reply to 117291)

When I call it via api v2, or v3 it's parsing properly. anyone knows why the sdk.js is not parsing properly?  This is what i am getting on client.runMethod

Barbell:  TupleReader {   items: [     [       x{80104B94273ED855F189171667F17A220BE45BE0DF3A00099EA98FEDE7B8034E593_},       1n,       2n,       100000000n     ],

Valentin: What are interfaces? Is that a field sored in the contract storage? (reply to 117515)

&rey: No. TVM has no notion of interfaces at all; explorers partially parse contract code to check if it has certain get-methods, and so label the contract.  In particular, there is jetton_master,jetton_wallet; in fact, that contract does work as both. (reply to 117587)

Valentin: I'm trying to identify if a contract has malicious code or is a scam.  For that I want to:  1. Check if the admin is the zero address (otherwise it's a red flag) 2. Check if the code has some malicious functions.  Do you have any tips for this? (reply to 117588)

&rey: Not possible in any reasonable time due to complexity theory limits for computation. (reply to 117589)

Valentin: 1 or 2? (reply to 117590)

Valentin: For (1) is there a function I can call to get the admin address?  For (2) I plan on diffing the default jetton contract code with the actual code and see if there are new functions (reply to 117590)

&rey: What says that returned admin address means anything to the contract? So, I'm talking about both points.  You should pass the judgement onto someone else. Probably user; if they get unsolicited token, that's suspicious, etc.

Andreas: So my deploy transactions are charging ton on mainnet and then fail to deploy.

Andreas: I asked in the TON Community channel and I am now getting a bunch of people trying to "help", hmmm.

&rey: you shouldn't reuse same mnemonic, as signatures are valid across both networks (there is no fundamental difference between testnet and mainnet which would prevent that) (reply to 117917)

Andreas: The problem is more functional. The click of the button just closes the window, but doesn't ask for a mnemonic or switch to testnet üòû

&rey: I'd suggest contacting Tonkeeper support (presumably there are contacts on their site) or using another wallet application. Or using @ton/sandbox for initial testing.

Joe: Hi. Is it possible to simulate transaction on ton at the specific block using api/rpc? I see that get methods run through simulation, but is it possible to check that on external message?

&rey: Transactions without user authorization are not possible. Asking for ways to implement them in any other fashion will lead to permanent ban. (reply to 118288)

Nerses: yeah. the strange is when i use other testnet wallet the problem doesnt occur

&rey: You couldn't have obtained that address from wallet.address.toString(). (reply to 118317)

&rey: Wallet you're sending is v5r1, and you're attempting to access wallet with (same?) keypair but v4r2.

Nerses: I use this code   const endpoint = await getHttpEndpoint({ network: "testnet" });   const client = new TonClient({ endpoint });    const mnemonic =    const key = await mnemonicToWalletKey(mnemonic.split(" "));   const wallet = WalletContractV4.create({ publicKey: key.publicKey, workchain: 0 });   if (!await client.isContractDeployed(wallet.address)) {     return console.log("Wallet is not deployed");   }   So i know mnemonic of my wallet thats why I could specify address (reply to 118321)

Nerses: does TonClient supports wallets of that version ? (reply to 118322)

Thanh Phong: Hi everyone

pursue: Can anyone resolve it? npm run build, Error

peacyy: Good afternoon!!!  We are looking for talented developers who have extensive experience with FunC and Fift to write fault-tolerant and scalable smart contracts.  We would be happy to see you in our team and build a long-term working relationship.

Nguy·ªÖn: Someone can tell me the common way to debug in FunC , I have search in the internet and got a result :

Aleks: Hey all. What‚Äôs the easiest way to identify the version of a wallet? Any standardized get method on wallets we can call to get the version or do we have to compared the hashed code to known wallets code? What nodejs sdk provider a way to do this?

&rey: You should compare code, because versions are universally adopted postfactum. (E.g. my wallet-inplug-v2 could've been the wallet-v5.) (reply to 118691)

Aleks: Thanks!  What about /getWalletInformation from Toncenter V2.  It gives a string like so: wallet_type: 'wallet v5 r1‚Äô  Not reliable? (reply to 118692)

&rey: It is based on code hash comparison as well, just that Toncenter internally translates it according to their knowledge. Those labels are not standard, so you shouldn't base app logic on them. (reply to 118693)

Aleks: Gotcha. Thanks a bunch! (reply to 118695)

&rey: However, I don't understand what you're trying to do. Presumably you want to validate that wallet supports "gasless" payments? (reply to 118696)

Aleks: I simply want to have users pay for contract interactions. For example we are minting Sbts and in our logic the Sender is our wallet. So we pay the gas fees ourselves. We want to offload that payment to the users. Maybe there is a more straghtforward way to do this (reply to 118697)

&rey: You need to rework collection so that users are minting items (with permit expressed in form of signature from your backend), and request user to mint via either TC2 or even simple https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer links. (reply to 118698)

Aleks: Right I see. We deploy single Item sbts, so not attached to any collection. (reply to 118699)

&rey: Even easier then. wait, but how should others verify that a given SBT is deployed from your service? (reply to 118700)

Aleks: So we have to build a transaction and simply wire it to them so that they can sign it? (reply to 118701)

&rey: Yes. Usually both of those steps are done at frontend. (reply to 118702)

Aleks: Ah right. So with UI. It‚Äôs happening in the backend for us.. FE only does the wallet connection (reply to 118702)

Aleks: Should be doable in the BE as well I suppose‚Ä¶ just have to figure out how to pass a tx back to the UI for the users to sign (reply to 118706)

–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π: Hi guys. I can successfully connect tonkeeper but with tg wallet - getting error related to manifest file. Is there any specific requirement for TG wallet manifest content?

Zqy: Hello (reply to 118673)

Self Empire: Please revert me any Admin

Self Empire: I have suffered a loss of Rs. 62 on your website, when I went to claim it you made my funds disappear

Self Empire: 62 usdt

Self Empire: Kindly reverse my payment

&rey: Presumably you have visited some unofficial site and confirmed the transaction of loss. Transactions in TON are not reversible.  Please note the official site of TON is https://ton.org (no "tg" or anything like that; Telegram and TON are even very separate entities!). (reply to 118725)

Tom: Hey guys, do you suggest any method to detect different versions of Jettons? The one in the official repository and the one from stable contract. They have different assumption of gas fee. One requires much more than the other. Any way to detect rather than simulation of transactions to see which one fails?

&rey: Unfortunately there's no way to do so. Though, with modified TVM (re: symbolic execution) you can find out fee in one run. (reply to 118730)

Tom: Thanks for the hint. (reply to 118732)

TON Bounty Bridge: ‚ÄãFunding Education and DeFi Empowerment in Brazil with TON  üè∑ Education  Created by danimim

Tom: Should be more complicated than needed so the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù way I think could be sticking with a higher assumption of gas usage and build a whitelist for lower gas jettons. The simulation is costly tho so we couldnt try to simulate in runtime. (reply to 118732)

battle: I am a highly skilled Ton dev with extensive experience in TON chain development, specializing in smart contracts, NFTs and tg bots, tg mini-app development (e.g. tap games). In general, infinite data structures that can scale to billions of elements are very difficult to implement on blockchains. However, TON chain makes it possible by splitting data across multiple smart contracts. That's why I am interested in TON chain and familiar with Func and tact languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor developing smart contracts. On the front-end side, I have skillfully implemented the integration of smart contracts and front-end using Ton Connect SDK. Looking forward to the opportunity to work with you.

David: Hi guys, is there a way to check onchain if a contract is already deployed on certain address? like if .code is empty?

Akun Terhapus: Hello,  I am looking for a service provider who can create a Python script that generates multiple USDT wallets on the TON network. Additionally, I need the script to transfer USDT from these newly created wallets to a single wallet. If possible, I would also like the transfer fees to be in USDT.  Before making any payments, I would like to receive a trial version of the script to ensure it meets my requirements.  Please let me know if you have the expertise to assist with this project and provide any relevant details about your services.  dm me @MrMajorExe

musashi: my main issue is to read the state from many user contracts then we can apply the ramdom method in this docs (reply to 119039)

‚Äî 2024-10-29 ‚Äî

Xin Jin (NT Capital): Hi, whats the regexp to control TON wallet some starts with UQ or EQ üôè

Haint: dictionaries in TON can only hold up to 32k entries, so depends on your user count, it might not be viable. what you should do is to have a backend server that constantly monitors the main contract for user deposits. You can perform the random on the BE as well since you have all the data, and then later upload it to the contract. (reply to 119107)

musashi: how to make the backend listen to deposit events while we don't have that 'events' on TON mate? (reply to 119118)

Haint: oh, there are multiple ways (reply to 119119)

Haint: you can certainly emulate "event" on ton

musashi: ok, even that's possible I think it's quite centralized and could be failed if my backend get trouble

TKAINU: Please help me (reply to 119088)

Haint: well, if you are sure that your user count wont exceed the dictionary caps then it is a viable option (reply to 119122)

S: not sure why I am getting "unable to execute get method, exit code: 9" error while running test script

S: It's a counter contract which counts contract calls

&rey: Did you set initial data cell to contain 64 bits?  Also, you've skipped reading/storing much of message flags, which leads to errors when processing the internal. Remember that cells are nothing other than bit and ref sequences (in particular, no types for contents), and all preceding data has to be read/skipped. (reply to 119304)

S: right, I needed to initially configure the cell to be 64 bit data. thanks (reply to 119306)

S: can you kindly elaborate it more in terms of message flags?

&rey: cs~load_uint(4) is missing here in between. (reply to 119303)

&rey: As for storing message: first you should determine how much balance should the counter have. 0 TON is a sensible choice if it is used often, as contracts are only frozen on -0.1 TON.

Alex: Hi guys. From the article from docs ton "how to calculate users jetton", there is a method how we can calculate jetton address offline, like this.   const jettonWalletStateInit = beginCell().store(storeStateInit({     code: JETTON_WALLET_CODE,     data: beginCell()         .storeCoins(0)         .storeAddress(USER_ADDRESS)         .storeAddress(JETTON_MASTER_ADDRESS)         .storeRef(JETTON_WALLET_CODE)         .endCell() })) .endCell(); But, also there is the next info:   Most major tokens do not have a different storage structure because they use a standard implementation of the TEP-74 standard. The exception is the new Jetton-with-governance contracts for centralized stablecoins. In these, the difference is the presence of a wallet status field and the absence of a code cell in the vault. Does anybody know how I can determine whether it " Jetton-with-governance contracts for centralized stablecoins." or not from the code perspective?

&rey: Generally, if you face such a question (handling arbitrary jettons), you should assume you know nothing about their structure except TEP-74's interface.  (In particular, you should not assume jetton master is distinct from jetton wallet; just call get-method to know.) (reply to 119324)

Alex: I don't follow. Could you elaborate more?  Right now I'm facing the problem that I cannot calculate user's jetton address because Dogs coin is seems to be of that new "jetton with governance" type (reply to 119326)

&rey: Use the option which calls get-method, it works anyway. Adjacent section in docs. (reply to 119327)

Alex: So there's no option for calculating this offline? I just like the idea when I don't need to call additional endpoints (reply to 119328)

&rey: If you use specific jetton, you can look at its source code and move it into your script, storing all cells like jetton wallet code as Cell.fromBase64('te6cck...') also. (reply to 119329)

Alex: ok, got it. Thanks a lot mate (reply to 119330)

Fic2: Hello

Fic2: Hi, I am currently facing some issue and I would like some help : I have a mnemonic phrase, that I generated with MyTonWallet, and my goal is to retrieve the corresponding public ton address. Here is why I have understood so far :  - a wallet is a smart contract, and it has an intial state  - to compute the address, we first have to derive an eddsa public key from the mnemonic  - then, we have to Àãhash` (not sure of this one) the smart contract code (in my case, my wallet is v5r1) into some ÀãbyteRes` -then, ÀãpubTonAddress=EQ+hash(hash(eddsa), bytesRes)`  I tried to do it, but I am not able to retrieve the correct public key  Can someone help me connect the missing dots? Is there some documentation that can be helpful for me?

&rey: The structure is similar but specifics are like all wrong: ‚Äî address from hash part: https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/addresses#user-friendly-address ‚Äî hash part: representation hash of StateInit cell: beginCell().storeUint(6, 5).storeRef(code).storeRef(data).endCell().hash() ‚Äî data: depends on wallet version very much, contains public key ‚Äî public key: just Ed25519, from keypair ‚Äî keypair: generated using TON's algorithm (a few thousand HMAC iterations) from mnemonic  You should check out vanity-contract-s for calculations sped up and all in one place.

S: like jetton minter is parent of every jetton wallet

S: I can't find any clue that it sends message to jetton wallet in send_to_jetton_wallet function

S: I mean, generating wallet address(if not exist) and sending raw message will deploy a new subcontract of wallet?

&rey: Like that: note that message contains StateInit. (reply to 119432)

S: how do we know that message is aimed to wallet, not other contract or minter itself?

&rey: By destination address, presumably? Remember that contract address is deterministically derived from StateInit. (reply to 119434)

S: right, that's clear when that certain wallet already exists. I am referring to the case when we need to create a new wallet and send message. (reply to 119439)

&rey: Nothing changes. Address is hash of StateInit. Nothing another can be deployed at that place. (reply to 119440)

S: how do we make sure the new wallet contract will handle that first message, but not other contract? (reply to 119441)

&rey: Well,     slice to_wallet_address = calculate_jetton_wallet_address(state_init); handles that doesn't it? (reply to 119442)

&rey: (I recommend against copying any code from TON's implementation of tokens, due to absence of any license which would allow you to do so, and due to abundance of bad practices. Ideas are right, though.)

S: it only calculates(generate) address of an existing(new) wallet. which doesn't contain complicated send, receive functions etc of wallet contract. are not desired. that makes me dumb. (reply to 119443)

S: so I can't be sure it's for deploying new wallet contract

&rey: There's no difference between existing and new "sub"contracts; you still need to know their StateInit for deploy and deploy+interaction, and that allows to determine the single address contract resides at.  StateInit-s are unique <=> contracts are distinct. Just include user's address in the former. (reply to 119445)

S: ok, let's say I have jetton minter and 2 contracts who are potential candidates for sub-contract.(wallet1 and wallet2). user has sent message to a non-existing addr so we need to deploy a new sub-contract and forward that message. Here we generate a new addr and choose wallet. Hope you got what I am confused with. üôè (reply to 119447)

&rey: You're approaching this wrong: there are no "wallet1" and "wallet2". In particular, master contract does not store any "sub"contract address. (reply to 119449)

S: I mean

S: let's say I wrote 2 potential subcontracts jettonwallet and dumbwallet

&rey: Nope you haven't. It does not work so.

S: 2 seperate code, seperate fc files

&rey: Such a system is possible to write but unfair and therefore not explored.

S: so TON one dApp can only have up to 2 contracts?

S: not dapp

&rey: More contracts you make in a system, the more error-prone it is, and the less user trust you have. Deservedly.

S: that's true. here another case has just come up with me, when we generate a new addr, it might deploy not the wallet but minter itself, no? new minter contract (reply to 119459)

&rey: I don't think code doing so makes any sense. After all, blockchain doesn't choose what to deploy, it just checks that provided address matches code+data pair. (reply to 119460)

S: ah

S: what if parent contract and child contract have same cell structure?

Haint: I think you are very confused (reply to 119457)

Haint: contract address is derived from stateinit, which consists of 2 cells: 1 for contract code and 1 for initial data. If both of those are the same, then it's not "parent contract" and "child contract" anymore, it's just one contract. (reply to 119463)

S: then don't we fall in the curse of infinite loop? subcontract should contain stateinit info in its cell, which again stateinit contains? would appreciate if you can elaborate it more (reply to 119465)

Haint: subcontract code is likely different from the parent contract (reply to 119466)

S: right

Haint: so the stateinit wont be the same anymore

S: but shouldn't be  the cell structure of message sent to the subcontract and subcontract's cell structure same?

Ratul: I am new so... the obvious question the best place to earn ton

&rey: 1. Remember that in ~100% DMs are scam. 2. Contests ran by TON. 3. Jobs @tonhunt, probably small ones for starters. (reply to 119471)

&rey: Otherwise, off topic.

Ratul: OK am trying this one out

Haint: i dont know if I understand your question correctly...but yes the structure for the stateinit's data cell should be the same as how you store it in the subcontract. (reply to 119470)

Tom: Same structure is not the same content. (reply to 119470)

Tom: If you come from EVM background, you might find the same concept with CREATE2

Tom: It‚Äôs deterministic

Could someone advise me on what I need to get to build this kind of website? Preferably, I‚Äôd like to do it through FunC or Tact. Could anyone recommend any videos to watch to help me with this?

If i add the same functional but wont use librarian its working good, but using librarian its failing. Is there a problem with library code or maybe i have to put some ton on library balance or so? I was not able to find a lot of info about library so maybe someone here will help

After that, you choose the wallet to send from, and that's it.  I am using js, Ton connect is connected with CDN

BizX: hi, let's discuss about this project (reply to 119367)

S: is address of a contract represented differently in FunC and TS when I log them?

Alberto: Gm

Alberto: Is there an endpoint that returns the following for transactions being made by an address? {   "txId": "transaction-id",   "from": "sender-address",   "to": "receiver-address",   "value": "transaction-value",   "token": "token-type",   "memo": "transaction-memo",   "success": "transaction-status",   "tx": "complete-transaction-object" }

Alberto: Or multiple endpoints to return that?

&rey: Look at tonapi. Please remember that TON transactions have different meaning than Eth's ones. (reply to 119573)

&rey: There are special wallet versions ("restricted") which limit possible transfer destinations.  Though, TON is safer than EVM by default; assets can only be sent from common wallets (as a result of first transaction in transactions tree), not pulled by any subsequent messages. (reply to 119530)

&rey: You don't need to use TON Connect 2 then; you can simply show QR/open link of kind https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/<destination>?amount=<a>&bin=<b>&init=<i>. (reply to 119561)

&rey: No you don't. In fact, jetton transfer may even not touch the wallet contract. (reply to 119548)

S: hey guys i am back

S: () recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {   int opcode = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);   throw_unless(error:wrong_op, opcode == op::click);    var cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();   cs~load_uint(4);   slice sender_addr = cs~load_msg_addr();    int hashed_sender_addr = slice_hash(sender_addr);    (int count, cell dic) = load_data();    ~dump(sender_addr);   ~dump(hashed_sender_addr);   (slice x, int key?) = udict_get?(dic, 256, hashed_sender_addr);   ~dump(key?);    count += 1;   save_data(count, dic);   return();  }

S: here the console only logs until hashed_sender_addr

S: which makes me think there's a problem in dictionary check

S: how do you usually set the initial value of a dictionary when you deploy a contract

S: (int, cell) load_data() inline {   slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();   int count = ds~load_uint(64);   cell dic_data = ds~load_ref();   cell dic = dic_data.begin_parse().slice_bits() == 0 ? new_dict() : dic_data;   ;; cell dic = new_dict();   ds.end_parse();   return (count, dic); }

S: here, I just set the dummy initial dict as contract's compiled code itself

S: () save_data(int count, cell dic) impure inline {   set_data(     begin_cell()     .store_uint(count, 64)     .store_ref(dic)     .end_cell()   ); }  here can't I store empty dictionary as reference?

S: when I deploy a contract, can I initialize the value of a cell as empty dictionary?

S: I got stuck with handling dictionary

S: cell dic = dic_data.begin_parse().slice_bits() == 0 ? new_dict() : dic_data;  why do you think dic_data.begin_parse().slice_bits() is always 0 even though I have added a value before

S: cell dic_data = ds~load_ref();   cell dic = dic_data.begin_parse().slice_bits() == 0 ? new_dict() : dic_data;  here dic_data itself is not an empty cell

Dmitriy: you should check for references as well use slice_bits_refs for it IIRC the root cell of dictionary is empty since it stores the elements in separate cells (reply to 119669)

Dmitriy: but the best choice is to use cell_null? function that checks dict for emptiness

S: contract  = blockchain.openContract(Clicker.createFromConfig({ admin: deployer.address, dic: new Cell() }, code));

S: so initially I deploy it with new Cell()

S: and the first transaction(message) is to add a value to the dict

S: doesn't it always give -1(true) in my case? (reply to 119673)

S: if cell is not a valid dictionary, further methods like udict_get? fail so I need to init it as new_dict() from the very start.

S: @pcrafter

Dmitriy: you don‚Äôt need new_dict for it  just use    dic: beginCell().storeDict(null).endCell()   in your TypeScript wrapper during deployment and use   ds~load_dict();   in your FunC code when retreiving a storage via get_data and everything will work (reply to 119682)

Dmitriy: if I got your problem right and you need to initialize the contract with empty dict in the storage

S: oh thank you. (reply to 119687)

S: btw, still I shall store it as ref?

S: you know, dic's type is Cell

Dmitriy: yes, dict is a separate cell that needs to be stored as a reference storeDict does it under the hood you can also use storeRef(beginCell().newCell()) but storeDict is more idiomatic

S: then, I suppose I would need to use load_ref as well

Dmitriy: load_dict() does it under the hood as well :)

Dmitriy: no extra manipulations are needed apart from this (reply to 119686)

S: it fails to load dict. :(  export function clickerConfigToCell(config: ClickerConfig): Cell {     return beginCell().storeUint(0, 64).storeAddress(config.admin).storeRef(config.dic).endCell(); }          clicker = blockchain.openContract(             Clicker.createFromConfig({ admin: deployer.address, dic: beginCell().storeDict(null).endCell() }, code),         );  (int, slice, cell) load_data() inline {   slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();   int count = ds~load_uint(64);   slice amdin_addr = ds~load_msg_addr();   cell dic_data = ds~load_dict();   ~dump(dic_data);   cell dic = dict_empty?(dic_data) == -1 ? new_dict() : dic_data;   ds.end_parse();   return (count, amdin_addr, dic_data); }

S: it fails to log dic_data, which means the previous code of load_dict() didn't work.

Dmitriy: What is config.dic here? (reply to 119700)

S: export type ClickerConfig = {     admin: Address;     dic: Cell; };  here (reply to 119702)

S: If I use load_ref then     (slice x , int key?) = udict_get?(dic, 256, hashed_user_addr); fails

&rey: So do you call load_data at all? Do other logs work? (reply to 119701)

S: if (opcode = op::add) {     ~dump(op::add);     throw_unless(error:not_admin, sender_addr.slice_bits() == admin_addr.slice_bits());     slice user_addr = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();     int hashed_user_addr = slice_hash(user_addr);     ~dump(hashed_user_addr);          (slice x , int key?) = udict_get?(dic, 256, hashed_user_addr);     ~dump(key?);     ~dump(dic);     (dic, int success?) = udict_add?(dic, 256, hashed_user_addr, begin_cell().end_cell().begin_parse());     ~dump(dic);     ~dump(success?);     (slice y , int _key?) = udict_get?(dic, 256, hashed_user_addr);     ~dump(_key?);     save_data(count, admin_addr, dic);     (count, admin_addr, dic) = load_data();     (x , int _key_?) = udict_get?(dic, 256, hashed_user_addr);     ~dump(_key_?);   }  in this code sir, if I go from new_dict() then it works until the end

S: but although I set the initial value of dic as empty cell in the deployment phase like below  clicker = blockchain.openContract(             Clicker.createFromConfig({ admin: deployer.address, dic: beginCell().storeDict(null).endCell() }, code),         );

S: cell dic = cell_null?(dic_data) == -1 ? new_dict() : dic_data;   cell dic = dict_empty?(dic_data) == -1 ? new_dict() : dic_data;   cell dic = dic_data.begin_parse().slice_bits() == 0 ? new_dict() : dic_data;  if I try to load it using one of these 3 ways, it appears not to be empty dic

S: C{90AEC8965AFABB16EBC3CB9B408EBAE71B618D78788BC80D09843593CAC98DA4} this is the log of the dic. It was supposed to be (), which is new_dict()

S: shall I share the code on github so that it has better look?

S: (int, slice, cell) load_data() inline {   slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();   int count = ds~load_uint(64);   slice amdin_addr = ds~load_msg_addr();   cell dic_data = ds~load_ref();   cell dic = cell_null?(dic_data) == -1 ? new_dict() : dic_data;   cell dic = dict_empty?(dic_data) == -1 ? new_dict() : dic_data;   cell dic = dic_data.begin_parse().slice_bits() == 0 ? new_dict() : dic_data;   ;; cell dic = new_dict();   ds.end_parse();   return (count, amdin_addr, dic); }  this is the load function actually (reply to 119727)

S: you know, I can't init the dic everytime load_data is called and just first initialization suffices

S: I am stuck with that

&rey: Which part ‚Äî keyPairFromMnemonic or contract (and its address) from keypair? (reply to 119789)

Giorgi: In EVM ecosystem I would have a private key of the wallet and then with manipulation with paths I could derive unlimited amount of wallets deterministically is there anything similar here ?

Leo: mnemonic  ==hmac==>  seed  ==pbkdf==>  privkey  ==ed25519==>  pubkey  ==buildcell==>  stateinit  ==hash==>  walletaddr

&rey: 1. Ed25519 keys. If you find a compatible HD scheme, you can get however many keypairs. 2. Wallet IDs. You can change those, to have multiple wallets with single keypair. (reply to 119791)

Leo: If you use BIP32-like approach instead of the standard TON wallet approach, you can get countless secret keys for wallets. (reply to 119791)

Leo: use the registered TON path 44'/607'/ just like tr_ust_wal_let does

Giorgi: Okay, that makes sense, thanks both of you for such good explanations!

JT: One private = one pubkey. There wont be any EOA as EVM on TON. Instead, TON has smart wallet. Am I right?

&rey: Your message carefully skips that 1. one seed ‚Äî> multiple possible keypairs, 2. one keypair ‚Äî> multiple possible wallets. Thus, it is right but inconsequential. (reply to 119802)

JT: One mnemonic seed can generate many private keys. These concept pretty much the same as Bitcoin account

JT: The question he asked is EOA which in fact not existed in TON

JT: One privkey = one pubkey

JT: One EOA in EVM could also have a countless smart contract wallet

Leo: Well, since he said that he can use "private key" to "derive unlimited wallets" in EVM and asked whether he can do the same thing on TON, probably he confused private key with mnemonic and was asking if there's similar HD approach on TON, instead of the EOA thing.

WhyesCode: Hi, it's good to be here.

Ksms: Hello, I perform multiple test transactions and I notice the storageFeesDue keep accumulating. At what point is the DuePayment paid?

MZ: Is it possible it has been returned, because I haven't sent any transactions from this wallet yet? (reply to 119850)

MZ: This is how I send transaction. (reply to 119850)

WhyesCode: Possibly! Some wallets require an initial transaction to be properly set up. Your code looks good. You might want to send a small transaction first to "initialize" the wallet. This could resolve the auto-return issue.

MZ: What does it mean? Is it possible that it returned that amount, because my wallet wasn‚Äôt activated (didn‚Äôt have any sent transactions)? (reply to 119856)

Ursss_ysn: /stat@combot

WhyesCode: Yes! It is possible. (reply to 119878)

WhyesCode: You can use the API to query the balance of an address on a specific date and track changes in the balance up to a certain time. (reply to 119878)

WhyesCode: You'll need to make HTTP requests to the TON HTTP API to fetch the required data.

Ihor: Thanks allot  I just wondered which method I should call?  Or maybe I need to combine for several calls with different methods? (reply to 119884)

WhyesCode: You'll likely need to make several calls to different methods. Use getAccountState to get the balance of an address. (reply to 119886)

S: I think I am not providing the child contract's code properly, which will be used for state_init, when I deploy the parent contract           trackerCodeRaw = await compile('Tracker');         const _libs = Dictionary.empty(Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256), Dictionary.Values.Cell());         _libs.set(BigInt(0x${trackerCodeRaw.hash().toString('hex')}), trackerCodeRaw);         const libs = beginCell().storeDictDirect(_libs).endCell();         blockchain.libs = libs;         let lib_prep = beginCell().storeUint(2, 8).storeBuffer(trackerCodeRaw.hash()).endCell();         trackerCode = new Cell({ exotic: true, bits: lib_prep.bits, refs: lib_prep.refs });          clicker = blockchain.openContract(Clicker.createFromConfig({ trackerCode: trackerCode, dic: null }, code));

S: here I used sample code from jetton

‚Äî 2024-11-01 ‚Äî

S: right

S: await clicker.sendClick(deployer.getSender(), toNano('1'), 1);  actually this function is supposed to deploy the child contract with state_init code on parent contract

S: var msg_to_tracker =        begin_cell()       .store_uint(0x18, 6)       .store_slice(tracker_addr)       .store_uint(4 + 2 + 1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1)       .store_ref(state_init)       .store_ref(msg_body_to_tracker);  send_raw_message(msg_to_tracker.end_cell(), 1);

S: I think it doesn't though  I tried to log a dummy value in the child contract code and it didn't, which means this message failed

Haint: print out the transactions to see what's wrong with it tips: use flattenTransaction from @ton/test-utils to make it more readable (reply to 120009)

S: it passed until the child contract (reply to 120019)

S: but I still get "trying to ... on non-active contract" error

Haint: read carefully what i said (reply to 120020)

Haint: printing out transaction result would show you the state of the contract (child contract state should be active)

S: ah, deploying doesn;t mean it's active? (reply to 120024)

S: sorry I was asking

Haint: there might be problem when deploying (reply to 120025)

Haint: in that case, the contract state remains uninitialized

S: https://github.com/Azymack/clicker_/blob/master/contracts/clicker.fc

S: maybe the line 69 is the relevant part

Haint: instead of speculating, why not just do what I adviced? You'll see where the problem is.

Haint: learn to debug the code

S: sorry I am new (reply to 120034)

S: all I do for debugging is dump and console

S: btw all the actionResultCodes are 0 and they are all successful

Haint: your unit test is not even a test...all the assertions are commented. No wonder it all passed.

S: no I mean transaction (reply to 120039)

S: damn bot

S: https://github.com/Azymack/clicker_/blob/master/tests/Clicker.spec.ts line 73 gives me error, which gets data from child contract

S: but actually it's deployed by the parent contract when I trigger click operation https://github.com/Azymack/clicker_/blob/master/tests/Clicker.spec.ts line 62

Haint: you need to first make sure the tracker contract is deployed before calling get method on it.  expect(res.transactions).toHaveTransaction({             from: clicker.address,              to: deployerTracker.address,             deploy: true,             success: true,          }); (reply to 120045)

Haint: I dont think this would pass

Haint: that's why I told you to use flattenTransaction to print out the res.transactions, so you'll have some ideas whats going wrong

S: running forloop? (reply to 120050)

Haint: Use whatever. It's just javascript. (reply to 120051)

S: right it's deployed to different address not sure why (reply to 120055)

chung üÜô UXUY: help me 1 transaction error. I transferred my not coin on Telegram wallet but have not received it.

S: one child contract is deployed but its address is not what I expected. why do you think this would happen though I used same function (reply to 120047)

Haint: it means the stateinit is not the same (reply to 120059)

S: sorry what do you mean? I calculate it once (reply to 120060)

S: between what and what (reply to 120060)

S: here I log my_address() twice but the values are different. Isn't it of a same smart contract?

S: hey Haint (reply to 120060)

S: what's the timeframe of this slowmode?

S: I am encountering an inconsistency when calling my_address() in different contexts in the same contract

S: When I call my_address() within get function, it returns a slice that starts with 0 bits

S: when I call my_address() within an impure function, it returns a slice that starts with 1 bit

S: hey friend any idea with my issue? (reply to 120083)

PuzzledOldman: Try reloading, yesterday I had the same and reloading helped quickly

Sigit H. Yudanto: Already did that mate

Kyle: Hi I want to generate proof using ton wallet to verify in my backend. I'm following the tutorial in ton doc website. But when I connect my extension wallet, I don't have state_init field in proof so I cannot verify in my backend. So what am I missing? Please help me

PuzzledOldman: Someone could just do a TON wallet in C++ alike  –° is probably doable on Android with rawdrawandroid lib (reply to 120106)

Champer Wu: use TONX API to get jetton transfer is more easily  https://docs.tonxapi.com/reference/get-jetton-wallets https://docs.tonxapi.com/reference/get-jetton-transfers use this two api could handle histories all you needs (reply to 119878)

S: I am encountering an inconsistency when calling my_address() in different contexts in the same contract  When I call my_address() within get function, it returns a slice that starts with 0 bits  when I call my_address() within an impure function, it returns a slice that starts with 1 bit

S: Is this possible to happen in the same smart contract?

S: oh you don't sleep yet

S: so I have read the transactions

S: I have triggered same operation twice and the messages from the parent contract are sent to same address.

S: const _libs = Dictionary.empty(Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256), Dictionary.Values.Cell());         _libs.set(BigInt(0x${trackerCodeRaw.hash().toString('hex')}), trackerCodeRaw);         const libs = beginCell().storeDictDirect(_libs).endCell();         blockchain.libs = libs;         let lib_prep = beginCell().storeUint(2, 8).storeBuffer(trackerCodeRaw.hash()).endCell();         trackerCode = new Cell({ exotic: true, bits: lib_prep.bits, refs: lib_prep.refs });          clicker = blockchain.openContract(             Clicker.createFromConfig({ trackerCode: trackerCode, dic: null }, clickerCode),         );

S: perhaps this is wrong? It's used to get tracker contract's code from raw compiled code. I just copy pasted jetton's

S: thanks

Umaid: Basically I was stuck for a week on this.ü•∫ (reply to 120161)

&rey: Since something needs to sign the message, tonapi/toncenter cannot do the transfer themselves, but you'll need one as part of script. (reply to 120161)

Umaid: Can you share the script please (reply to 120164)

Umaid: It will be helpful for me

S: Everyone, pls be careful with using . and ~

S: cell msg_body_to_clicker =      begin_cell()     .store_uint(op::response, 32)     .store_uint(status_code, 64)     .store_uint(new_vote_id, 128)     .store_uint(vote_id, 256)     .store_slice(user_addr)     .end_cell();   var msg =      begin_cell()     .store_uint(0x18, 6)     .store_slice(clicker_addr)     .store_coins(msg_value)     .store_uint(1, 107)     .store_ref(msg_body_to_clicker);      ;; send message back to the clicker   send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), 1);  this is the message I try to send back from the child contract to the parent contract but it fails with actionResult 34 code

S: here store_uint(1, 107) have specific meaning?

S: the send mode was the problem

S: btw, when I try to load the data on the parent contract op::response was supposed to  be read but I get different value

S: int opcode = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);  If I load the first uint_32 data from the message body. op::response is not read?

S: .store_uint(op::response, 32) (reply to 120187)

Truman: Hi, I just deployed Jetton, to revoke admin role in the Jetton, I need to change the admin to an empty address right? What is an empty address on Ton network?

&rey: b{00} (two zero bits) is. It is commonly represented as null offchain. (reply to 120198)

Mohammad: What is problem?(for reaction) (reply to 120202)

&rey: Please visit docs.ton.org instead of me explaining code to everyone who asks. (reply to 120205)

&rey: It should be read correctly, actually. (reply to 120208)

S: same value is read no matter what I store

Leo: you made some basic mistake, obviously just learn something from the docs before writing codes to develop efficiently

Haint: is that the first call using in_msg_body? you might have load something before that statement (reply to 120208)

S: no (reply to 120214)

Haint: you can do some basic debugging such as seeing if the opcode is correct in the printed res.transactions (reply to 120215)

Alex: Hi guys!  I'm facing the problem that using the TonConnectUI, if an user doesn't have the transaction asset wallet (for example GRAM or NOT or whatever) - it initiates the transfer only with TON commission and as a result - it just sends the commission value and pays that commission for nothing. How I can avoid that strange situation? How can I make this transfer failed automatically?

&rey: You can lookup user's jetton balance via tonapi / toncenter / lots of other APIs. (reply to 120255)

Allan | Alimango Studios: hi we developed a market maker and vol bot for ton connected to stonfi. for wallets, the max we can do is 4 wallets at a time. is this normal for ton? also the confirmation when buying takes long time. we have private rpc but the buy and sell is painstakingly slow. is this normal for ton? is there anyway to make the tx faster?

Tom: Yeah. Unfortunately it's true. (reply to 120486)

Allan | Alimango Studios: hi is there a way to have a faster confirmation?

&rey: If you're already sending message to public RPCs (they often work better than private ones), there isn't. (reply to 120491)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: public RPCs work better for sending transactions? that's surprising. it it because they broadcast to more widely used mempools? (reply to 120492)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: i have my own liteserver, it works no better than toncenter/tonapi in terms of transaction confirmation

Allan | Alimango Studios: i used both public and private. the private prevented the fail and errors but the speed is the same. also why is it that only 4 wallets works and cant be increased to more than 4? i built a bot to disperse fund from one wallet to several wallet for volume maker and network cant handler more than 4 for disperse. but for buying and selling it can handle even 50 wallets but the problem is, its too slow.

Heydar: hello, guys what's tick-tock transaction?

Bzzzz: Currently, your contract needs to reach a balance -1 TON as result of storage fee accumulation to be deleted. (reply to 120811)

&rey: Probably second one. (reply to 120816)

Mehrdad: first of all you maybe know that there is a specific jetton_wallet for each wallet on each jetton. I mean: if my main wallet address ( owner_address ) is "A" and jetton contract address ( jetton_address ) is "B" my jetton_wallet_address will be "C" it can made by online or offline ways!  Now you have some option (atleast!!) ‚ùáÔ∏è option 1 (using toncenter v3): https://toncenter.com/api/v3/jetton/wallets?owner_address={owner_address}&jetton_address={jetton_address} example: https://toncenter.com/api/v3/jetton/wallets?owner_address=0:4ef9ec44adee766ac978698d9ccbad09089008da36882aea13f30cf5d8194bfc&jetton_address=0:b113a994b5024a16719f69139328eb759596c38a25f59028b146fecdc3621dfe  ‚ùáÔ∏è option 2 (using toncenter v2): first you need to make your jetton_wallet_address then use : https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getTokenData?address={jetton_wallet_address} example: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getTokenData?address=0%3A5FFDF7F52FAD68743D0C85DCF296032662C5880DBCED9B66597066D0627905F9  ‚ùáÔ∏è option 3 (using tonapi): https://tonapi.io/v2/accounts/{owner_address}/jettons example: https://tonapi.io/v2/accounts/0%3A4ef9ec44adee766ac978698d9ccbad09089008da36882aea13f30cf5d8194bfc/jettons  others like anton and dton and .... are available!

Nix: How to get Ton send or receive transactions list for my address for a long period of time, eg 3 months.

&rey: 1. You're assuming that someone holds that list. Archival nodes do, indeed, but only of their good will. 2. Use Toncenter's getTransactions with archival=true. (reply to 120924)

Nix: Can I get 1k to 2k transactions by using Toncenter's api? (reply to 120925)

&rey: Oh. You can, by iterating and going towards older transactions, however it'd be better to load transactions via pytoniq (again, you need to connect to archival liteserver). (reply to 120926)

solarman.: Good afternoon, is there any way to get NFT and Jettons wallet via standard tools @tonconnect/ui-react or others in React, without invoking external APIs?

&rey: Well, anyway "external APIs" are invoked. TON Connect is write-only so you need something other. Also, NFTs list is not anywhere in blockchain so you do need an indexer like dton.io/graphql or tonapi (reply to 120936)

solarman.: thx. (reply to 120941)

S: When we deploy a minter contract, we provide wallet's code, to be stored in its cell. What's the difference between using raw complied code of the contract and library code?

Bzzzz: in the first case, each wallet pays a storage fee for its own contract code. when using a library, all wallets can share and access the code from the library, eliminating the need for individual storage fees for contract code (reply to 121035)

S: so overall fee decreases?

&rey: *the main fee contributor is probably forward fee upon jw-to-jw messages, not storage (reply to 121037)

S: So I wouldn't need to deduct any coins when sending messages from a wallet contract?

S: TONs damn bot

&rey: Baseless hope. There will be all fees, just smaller. (reply to 121040)

&rey: 1. It isn't luck, internals are strictly ordered; whitepaper knows how, but they cannot be reordered. 2. "mined"... "processed" is a more fitting word. 3. Internal messages in single shard may be processed in the same block when they were generated; cross-shard ones have to be routed first. (reply to 121137)

yash: so you mean these are malicious wallets or validators addresses that were slashed? (reply to 121280)

&rey: No. They were suspended (made unable to activate until certain time) out of concern that they could ruin TON price, and of observation that holders ignored call to show any activity. (reply to 121281)

Grimmie: ü§î

&rey: By definition it is not the same transaction. (reply to 121538)

&rey: Have you read about what TON is, and what it's doing to allow more throughput? It is most certainly not "other chains", to the point where it is easier to forget mechanics of latter. (reply to 121548)

Grimmie: not much :) could you please send me any link to learn more? (reply to 121551)

&rey: https://docs.ton.org/ton.pdf >  Infnite Sharding Paradigm. Almost all blockchain sharding proposals are top-down: one first imagines a single blockchain, and then discusses how to split it into several interacting shardchains to improve performance and achieve scalability. > The TON approach to sharding is bottom-up, explained as follows. Imagine that sharding has been taken to its extreme, so that exactly one account or smart contract remains in each shardchain. Then we have a huge number of account-chains, each describing the state and state transitions of only one account, and sending value-bearing messages to each other to transfer value and information. > <...> > The Infinite Sharding Paradigm instructs us to regard each account (or smart contract) as if it were in its own shardchain by itself. Then the only way one account might affect the state of another is by sending a message to it (this is a special instance of the so-called Actor model, with accounts as Actors; cf. 2.4.2). > Therefore, a system of messages between accounts (and shardchains, because the source and destination accounts are, generally speaking, located in different shardchains) is of paramount importance to a scalable system such as the TON Blockchain.   The thing you were talking about, which is indeed one and the same, can be called "transaction tree". You have to define its unique parameter yourself; usually it will refer to hash of its first transaction. (reply to 121552)

Grimmie: "You have to define its unique parameter yourself; usually it will refer to hash of its first transaction."

Grimmie: is there any way to set up the unique param?

&rey: Go up the transaction tree while`in_msg` is internal message (carrying TON, generated by some prior transaction). Stop when in_msg is null or external message. (reply to 121557)

Grimmie: {   eventId: 'b08b3d3a8bad8ad7fd79719a68cd36e5b3bf32753065d30c37c2215be9676f38',   timestamp: 1730909117,   actions: [     {       type: 'TonTransfer',       status: 'ok',       TonTransfer: [Object],       simplePreview: [Object],       baseTransactions: [Array]     }   ],   valueFlow: [     { account: [Object], ton: -606n, fees: 200606n },     { account: [Object], ton: -3275406n, fees: 3075406n }   ],   isScam: false,   lt: 50634751000001n,   inProgress: false }

Grimmie: i just use parsed data from tx hash

Grimmie: ahhhhh i found cool thing. eventId is same

Grimmie: but in this case, i still do one more parsing that is NOT necessary

Grimmie: it would be great if there's any unique event id in websocket event response too, but it doesn't have {   "jsonrpc":"2.0",   "method":"account_transaction",   "params":{     "account_id":"-1:5555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555",     "lt":37121758000003,     "tx_hash":"586e176bdead2a37d9e372c3725e27c4eab90f5b213c6099c6aadeafc8e4fbc9"   } }

Grimmie: it inclues tx_hash and account id only

AutoflowerX Trumsta ft Elon - ECONOMIX: hi guys

reza: hello friends   I have a question, what exactly is this amount and what does it do? If anyone knows, I would be grateful

&rey: TON network requires any contract to specify how much TON is sent to process its message. In particular, wallet contract sends some TON with jetton transfer order; some of those might be forwarded, but a large portion must be provided for fees. (reply to 121626)

reza: Does this mean that this amount is considered the network fee? (reply to 121628)

&rey: Yes. Jetton wallet will spend part of it on computation+action+etc, will send part forward; if badly written, some TON will stick to the jetton wallet. (reply to 121630)

User<7418242907>: Hello my Friend! I have an NFT release coming up. The NF gives access to a private chat. I need a bot that can use the wallet address to check if the user has an nft. Maybe his ready-made solutions?

reza: Determining the amount is the hand of the programmer.  How much is the floor of this amount?   And what is the difference with someone who has determined 0.01 or 0.1 for example? (reply to 121631)

Yes: 0.1

Mika: If the transfer was done with excessive fee, will the Blockchain return some of the fees which it didn't spend? (reply to 121628)

&rey: No, the unused TON will be left at balance of whichever contract didn't use them.  Jetton transfer supports setting response_destination where all excess TON will go. It's normally set to sender's address. (reply to 121644)

Mika: Thanks for your reply. I was writing a code to simply transfer jettons I buy from one wallet to another. But I was confused about setting the fees. 1) should I estimate the transfer fee and just use it Or 2) Use excessive fee and set response_destination as the sender address to receive the any unused TON?  From what I read using excessive fee doesn't guarantee transaction speed as TON is asynchronous. But option (2) seems faster, but I don't know if it is cheaper! Could you offer me your knowledge on the matter? Thanks. (reply to 121645)

Lyric: Hello!  I'm new. I need to transfer TON from my wallet to a friend's wallet using python or at least curl to figure out what's going on.  I tried some list of libraries for python, but there are either no methods for transferring funds, or everything is not obvious

&rey: So do you understand that blockchain isn't your common backend and doesn't have central authority? (reply to 121719)

Lyric: so so. Now I understand it for sure)

&rey: There's no server that could accept your "login". Instead, your wallet contract authenticates you using digital signature. Signature is generated using keypair derived from the mnemonic.

Lyric: Can you explain this better? (reply to 121723)

Lyric: If I generate a mnemonic using a script, how will the blockchain verify and match the mnemonic with my wallet?

Lyric: If you can, please tell me what I need to read to understand "TON transfer" betterüôè

&rey: 24 words, also called "mnemonic"/"recovery words"/... are secret seed for keypair generation. Public key out of pair lies in your wallet contract's data. (reply to 121724)

&rey: Wallet receives an external message "signature XYZ, do transfer T TON with payload P to address A", checks XYZ using stored public key, and does the action.

sangmin: Is there a solution for decoding issues when parsing transactions according to the official documentation if special characters are included in the payload?

User<8053811500>: How long does it normally take to confirm a tx after it's been sent?

?: I am writing a smart contract for a game on tone.   There is a certain number of participants. All of them send the same hash to the contract when the game starts. This is how a "team" is formed.   Together with the hash, they send their betting bank and the guarantee amount. The money is frozen.   The game is played, then the one who wins takes the whole bank. Participants must confirm this by sending messages with the word true. If they don't confirm within the 1st day, the guarantee amount is deducted and their money is given back to them. Writing in tact, but I'd like a thought on how to approach this. I don't understand how to write the contract functionality itself and how many there should be

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: If I want to invite users with referral link via start_param, and must use initDataUnsafe for that and the docs states that users should be validated with InitDate (without Unsafe), does that mean that I should parse Unsafe for ref code and use InitData for verification of the user or?  I don't really get the difference between those two

Is there any other method of sending ton and getting the back the transaction hash?

Leo: Yes, marshal it as JSON text and use the snake/chunk encoding

Wisper: I am not able to send tokens jetton to the wallet from my unity game. Any help

Tom: Looks like getgems won't accept that. They have no documentation about onchain metadata for that particular attribute (reply to 122006)

Leo: tep64 only specifies string type attributes, so don't expect getgems/tonviewer to parse arbitrary structured type out of the string stored  the whole metadata is just a (string->string) mapping after all (reply to 122008)

Tom: Well, I mean getgems propose that attributes, I think they should take 1 step further and support fully onchain metadata following their docs (reply to 122009)

Leo: I didn't get you. don't they support fully onchain metadata? They are just not supporting JSON type other than strings, i.e. arrays, objects, numbers etc (reply to 122011)

Tom: https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts/blob/main/docs/metadata.md  social_links is a special attributes only supported by getgems. They define it as an array of string.  So in case of onchain metadata, I think they must support that.

Tom: I know there are plenty of options to store metadata, offchain or decentralized with ipfs. Just think that every option should be compatible.

Hossein: ???? (reply to 122001)

Leo: As I said, on-chain metadata standard only specifies string keys and string values, while off-chain JSON file can store arbitrary JSON types for values, so they are incompatible intrinsically (reply to 122014)

Leo: check this https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts/issues/38  non-string value types can only be stored off-chain

Leo: getgems can specify their own standard for storing arrays on-chain, of couse but not yet now

Tom: Thanks, looks like it's not coming soon (reply to 122017)

Andrei: Hi, I need a ton dapp developer to help me build a typescript class. The functions for the typescript class are the following: 1.  sendNative(options: { senderMnemonic: string, to: string, amount: number }): Promise<string | null>   - function returns either tx hash or null if transaction failed 2. sendToken(options: {senderMnemonic: string, to: string, amount: number, tokenAddress: string}): Promise<string | null>   -function returns either txHash or null if transaction failed 3. getTransactionDetails(hash: string)   -function returns generic tx data (from, to, txFees & amount in human readable format, tx timestamp, tokenAddress if applicable, didFundsBounced) 4. getWalletTxHistory(wallet: string)    -return an array of the same type as getTransactionDetails  Restrictions: txHashes returned by functions 1 & 2 must coincide with hashes returned by function 4 The typescript class should not depend on "wallet connect like" logic The class can have more functions if needed but these 4 are mandatory   Happy to use admin approved middleman or use hyve.works as middleman agent

&rey: Maybe a Python class would be enough?.. I have a similar one ready at hand, for instance. (reply to 122435)

Andrei: it's going to be used in a already existing api that needs to enable ton network and everything is written in typescript not really sure how I could use it in a smart way (reply to 122436)

‚Äå‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äå‚ÄåMohammad: Hi folks, is there any EASY solution to exchange tokens in TON and they give us an SDK to add to our app?  The app is on testnet, and it uses TON tokens to purchase our in-app tickets.  Currently, we're able show the list of tokens that a connected wallet has, and then we suggest them to exchange/swap those DOGS, NOT or etc to TON and then they'd be able to call our smart contract (more TONs, more tickets).

Heydar: Hello guys, who assign a node to be a validator ? and what should be validate by it? (I mean what's algorithm to assign what should be validated by it?)

&rey: 1. The Elector chooses set of nodes which offered their work and would have the largest total stake. 2. Catchain determines order in which validators generate blocks; however, everyone validates everything [at least on their shardchains]. (reply to 122533)

Heydar: their work? do you mean their powers or their history of working? (reply to 122535)

&rey: To participate, a validator uses mytonctrl and sends stake to the Elector contract; history of working is totally irrelevant there. (reply to 122536)

Heydar: So their power(PC strength) just help them in taking reward faster or slower, is that right?

Heydar: thanks for clear answers always. (reply to 122538)

Abdulaziz: Is this infiltration or not, if 1 tone is created every second? (reply to 122559)

Abdulaziz: The documentation said that annual inflation was 5%

&rey: There's no hard bound on total issued TON (nor lower nor upper bound). Also, mind that TON intends to cover more and more users. (reply to 122568)

Abdulaziz: The ton is related to the messenger so it's obvious (reply to 122569)

Abdulaziz: How many TONs has ever created right now, how to get this information (reply to 122569)

&rey: It's closer to TON not being related to Telegram, actually. (That perspective helps one to not fall for scam, custodial services; also TMA questions are very distinct in topic from TON-related ones and that's why they are directed to another chat.) (reply to 122571)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Guys, I have looked through all the search result for these keyword but haven't found any clear solutions so I must ask (again) regarding the confirmation of the transaction via tonConnect, because it's an instant condition for user to play my game (it's user's stake in the round).  Once the user signs the tx I have sent using TonConnect, how can I know if I that transactions has passed?  I saw that the closest event that ton connect has for this purpose is 'user signed tx', but I have no proof until some moment that it's confirmed?  I have seen that some people are doing that using seqNo, which I don't know if I can get from TonConnect, is this a moment where I must combine sent transaction via TonConnect with some ton/tonweb or any other sdk for blockchain interaction?

T.E.I üá®üá¶Tooncinator üå±SEED FLIES ü™∞üçë$WIFE: Never exchange any random tokens or NFTs you receive in wallet.  99.9% of the time its a scam.  Unless your aware of who the sender is, DO NOT interact.  Could very well drain wallet of all assets. (reply to 122663)

battle: I am a highly skilled Ton dev with extensive experience in TON chain development, specializing in smart contracts, NFTs and tg bots, tg mini-app development (e.g. tap games). In general, infinite data structures that can scale to billions of elements are very difficult to implement on blockchains. However, TON chain makes it possible by splitting data across multiple smart contracts. That's why I am interested in TON chain and familiar with Func and tact languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor developing smart contracts. On the front-end side, I have skillfully implemented the integration of smart contracts and front-end using Ton Connect SDK. Looking forward to the opportunity to work with you.

Martin: Hi guys, have you ever use "HASHEXT_SHA256" to concat two slices? I'm trying but it's throwing error 9

&rey: It's worth noting that non-custodial wallets do not have anything common with AML. (reply to 122663)

&rey: Check that total length is divisible by 8 bits. (reply to 122674)

&rey: Yes, just like your common wallet contract can handle any kind of token. (reply to 122660)

Martin: oh, it works. So, the number of bits must be divisible by 8 bits. I am using two addresses to concat, so the total is only 234. Thanks a lot (reply to 122676)

&rey: Btw you can skip some suffix bits instead of appending ones, probability of hash collision won't increase that much) (reply to 122679)

Martin: So instead of adding 2 more bits, I can remove some suffix ones, is it correct?

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Can someone help me, please,  I am trying to 'create' a wallet instance of an existing wallet via TonWeb, so that I can get its seqNo,  I am trying to do that this way (from their gitHub docs): tonweb.wallet.create({address: 'EQDjVXa_oltdBP64Nc__p397xLCvGm2IcZ1ba7anSW0NAkeP'});  But I am getting an error that 'create' doesn't exist? I saw that some people in this group use specific classes for wallet creation such as WalletCreateV4R2 (not sure if i quoted it correctly), but I don't know where to find those methods and are they backward compatible (since I want to let users use my app via any wallet version, as long as it is part of a TonConnect)

&rey: You can simply call the get-method via any API. (reply to 122728)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: My goal is to check seqNo, send a transaction and check again until it's incremented, does your response covers that case also?  And why is using API better in this case? (reply to 122729)

&rey: Because TonWeb also uses an API; thus, you have pure benefit of less code loaded. (reply to 122730)

Andrei: Hey! Looking for an advise. I'm developing a smart contract. Basically upon the call to the smart contract, object should be initiated, then upon other calls, it get's modified, and eventually distributes the funds. After that I don't really need the object anymore.  So, my question is, what is the best design approach here? Should I create 1 smart contract, deploy it, and store/clear objects  Or should I rather deploy a new instance of smart contract upon every object creation (not even sure yet if it's possible though)?  Thanks

&rey: Your "object" sounds logically an isolated smart contract. (reply to 122998)

&rey: I'm not even sure if you need the contract you've already thought of. Contracts can be initialized even with users' messages sent from frontend.

Andrei: Makes sense. IS it possible, however, to deploy a new contract from "master" contract and get back the address to my dapp? (reply to 123001)

&rey: Yes. Normally, you'd know the address even before sending message to master contract. (reply to 123003)

Andrei: Ah, ok, got it. I don't even need a master contract it seems.

Andrei: Perfect, thanks! Is there a chance you could point me to some docs on how to deploy contract from the js/python client? (reply to 123005)

&rey: Provide StateInit within message, as https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/sending-messages#smart-contract-deployment does (but using lib of your choice instead of TonWeb). (reply to 123007)

Andrei: Thanks a lot, appreciate it! (reply to 123010)

NASDAQ: does anyone use a tonutils library?

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Can someone tell me how are these 2 adresses the same: 1. Deposit address in the wallet: 0QB1SAO0Ok9AUEDgyxnwLxwhqH4yIjlptaPx75TD30eK-c2l  2. account.address field in tonConnect once connected: 0:754803b43a4f405040e0cb19f02f1c21a87e32223969b5a3f1ef94c3df478af9  And which one should I use as a destination address?

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Yes, both are the same wallet on the tonkeeper (reply to 123034)

&rey: You should use one of user-friendly forms: 0Q... if crediting something to user, and kQ... if you send some request/money which should bounce if user's wallet is uninit. (reply to 123033)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: How can I convert between those two? In case I want to show the user's wallet address, and I can only get the non-user-friendly via TonConnect?  By destination address, I mean on destination address in the transaction body (not when sending assets via wallet) (reply to 123042)

&rey: Address.parse('any form').toString({userFriendly: true, bounceable: false}) (reply to 123045)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: I am restricted to tonweb, it doesn't have a parse option :/ (reply to 123046)

&rey: (new Address('any form')).toString(true, true, false, false) (reply to 123047)

&rey: Also, make sure to backresolve user's address via Tonapi in case he has a domain attached (like wallet foundation.ton) so that domain name shown instead of just address.

Mehmet Ali: We have created a jetton and the transfer of the jetton from a wallet to b wallet costs around 0.5$. Is there a method (we use this on TRON) that we buy a big amount of TON and stake it to a contract and that covers some transfer fees of our jettons?

P: I am interested in your posting I am a Full Stack and Blockchain Engineer specializing in innovative solutions for Blockchain, Web3, NFTs, DeFi, Solana, Ethereum, Smart Contracts, Solidity, and Rust. I have experienced Jetton Wallet development, token automatic systems, and other experiences. Could you please give me an opportunity to work with you? (reply to 123057)

&rey: Mind if I validate your claim about "token automatic systems"? (reply to 123061)

P: sure (reply to 123062)

P: Can you  send DM?

&rey: What architecture would you use if jetton represented some game score; score could be increased by server at any time, and client would claim it whenever they want (and preferably sending 1 claim message even if additional jettons were issued ten times)? (reply to 123063)

&rey: Chat moderators usually do not DM first (so it's easier to tell scam from not-scam; whoever DMs first is under suspicion). (reply to 123064)

P: But, Do you have any project of good idea? (reply to 123066)

Jacob: how to write logic expression? such as    a > b   &&  c > d ?

Jacob: func does not support &&

&rey: (a > b) & (c > d), but mind parentheses if you don't remember operator priority

&rey: (though, that evaulates both expressions; if you need short-circuiting if first is false, you have to use if)

Jacob: Thank you very much (reply to 123185)

Valerii: Hi. I am sending a transaction through the tonconnect UI with the following payload.  The transaction is successfully sent and returns a BOC. When the transaction is in TON currency, I can parse the BOC and obtain in_msg.hash. However, when the transaction is in a token (e.g., HMSTR), parsing the BOC does not work ‚Äî a hash is generated that I cannot compare with anything because it differs.  The BOC returned by tonconnect: ...

kira: afternoon everyone I want to write a smart contract (by Tact) to deposit and withdraw USDT. Do you have idea how to do it?  Thank u so much ‚ù§Ô∏è

&rey: It isn't excessively hard, actually. Please look into TON Cookbook's image, remembering that your contract only sees whatever messages it receives/sends. (reply to 123206)

ZiomüëΩ: Hello guys I am new here how and where can I start

kira: so, the contract doesn't store USDT itself, right? and after transact USDT successfully, i will send a message to contract to log the transactions and save it to database?  am i understand right?

&rey: I've marked parts which are not seen to the contract.

&rey: Contract owns USDT but does not store it, right. Jetton wallets do the balance store. (reply to 123209)

&rey: It seems a good idea is by following the chat. (reply to 123208)

kira: hmm, could you explain more about the different between Jetton Wallet A and Jetton Wallet B, please? It's a bit confusing to me ü•≤ (reply to 123210)

&rey: Jetton wallet A: a separate contract that stores balance of specific jetton (like NOT) for user A. Jetton wallet B: a separate contract that stores balance of the same jetton for user B. (reply to 123214)

ZiomüëΩ: Thnx for replying So I have no clue what are ppl talking abt (reply to 123213)

&rey: Well, there are smart contracts which are essentially programs with balance and persistent data storage. In particular, wallets (that is, real, non-custodial ones) are smart contracts. (reply to 123216)

Forbes: hello, is there anyone looking for dev?

kira: soo, where the contract will be in your picture? could you explain about the flow of that?  I am doing a task, that when user send USDT to admin, it will be recorded by smart contract, and the transaction will be logged into database!  thank u so much for your help ‚ù§Ô∏è (reply to 123215)

ZiomüëΩ: Soo what shld I do now (reply to 123217)

ZiomüëΩ: I think I had read abt it something on website (reply to 123217)

&rey: In its role as sender, contract will be in place of "Wallet A". In receiver role, in place of "Wallet B". (reply to 123219)

&rey: Well I'm not sure what you want to do; I'd suggest deeping into contract examples/whitepapers. (reply to 123220)

kira: oh, i see.  If the contract is the receiver(Wallet B), contract will monitor Jetton Wallet B,  and after each transaction, Jetton Wallet B will send a message (JettonNotification) to contract (wallet B). in the function receive(msg: JettonNotification), emit an event to store transaction to database. am i right?

&rey: Well you don't need any events to monitor transactions, do you? (reply to 123225)

ZiomüëΩ: What is that.? (reply to 123224)

&rey: Whitepapers? They describe what TON strived to be and at what costs it achieved that. https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/whitepapers/overview (reply to 123227)

kira: because i want to store the info of transaction in database, so i think i need to trigger an event to the BE can catch it and store to database :D (reply to 123226)

ZiomüëΩ: Thnx üëç (reply to 123228)

&rey: Well you don't need to trigger any events, you should just listen to transactions on jetton wallet (the one which *sends* TransferNotification). (reply to 123229)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Don't know how it's confirmed when funds aren't deducted from the wallet

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: How to know when the transaction is lost so I let user know it should start a new one?

fade: i dont use testnet, but sometimes when you submit an external  message it can be lost, tonviewer could still show it as "pending transaction" but that's only a simulation, it can be deceptive (reply to 123267)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: What do you mean by 'external message', like a comment in the payload or? (reply to 123270)

GONZALES: Then, is there no way to make the token I issued verified and visible in the ton wallet? If I register the token in the wallet settings, can I make it visible? In the case of the ton keeper wallet, can I make it verified and visible? (reply to 123622)

&rey: You should consult Tonkeeper themselves, they're more likely to know. I've heard jetton TK-verification involves a pull request to their repository and some post. (reply to 123623)

Nasim: Hello everyone Our team is looking for a developer for smart contracts in Ton and Eth. Write to the Dm who are interested

Mantas: Hey! Maybe someone would be able to help me to understand why specific transaction bounced? I do not see any errors on it, or smth unusual. Funds were transfered to simple wallet (not smart contract) and just returned back.

Mantas: This is the tx id: 29083912e343d980fd5be40788599a33459afaf26df71035478b4a0e89535e83

User<8042106964>: that is because following account is in uninit state https://tonviewer.com/UQCNxUppjVm3S49ZbgHw1y826uKAMphFgSDMZVw2AQHPlVJJ (reply to 123650)

–û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ: assembly

TKAINU: i want to ask, a calculation in ton, i have decimal = 6 for example  a = 4/3 * 10^6 = 1333333 So when calculating b = a * 2, the result will be calculated based on a = 4/3 * 10^6 or a = 1333333 Because if you perform many calculations, the numbers after the decimal point will be incorrect

Mantas: what Uninit state means? sorry, I'm new to ton. Also, if that is the case, why some other transactions are successfull? (reply to 123652)

&rey: Only on integers. In particular, you should do arithmetic on indivisible amounts. (reply to 123655)

Akachi: Did you check bouncable flag? (reply to 123650)

Mantas: as I understand from the previous answer the issue that receiving wallet is in Uninit state. Can you help to understand what it means and why some transactions passed and fund were received? Maybe different sender wallets behave differently and some allow to send funds to such "uninit state", some not? (reply to 123661)

&rey: You are quite right.  When sender sets non-bounceable flag (UQ instead of EQ), all wallets except maybe TON Space flag the TON-carrying message as non-bounceable. Those messages do not bounce when their processing fails (as is case with uninit destination). (reply to 123662)

&rey: While I cannot understand the reasons for using wallets which fail on certain well-known usecases (if they in fact do), if you aim to support users of that wallet, you have to initialize the destination wallet.

Mantas: How I can initialize destination wallet? It was just simply created in TrustWallet (reply to 123664)

&rey: Well you can send an outgoing message (even to that wallet itself). (reply to 123666)

Mantas: Ah, so simple, thanks, I will let my client know and get back here if that doesn't solve the issue. Thanks a lot!

&rey: What's the source for that project.yaml layout? (reply to 124430)

–î–∞–Ω—è: I couldn‚Äôt find any tutorials so i asked chat gpt (reply to 124438)

&rey: Chatbots are worse than useless for TON actually. (Or for designing project architecture, as it turned out when I tested.)  An example how to work with toncli is at https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ton-contract-template. When using it, I assume anything not there is unavailable. (reply to 124440)

–î–∞–Ω—è: Alright, Thank you

&rey: Network ID: -239 or -3. And no you can't ask the wallet to switch; a particular reason is that users often use different wallet apps for mainnet and testnet. (reply to 124403)

User<7376766125>: Multisender (reply to 124559)

oracle: its working, tnks (reply to 124557)

&rey: There is no such thing as "jetton" or "forward" on level of blockchain itself, only messages transferring some TON with specific payloads and contracts changing their state.  Therefore, for your question to be well-formed, you must write down what TON transfers do you want to happen. (reply to 124554)

Tom: Hey guys, imagine the state_init containing data of first bit as "false". Inside the recv_internal we use the bit as a lock. Only process if it's false. Then switch it to true.  Is race-condition possible if we send multiple messages with the same state_init in the body? Is it guaranteed that the lock will be concurrent-safe?

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Ok, what I want to do is when user sends to me SC for example 1 TON, I want to acquire like 0.05 TON more through (forward) fees that I am later going to use when sending assets to users That's what I am trying to accomplish basically  Does it matter if I am trying to do that while sending transaction via TonConnect (in case that SDK isn't supporting custom forward fees)? (reply to 124564)

&rey: Well you can't obtain any additional TON by design. You must make user send 1.05 TON. (reply to 124572)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Ok, how did some apps (although via Jettons) took more fees than needed and stored them in order to distribute rewards later based on those fees?  Is there some other way or is it because jettons? (reply to 124573)

&rey: Transactions on each contract are executed sequentially. If your scheme works correctly whenever serialized, all is OK (reply to 124571)

&rey: TON Connect 2 shows how much is sent exactly. From that amount, contract may split in arbitrary way (and use previously accumulated balance is needed). (reply to 124574)

&rey: It would be preferable to know what your project is about (what needs so much for tests?); also, please confirm if you've done tests in ton/sandbox. Usually given that @f_closer can provide some testnet TON. (reply to 124596)

&rey: I find it strange that lots of people have taken test TON but not many said what project they managed to build/fix; would be really interesting to know the interests sphere (DeFi? staking? onchain tx verification? custom contracts?)

&rey: Please note that docs development is shaped by pretty much this; the better the information, the more focused docs pages are.

&rey: Wdym "by API"? You must not provide secret key to any service network-separated from you. Transferring TON from a wallet without a signed message or its secret key is impossible. (reply to 124629)

&rey: In fact I do. https://t.me/tondev_eng/121717.  If u can engage with docs and connect the script parts, that be very good but also immensely more useful to you. (reply to 124632)

Artur: Hello guys. I need help about Ton transactions. How can I get webhook request or something like that to get received transaction to my address. Now I am using cron job to get latest transactions from my address but need to make it more dynamic like using webhook

Artur: Yess (reply to 124685)

&rey: Not a good idea to always call me! Chat history arguably knows more than me!  I don't know if there is a reliable service loading transactions and sending webhook calls. Low-level functionality certainly doesn't provide that ‚Äî either all transactions are loaded or only requested ones. (reply to 124687)

Rasoul: This is a liquidity transaction that resulted in 16.45 LP token, but this number cannot be found in the transaction details. (reply to 125265)

Rasoul: Is the issue clear? (reply to 125265)

&rey: Well I don't think it resulted in any LP tokens, or they are non-TEP-74 compliant.  I'm still unsure if this is on topic. (reply to 125279)

Rasoul: I don't understand what you mean, but if you mean that the transaction does not generate any lp tokens, you are wrong because this is a real transaction and it has been tested. Here is the account to check the history  https://tonviewer.com/UQBFV_luWqdFBtWhCedfVYCim_S7xVduCIa12eXVJEETv9Wb  Let me put it more simply, the problem is that after liquidity is generated in the transactions, there is no sign of receiving lp tokens. (reply to 125282)

Rasoul: And I want to know how to extract it from the network.

Mehmet Ali: Tonkeeper wallet estimates TON fee for jetton transfers differently for each platform Like the tgapp calculated 0.10 TON, desktopapp 0.05 TON and androidapp 0.03 TON. Because our jetton need about 0.09 TON fee, below calculation transfer fails even we have enough TON in our wallets. Trying to reach support for over 2 week from TG, X and LinkedIn. No response!

Rasoul: Can you advise me on what to check to get the answer? (reply to 125282)

&rey: You should contact @subden probably. (reply to 125290)

–î–∞–Ω—è: what to you mean how do i obtain them? I got them by compiling tact files (reply to 125355)

AmirhN: Is there any way to find when a contract was deployed? e.g when was the first time a personal wallet became active or a token launched?

Terry: yes, you can use dTON GraphQL API for this (reply to 125400)

AmirhN: Thanks! Will check it out! (reply to 125401)

Terry: or, simply query it via tonscanner if it's not for development purpose (reply to 125400)

AmirhN: it is for development purposes, but i'm not really familiar with GraphQL, so i was more looking for a simple rest API, didn't find anything related in tonapi[.]io (reply to 125404)

AmirhN: but if that's the only way ill figure it out :p

JOBIANS TECHIE: I want to add it in comment (reply to 125470)

‚Äå‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äå‚ÄåMohammad: Hi folks,  We're testing our smart contract using TON TESTNET token and we're at the stage of requiring more than 150 TON TESTNET.  Can someone do a favor to send a few? üôèüèº

&rey: It would be preferable to know what your project is about (what needs so much for tests?); also, please confirm if you've done tests in ton/sandbox. Usually given that @f_closer can provide some testnet TON. (reply to 125638)

‚Äå‚Äå ‚Äå‚Äå‚ÄåMohammad: It's basically a lottery app. We're doing our beta test in testnet And in this case I would like to follow real case scenario instead of lower amounts. So that I needed much more tokens.  I need to mention that we're part of TON Nest lvl 2.  Should I DM @f_closer ? (reply to 125647)

2happy: How much Ton I need in nft smart contract to store it for one year? What happens when the imbalance is zero, when it is removed

&rey: Depends on content repr size. Nothing. Frozen on -0.1 TON, deleted at -1 TON. (reply to 125657)

/B4ckSl4sh\: How the contract may be removed if It doesn't pay for storage (or anything else) when frozen? Or it pays for storage of its 256 bit hash of last state? (reply to 125658)

&rey: It does, + due fees (last transaction) data is also stored. (reply to 125660)

Tom: So if we use calculated address and its deployment as the replay guard, it is technically vulnerable? When that particular contract is out of balance for storage, c4 is empty so the attempt to deploy will succeed? (reply to 125658)

&rey: Please calculate WHEN that will happen. (reply to 125671)

Tom: I mean, if the user is the one who deploy the replay guard they could intentionally leave the balance as low as possible. In common sense, we might have a check for storage fee of 5 years but after that period, they could double claim right? (reply to 125672)

Tom: From my point of view, the chance of that scenario is kinda low but possible. And long vesting is also common in real world.

Tom: So basically the expiration is a good practice and when create a token distribution like this, we have to take the maximum expiration into account for storage requirement.

&rey: Well after something like two thousand years they could claim again, yes. (reply to 125673)

Tom: The more refs and cells my contract has, the higher storage fee required. E.g. this implementation. https://github.com/Gusarich/airdrop So 5 years is still a small amount but 10 years would be noticeable amount for most users. (reply to 125676)

Tom: Could optimize the fee with library cell right?

&rey: Once your contract is frozen at -0.1 TON, it no longer has those refs. (reply to 125677)

Tom: I see, so the c4 slot is still alive? That would explain a lot. (reply to 125679)

Tom: I thought frozen state = load_data will result in an empty state. My bad.

&rey: In frozen state contract will simply refuse to execute anything unless defrosted first. (reply to 125683)

Tom: Thanks a lot. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm missing here. (reply to 125684)

&rey: (Therefore it will not forward any requests to your central contract until it reaches -1.0 TON, and that takes two thousand years in basechain.)

Tom: Is this behavior testable with sandbox? I‚Äôm going to write one to learn more. Will it behave the same if i change blockchain.now?

&rey: It should, except that to my knowledge TON uses uint32 timestamps which will run out by 2106. (reply to 125687)

Tom: Good to know, I will test it with lower expiration and observe the behavior of frozen state. Thanks a lot for sharing (reply to 125688)

&rey: Well whatever you use for compiling Tact also supports deploying the compiled contracts. (reply to 125357)

Tom: Today I also read about the shard optimization from PixelPlex team. It‚Äôs eye-opening and interesting. There is so much to learn  https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/airdrop-claim-best-practice

‚Äî 2024-11-25 ‚Äî

&rey: Wdym? In TON, it is by design impossible to pull something from another contract unless it explicitly supports that. That ensures user safety against honeypots, limiting any potential loss to the amount sent in first transaction. (reply to 125800)

T: Has anyone worked with Omniston SDK? I have a couple of questions regarding loading the token balance and making a swap from other tokens not placed in the demo

Carlton Bags | Kek.fm: hey guys. i am coming from the eth ecosystem and looking into ton now. i read an article that stated transactions are not atomic but async. is there documentation available that explains a bit more on how to ensure then that transactions are rolled back when a transaction-step fails?

&rey: No transaction-steps here; one transaction = one contract changes = one message processed. (reply to 125865)

&rey: You're perhaps speaking of transaction trees ‚Äì a convenience view of what happens. Anyway, you can't take back any funds which have already been sent.

Carlton Bags | Kek.fm: Isnt that impractical? For example something like flash loans. When you try to repay at the end of the tx but this fails, the rest of the state changes persist. (reply to 125867)

&rey: That is the design of TON. And yeah if something is not implementable (in reality/in TON) then there's no point attempting to implement it as is (in reality/in TON). (reply to 125870)

Carlton Bags | Kek.fm: But what upside is there to have it implemented like that? (reply to 125873)

Carlton Bags | Kek.fm: It makes it really painful to implement  defi apps (reply to 125873)

&rey: All transactions require bounded amount of data and therefore can always progress. More throughput; basically, whatever infinite sharding offers. (reply to 125875)

&rey: You should reconsider need for those dApps and specific implementations then. (Early on, TON was focused on utility applications; there are traces of that in the whitepapers.) (reply to 125877)

Carlton Bags | Kek.fm: Thx for your answers. Can you point to which utility applications were in mind? Instant messaging? (reply to 125879)

Carlton Bags | Kek.fm: Cause defi does not seem to be the target then

Roman: Have you checked TON Blockchain Course already? I believe there was a topic on that. In short you may opt to use internal tokens to represent state of your dApp. However i've never seen the implementation (reply to 125865)

Carlton Bags | Kek.fm: Will check that out (reply to 125885)

Cryo_mil: Hello erveryone I have made it far with my mini app i am now on the smart contract part and am Having trouble Ive added blueprint sdk but am struggling to invoke functions for NFTS and jettons

WhyesCode: Could you provide more context or clarity what the issue is? (reply to 125919)

Cryo_mil: I want to create a burn contract that Transfers the NFT or jetton to a deadaddress and will give rewards such as ton back to the sender

WhyesCode: If you don't know how to do that. You should consider having a professional doing it for you. (reply to 125939)

WhyesCode: Or do you just need a guide?

Cryo_mil: I just need guidance I‚Äôve looked at the docs am using blueprint sdk and tact language

Cryo_mil: Im tryna do off chain for the NFTs and transfer it to a dead address when NfT address is selected

T: Hi, I have a question about Omniston-SDK, is there any chance i can still use it's SDK with tokens that are not listed on beta version of app, im trying to override it's api and use without additional check from omni but it shows me error of fetching balances each time I'm trying to perform a swap with jettons that isn't listed on beta version of Omniston

&rey: Well firstly there's no onchain method of determining if something is an NFT; secondly, jettons are usually true-burned instead of transfer to zero or null address; thirdly, what if someone mints a fresh NFT and then takes "recycle" reward from your contract? The balance might run out. (reply to 125939)

Mathew: Did you find a way around it (reply to 125945)

Cryo_mil: No (reply to 125952)

Nick: Hi, guys, could you help me realize how does ton calculate it's comission when it's included in transaction? (with sending mode of 64 -carry all the remaining value of the inbound message)  I've sent 1 message with 3 Ton transfers inside a single message (0.05 TON each transfer amount). I also tried to estimate the fee with dedicated API method and it said that my fee amount is gonna be about 0.00096203 TON  Hence each transaction should be sent with amount ~0.049 TON but actually each transaction amout is 0.0479308. How does it calculate the fee and how can I try to estimate it the right way? That's tonviewer link with my last 3 transactions in there for a better context

Victor: Hello everyone, I have a question, has anyone tried to save a file in a TON Blockchain, do I just save the bits of the file in a TON cell, and if the file does not fit into the cell, then I transfer them to another cell and connect them with links? Can the same thing be done with any file type, media, text and other formats?

Tom: Yes, basically buffer. (reply to 125981)

Tom: The linking is called snake cell, afaik

Victor: I have another question about TON Storage: does it store data on the blockchain or somehow on distributed network nodes, like IPFS?

M: üîÑ Question about TON Connect wallet restoration in .NET/Python  I'm working with TON Connect and successfully implemented wallet connection using:   var options = new TonConnectOptions { ManifestUrl = "..." }; var storage = new RemoteStorage(...); // custom storage implementation var tonConnect = new TonConnect(options, storage);  // Later restoring connection var restored = await tonConnect.RestoreConnection();  Few questions about wallet restoration:  1- Is RemoteStorage mandatory for restoration? 2- What's the best practice for storing wallet data - should we persist it in a database or is temporary storage enough? 3- For a web API, would storing the connection details in a user's session be sufficient?  Would appreciate any insights on proper wallet restoration patterns, especially for server-side implementations!  #tonconnect #development #dotnet #python

&rey: You know that usually TON Connect 2 is used on frontend, right? (reply to 126010)

M: Thanks for the response! yes, I understand TON Connect 2 is typically frontend-focused. however, I'm working on a backend service that needs to:  1. Handle authorized wallet operations 2. Maintain wallet sessions for authenticated users 3. Execute automated transactions for approved wallets  Is there a recommended pattern for server-side TON integrations? or should I be architecting this differently - perhaps with frontend handling the wallet connection and passing signed transactions to the backend?  would appreciate any guidance on best practices for this use case!

Mujtaba: Hello fam,   I am new to TON ecosystem (though I have read a lot of theory on it) and am trying to customise the Jetton standard contract.   While I noticed a lot of improvement opportunities in the repo but feels like the repository isn‚Äôt actively maintained (opened issues are unattended, PRs are waiting indefinitely to be merged and tests failing on the recent config params) Is there a specific reason for this?

Mujtaba: Do we know who are maintaining the repo and are they open to contributions?

&rey: Well the standard impl is provided for validating that your own is working correctly, one should write their own whenever possible.

fjila: If i send the ton back, then commit and then throw the error

Valentin: Does locking liquidity work in ton as in other chains where LP tokens have to be burned?

&rey: IIRC here LP tokens on burn return your liquidity back. You can use pools which do not track added liquidity at all (well now you can't because there are none, but it's an option) or send them to whatever address you see fit. Usually, 0:000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is used. (reply to 126300)

Valentin: but is this typically done here? I'm checking for most well known tokens and the owners of the LP tokens are not 0 address

&rey: Well whoever farms presumably want to pull liquidity out when they choose to move on to another token. (reply to 126303)

sangmin: I understand. If so, can I know in advance how much fee the recipient will spend? (reply to 126386)

&rey: Onchain, no contract can, because receiver is potentially in another shard and inaccessible to the validator generating block. (reply to 126387)

sangmin: If so, is it correct that the recipient has to pay the fee unconditionally? (reply to 126388)

sangmin: Thank you for the information. !!

Kyle: Is there anyone have this error: web version wallet reports 'Error: Unsupported Link' when tonConnectUI.sendTransaction. Pls help me

Cryo_mil: is test net not a thing anymore on tonkeeper? its not working with blueprint

ethan: hey guys, one of my jetton user wallet has nearly 1 ton balance, is there a way to withdraw the TON coin balance of my jetton user wallet?

Piri Piri: Hello! I've deployed a "NFT Collection" Contract on test net using WalletContractV5R1 with mnemonic.  However my Tonkeeper wallet address differs from the contract deployer address even thou i am using the same mnemonic. What could be the reason for this discrepancy?

Tom: How different? (reply to 126420)

Piri Piri: Inside tonkeeper wallet (W5 TESTNET) address is a different one than the contract deployer address.  Both addresses have Contract Type wallet v5 r1 (reply to 126421)

Gift: True...my fifth sense is always with meüòä (reply to 126294)

Tom: Do they have the same format of bounceable or testnet? What are the prefixes? (reply to 126423)

Piri Piri: Well for example putting the addresses on ton org/address, results in no common format of the addresses

Piri Piri: bounceable/non-bounceable main/testnet

Piri Piri: about prefixes tonkeeper: 0QBIWDf collection: kQABdd_-

Olesia: why reentrancy is not possible in ton?

Anton: because your messages are not sent immediately but rather queued to be sent after executing your logic (reply to 126438)

Olesia: thank you (reply to 126439)

Anton: but still it‚Äôs possible to run into an issue similar to re-entrancy, when you process an incoming message, change the state of your contract so that some security-related invariant is violated (maybe be you are waiting for a response of another contract) and then react to a third-party message in a way that wasn‚Äôt intended

Anton: this pattern is usually called message-in-the-middle

Antoxa: Advise which bot to use to pay for a paid subscription to the channel, I would like the payment to be in tone or stars. There are some ready-made solutions.

&rey: You should DYOR on prices/extra features/comparison/etc but I shall suggest the baseline solution: CryptoBot can do that. (reply to 126445)

Tom: Try comparing same prefix or parse and check the raw address (reply to 126431)

&rey: They are indeed different, the changing prefix is not that long. (reply to 126448)

Tom: The kind of attack won‚Äôt work if my message containing both deploy state init and specific logic inside body right? (reply to 126442)

Anton: but happens after that? the contract still could be a target (reply to 126450)

Louis: Hi guys I am trying to understand how I can know which token is transferred when I am analysing a jetton_internal_transfer ?

&rey: That information is not provided explicitly, but you can check jetton-data of any participating jetton wallet. (reply to 126452)

Louis: Ok thanks a lot and can this be achieved via the RPC ?

Tom: I mean in the same inMessage. With both body and state init (reply to 126451)

Anton: no, no, message-in-the-middle needs at least two incoming messages to be applicable (reply to 126455)

Kohl: You will need indexing services like Toncenter V3 APIs (reply to 126452)

Antoxa: CryptoBot - well, it's very clumsy, what other options are there, otherwise in this bot you can not choose payment through a keeper or an internal cart wallet. (reply to 126446)

Louis: Actually I am trying to use tonapi but they do not return the information and I was wondering how I can parse it ... (reply to 126458)

Edm: Hi, I've been facing smart contract action phase error with code 50. Does anyone has experience and know what does this mean?

Tom: Highly depends on the implementation of contract if it‚Äôs not here  https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes (reply to 126470)

Tom: Btw, somehow the official reference of jetton contract returns the same custom exit code for two different scenario lol üòÇ 709 if I remember correctly (reply to 126471)

Edm: thanks. I just find out the 50 exit code is standard in tact compiler. Since I don't own the smart contract, is there any way to bypass this error?  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes/#50 (reply to 126471)

Anton: it is not Tact-specific, Tact utilizes exit codes from 128 to 255, it‚Äôs just Tact‚Äôs documentation documents even more TVM exit code than TON docs (reply to 126474)

Kohl: You get only jetton-master address in transaction response, to map address to name you can use another API: https://toncenter.com/api/v3/jetton/masters (reply to 126464)

Cryo_mil: Any devs that can code a Jetton burner and NFT burner on ton blockchain that will give back TON for burn

&rey: Swap fee? It can be there, yes. (reply to 126523)

&rey: Where would said TON come from? (reply to 126556)

Cryo_mil: from closing the cell and withdrawing the ton is what my higher up told me he want done (reply to 126559)

Cryo_mil: basically like sol slugs functionality if youve ever seen it  @pcrafter

&rey: TON doesn't offer any refund on deleting contracts. Moreover, most NFT contracts don't support deletion. (reply to 126560)

Cryo_mil: yes im aware of NFts not burnable they just get sent to a void address normally, my boss is convinced that closing cells that have been previously created would be the way to do it on ton blockchain (reply to 126562)

&rey: Well that would not achieve anything. He's welcome to show transaction, or whitepaper reference, pointing otherwise. (reply to 126566)

Cryo_mil: ive researched and see that you can use jetton burn by sending message to the contract which i havent  figure out but i do believe theres no way to refund it right I would have to have a wallet address filled with ton to redistribute

&rey: Yes. and someone could mint and burn jettons only to make your contract run out. (reply to 126568)

Cryo_mil: ok so he sent me this Below is an implementation of a burn function in FunC for closing cell accounts and retrieving the TON contained within. The function destroys the contract (cell account) and transfers its remaining balance to a specified recipient.

Cryo_mil: the method hes referring to is closing cells

Cryo_mil: @pcrafter

&rey: Well, even if it worked (and it doesn't), it would only transfer contract's balance. (reply to 126572)

2happy: I found a mistake in the documentation  https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/cookbook#writing-comments-long-strings-in-snake-format  Here we need to replace this   function readStringTail(slice) {     const str = new TextDecoder('ascii').decode(slice.array); // decode uint8array to string     if (cell.refs.length > 0) {         return str + readStringTail(cell.refs[0].beginParse()); // read next cell     } else {         return str;     }  with this function readStringTail(slice) {   const str = new TextDecoder('ascii').decode(slice.array); // decode uint8array to string   if (slice.refs.length > 0)     return str + readStringTail(slice.refs[0]); // read next cell   else     return str; }  How can i contribute?

Ar: No bug still exists

Piri Piri: Hello again! I come with the same issue from yesterday (sorry but I couldn't figure it out) So I've created this new Tonkeeper wallet and the address shown for W5 Testnet is: 0QDW7gnZ2nTgEbMQti0QspcjtTywaEEm4JYxVoY_L3MgTssO I've followed the guide for NFT Minting, from docs ton org. Even thou I've copied the exact mnemonic, the addresses are not similar to the one in testnet: Bounceable Address:  EQBS1Nn2bIPS2twP9NLk6Gcbj3tL6WfWXAbOtm8DR6i_db6y Non-bounceable Address:  UQBS1Nn2bIPS2twP9NLk6Gcbj3tL6WfWXAbOtm8DR6i_deN3  What could be the reason for this? I can share the code but it's pretty much identical to the one from ton docs

Piri Piri: Basically there is a miss match between address inside Tonkeeper and address in the contract, imported with the mnemonic from Tonkeeper

Ar: is tonkeeper the only wallet with acces to testnet?

Piri Piri: I'm only using Tonkeeper and I have (only) two different testnet wallets inside. Tried with both but I'm facing the same issue

Ar: I may have the same issue, I just thought blueprint gets the address from different place, other then the  one configureded in .env (reply to 126618)

Piri Piri: I meant that inside tonkeeper app I'm using two wallets, and inside the contract i've inserted mnemonics from each. It results into different owner addresses every time

Piri Piri: I mean, each mnemonic generates its own unique deployer address when used inside the contract

Piri Piri: Ok so I've switched the code from WalletContractV5R1 to WalletContractV4, and also in tonkeeper i've added the v4r2 wallet (same mnemonic) and now the addresses are the same.

&rey: Then script's subwalletID is incorrect for testnet. (reply to 126627)

N üçÖ: LOL (reply to 123416)

Yei: I can't switch tonkeeper to testnet too, shows a blank screen when i try (reply to 126620)

B: Hello all, serious answers please  I am considering to become a full time Ton Dev, is there a demand as in jobs available out there? And where?

Ar: My subjective opinion is that there is only demand only for seniors now, not only in TON Dev, but the whole Smart Contract and Blockchain industry (reply to 126631)

Ar: you need to be ready to start to work for very low compensation in some companies that want to experiment this new position 'Smart Contract Developer' and be work not only for TON System but for Solana and EVM like networks too

B: Thank you for sharing, I truly appreciate it (reply to 126634)

Ar: Also a very good skill will be to learn write test for your contracts, because what clients value most in the web3 product is it's Safety. Learn some audition too

&rey: I notice also demand for people who can finish things they start.

Ar: Actually I am also not prof, but I am currently in a road I just described. Would appreciate more opinions and sharing too (reply to 126635)

&rey: –ê–∑–∞–º–∞—Ç: What should the request at Tonconsole invoice endpoint look like?  I get 400 Bad request Idk

&rey: You are using outdated instruction. Please don't do that. Instead, you can add testnet wallet at main menu where wallets are added in general. (reply to 126630)

Ar: the clicking is outdated? where do I switch it then? (reply to 126644)

Ar: I see only wallet management window where I can add wallets for the network chosen

&rey: You don't switch (as having test and mainnet wallets with same keys makes you send money from both), you just add a new wallet with option ~"import testnet wallet" (reply to 126645)

&rey: Have you updated Tonkeeper in the last year? (reply to 126646)

Ar: I just downloaded it

Ar: I see no import testnet, could u please send me some docs? Also Do I get you right, it works like in metamask? The account have the same addresses in testnet?

Ar: It may fix my bug, but in that case what are the addresses when I switch the netwrok by clicking in an outdated way?

2happy: https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk/issues/217  It does not work, can you give me an example? (reply to 126318)

&rey: Maybe different Tonkeeper platforms have different ways. (reply to 126650)

Ar: That's very weird, now when I search my ton-mainnet-address in testnet.tonscan I get the wallet, but with the address that I observed when switching to testnet in tonkeeper with slight modification of first symbol 0->k

Ar: that's fogin weird

&rey: You should maintain them at divergent seqnos then, or TON-carrying messages would get sent from both. (reply to 126654)

Ar: didn't get a thing of what u said sorry :)) (reply to 126657)

&rey: For one message on testnet wallet, send also one on mainnet (with parameters of your choice), and vice versa. Otherwise a certain message will be replicated over both networks, losing you some TON. (reply to 126658)

Mohamad Amin: Hello everyone, I want to create a ton deep link to transfer a specific amont of TON to a wallet with a certain comment. I read some docs and came up with this syntax:  ton://transfer/{address}?amount={amount}&text={comment}but when I open this link with tonkeeper, I can modify the comment and amount. Is there any way to modify the url so that the values are fixed and cannot be changed in application??

Antoxa: How do they connect such a payment service, maybe there is an instruction, you can only connect to the application? Alternatively, you can contact the bot so that when paying for a subscription, there are these payment methods.

&rey: It's ill-advised to disallow user to do something on their device. There's no special parameter. (reply to 126665)

&rey: It's just TON Connect 2; I sense some misconception about "payment service" / "application" / etc; what did you mean? (reply to 126666)

Ar: So to develop on TON testnet I should send messages on both mainnet and testnet? (reply to 126661)

Ar: I am not really familiar with message concept yet, but this sounds not flow-ethical

Antoxa: It can only be connected to an application where you can make payments in tone through it, or you can connect it to a bot to make payments to a paid channel. And how to go to the site or this service. (reply to 126669)

&rey: You should actually use different wallets, one which would have different mnemonics are sufficient to prevent message replication (reply to 126670)

&rey: (generally, if wallet addresses are same modulo flags and checksum, then same signatures and same transfer orders will apply)

Mohamad Amin: I want to prevent mistakes by making the link fool proof. Can I use the ‚Äòbin‚Äô value to pass the comment to the transaction? Doesn‚Äôt it make the comment unchangable? (reply to 126667)

Ar: I got the difference. Tonkeeper shows Non-bounceable address of the key, but tonscan shows the bounceable one (reply to 126674)

Ar: And the mainnet and testnet addresses for this both are different but predefined

Ar: But inthat case I'd like to know if all of these are generated from one cryptographic algorithm and one privatekey

Ar: https://ton.org/address/ here all variations can be found

Ar: That's strange guys # Contract Requests on testnet.tonscan AddressRequested->ResponseAddress * Testnet.Non-bounceable -> X * Testnet.bounceable -> Testnet.Bounceable * Mainnet.Non-bounceable -> Testnet.Bounceable * Mainnet.Bounceable -> Testnet.Non-bounceable

Tiqan: How do i top up a library cell?

Louis: Hi guys quick question for you: Will an out_msg always be an in_msg in another transaction ? Sorry for the noob question

&rey: Yes unless it is ext_out_msg (log). (reply to 126690)

&rey: That is, TON guarantees message delivery.

Louis: Thanks ! So this basically means that if I want to map all the value transfers that happen in a transaction I should only consider the in_msg and not the out one as they will be value_transfer in other transactions right ? And does this also applies to jetton ?

Vadim: If you want to try what we‚Äôve got , please try our game : https://t.me/NTPTwisterBot

Louis: And so then if I understood well the ext_out_msg are basically only in_msg right ?

Ar: I don't really get is there a wrapped TON version in TON network itself?

Alex: Can someone clarify if, in the TON network, the address for receiving TON tokens and USDT tokens is the same or if they are different?

Merlin: same (reply to 126703)

Alex: where to read this info? (reply to 126704)

Ar: I just got into the topic just after you asked (reply to 126705)

Ar: Here is a useful article by binance https://www.binance.com/fr-AF/square/post/11-28-2024-tether-announces-launch-of-usdt-on-ton-chain-via-coinet-16847581082634

Alex: This seems to be more of an announcement rather than official documentation. It highlights the launch of USDT on the TON blockchain and its potential benefits but doesn‚Äôt provide technical details or clarify if the address for TON tokens and USDT is the same. (reply to 126710)

Ar: PLease send me one too, I am just learning too (reply to 126711)

Ar: I think the answer was wrong. USDT is just a simple Jetton in terms of TON blockchain, why is it unique? It is integrated into TG. It acts as a simple Jetton, so for each walletAddress holding Jetton there is a different address to hold it and the rest is managed by jeton's  master contract. The model works just like in Solana (reply to 126711)

Ar: I think I am just getting what were u telling me. I should use two different private_keys for production and testing, because when I deploy into mainnet it automatically deploys from tied testnet too? (reply to 126674)

Ar: but what happens  when I deploy from testnet address into testnet???

Ar: what happens with tied mainnet address in mainnet?

&rey: Then message can be sent in mainnet as well. The networks are quite interoperable after all. (reply to 126723)

Tiqan: Do different rpc's make my transactions faster/slower? Or is there any way how to speed them up?

&rey: Send externals to all. The fee is only taken once by the blockchain anyways. (reply to 126757)

&rey: Order for further propagation of messages through blockchain is maintained by validators and whitepapers. The main thing spending time is cross-shard messaging, which has to wait for next masterchain block creation.

Imran: Can someone help me identify what mistake I‚Äôm making? I‚Äôm struggling to figure it out. I‚Äôm trying to deploy and install the Wallet v4r2 plugin using opcode 1 via @tonconnect/ui-react, but it‚Äôs not working as expected.  - The deploySubscription function is working fine and successfully deploying the contract.   - However, the deployAndInstallSubscription function is not working. I‚Äôm attempting to send a payload containing the opcode and subscription plugin data to my Wallet v4r2 using @tonconnect/ui-react. Instead of deploying and installing the plugin in my Wallet v4r2, it returns the TON back to my wallet.  Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

&rey: There are two facts any of which is sufficient to explain that. 1. It is impossible to do anything except send some messages (and, once per connection, authenticate user) via TON Connect 2. 2. sendTransaction(...payload) leads to internal message with that payload being sent, not an external one. Plugins are installed via external messages. (reply to 127023)

Gift: Do you own one or you are dev and you looking to work with someone who has started development? (reply to 127010)

Imran: Thank you. It‚Äôs not possible to send external message in wallet via @tonconnect/ui-react?  Which package I should use to send external message? (reply to 127025)

&rey: It's not possible to sign it appropriately. (reply to 127030)

Imran: Got it. Based on our conversation, my current understanding is that sending external messages from a wallet without the secret key isn't possible, correct? (reply to 127031)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Correct (reply to 127034)

User<5987561572>: getting this error while integrating ton wallet :((

G: Hello, I'm looking to get some toncoin on the testnet network, following TestGrams-HOWTO document. It says to run runmethod get_pow_params in liteclient, however that method returns "account not initialized yet(cannot run any methods)" for all the testgivers.   Did anyone successfully gain testgrams from mining in the test network? And knows how to do it?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Get testnet tons here @testgiver_ton_bot (reply to 127040)

Imran: Interestingly, there seems to be no way to send an external message from a wallet without using the secret key. If a user connects their wallet to my web app, why can‚Äôt I send an external message using any available package? Why is it not possible to install a plugin in the wallet without the secret key? I came across an example that demonstrates deploying and installing a plugin using the secret key. However, I‚Äôm looking for a method to achieve this without needing the secret key, where the user can simply sign the message through their wallet. Could you clarify the reason for this limitation?  Reference: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/76dfd0701714c0a316aee503c2962840acaf74ef/src/contract/wallet/WalletContractV4R2.js#L75 (reply to 127035)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Because when user connects the wallet he is not sharing private key to you. He just gives you the right to "propose" transaction for him. (reply to 127042)

G: I'm looking for enough test tons to run a test validator, is this the only option? (reply to 127041)

Tom: Sound like GPT to me (reply to 126572)

Imran: We cannot send external messages or install plugins without using the secret key, as there is no way to sign an external message directly from the user's wallet. I believe this is a missing feature in TON. Why doesn‚Äôt TON support signing external messages from the user‚Äôs wallet without requiring the secret key? Will TON add this type of feature in the future? (reply to 127044)

/B4ckSl4sh\: It would be a security disaster to share your private key with all dapps you connect your wallet to (reply to 127048)

&rey: Well one can send external message without any keys of course. They will simply not be accepted. (reply to 127048)

/B4ckSl4sh\: And installing plugins is also prohibited due to security reasons (except 1 subscription plugin that comes with walletv4r2 on github) (reply to 127048)

&rey: The signing is by definition act of proving message sender possesses an appropriate secret key, and is impossible to do without one. (reply to 127048)

Imran: If a signed message from the user's wallet cannot install a subscription plugin, how can this scenario be handled? For example, in a subscription-based web app, users need to subscribe to access the service. How can a subscription plugin be installed from the web app? Asking users for their secret key is not an option‚Äîthey would never agree to it. Why is there no way to install a subscription plugin in Wallet V4R2 without requiring the secret key? How can I enable users to install a subscription plugin in their Wallet V4R2 without asking for their secret key? (reply to 127051)

Imran: Cool, I want to install official subscription plugin using @tonconnect/ui-react. (reply to 127054)

Imran: By the way, you can share an example in any programming language that installs an official subscription plugin without explicitly requiring the secret key. The example should sign the message using the user's wallet. (reply to 127061)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I think that example should probably be somewhere in tonconnect examples (reply to 127065)

Imran: I couldn't find any guide online on how to install the official subscription plugin using a user wallet-signed message.

Imran: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/76dfd0701714c0a316aee503c2962840acaf74ef/src/contract/wallet/WalletContractV4R2.js#L75

Imran: Above example is installing official subscription plugin using secret key

Imran: But not found how to install plugin using user wallet signed message

Imran: I tried to install official subscription plugin using this code but not working. (reply to 127022)

Imran: Hi @pcrafter , could you please share your thoughts on how to handle the example case? (reply to 127053)

I updated my tonkeeper mobile app recently, and one of the transactions stopped working, the request is getting ignored by tonkeeper. Other transactions in this dApp are unaffected.

Roman: Hm, i would rather start from debugging connection itself, coz i know for sure that this part of a dApp didn‚Äôt change and was working properly. When a contract call fails i can see a popup on tonkeeper, like ‚Äúsimulation failed‚Äù or i can send a transaction. This time i‚Äôm getting nothing.

&rey: Not possible. (reply to 127055)

&rey: Wallet apps DISable that explicitly. (reply to 127053)

&rey: Wallets assume they never need to subscribe.  actually, if you'd be refused a mnemonic (even frontend-only), you'd also be refused a plugin installation. (reply to 127053)

Imran: If installing a plugin requires a mnemonic, what is the practical use case for the plugin feature in Wallet v4r2? Why did TON add the subscription plugin feature in the first place? If a user‚Äôs wallet cannot install the subscription plugin (simple-subscription-plugin.fc) by signing a message, then it seems ineffective or even pointless.  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/4111fd9e3313ec17d99ca9b5b1656445b5b49d8f/func/simple-subscription-plugin.fc

&rey: Did TON? It required no blockchain changes. The plugins feature seems to be more about power users who can install them themselves. Though, the choice of architecture was lacking a bit too. (reply to 127123)

Imran: Thanks for the clarification! I see now that the plugin feature is aimed at power users, but the architecture could have been more user-friendly for broader use cases.

This is done in testnet, in case it's known that they haven't made those responses descriptive in testnet.

Valentin: If I wanted to detect if a Jetton contract has a buy or sell tax, is it doable via transaction simulation or is it better to plug an AI inspector to the verified code? Thoughts?

Valentin: yeah good point, i've done some tests and chatgpt finds the buy and sell tax pretty well that's why i'm considering it   if I were to do it with simulation, you would:  1- Find a holder of this jetton 2- Simulate a transfer to this holder to an arbitrary address  ? (reply to 127303)

fade: its possible to simulate someone else's wallet by disable signature checking, but its vulnerable to honeypot which the jetton's admin or 'special' wallets are allowed to sell

fade: some tax contract uses a dynamically defined tax value in its storage, and some is not verified (close source), AI is useless in such cases

fade: and not all tax jetton takes tax when transferring, some takes tax for swaps only, so you'll need to simulate a complete swap transaction

&rey: Just send some money to their hosting contracts. (reply to 127324)

&rey: That's pretty advanced business logic, and no one wished to share it to public yet. Because, why would they? (reply to 127309)

&rey: I'd assume that's because of comments in code, and that ChatGPT would give results worse than chance when given TVM assembly. (reply to 127305)

&rey: const error::invalid_message = 49; Tact's serialization of forward payload isn't exactly matching TEP-74, you need to add one zero bit in front of actual payload to indicate it isn't in reference. (reply to 127400)

kira: forwardPayload: rawSlice("F") you means above line of code should be modified into  forwardPayload: rawSlice("0F") am i right? (reply to 127421)

&rey: Not quite, because you need to add one bit, not 4 bits. (reply to 127423)

kira: ohh, so it's just  forwardPayload: rawSlice("0")

&rey: What do you want the forward payload to be, actually? (reply to 127425)

kira: actually i don't need the payload

kira: i just see the code in Tact documentation, and code along

&rey: rawSlice("4_") or rawSlice("0") will work fine. (reply to 127428)

Akachi: USDT is Jetton, but provided stability by Tether with the highest volume among other stable coins including USDC. Tether extends its border with new introduction of Hadron also. (reply to 126719)

Ar: Ok some additional info great, but anyways TON technically speaking address differs from the the ones of other jettons exsiting in a single account (reply to 127443)

Ar: yes or no?

Akachi: Re-entrance attack is possible in the TON also? TON doesn't hold the balance in the SC, and manage it by jetton  master SC and Wallet SC, I want to know how possible to attack and what is the resolution? (reply to 126441)

Akachi: Yes, I just want to mention that USDT launch on TON is different from other normal jetton launch on TON. :) (reply to 127444)

Richard: We are a developing a project using Jettons tokens on the TON blockchain. A vast amount of the transactions will be small amounts but the cost of small transactions with Jettons on TON is quite high as it seems to be a standard amount for all sizes of transactions rather than scaled based on the size of the transaction. Does anyone know how we can get around this high Gas fees on Jettons. What we are creating could become a huge project bringing in a lot of people into the TON network but a lot of it depends on these fees.

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: Hi, guys! In our app user can earn different tokens and withdraw them. Is it any mechanics in Ton that allows us to send tokens from our wallet to user wallet, but to have the commission paid by the user (recipient)?

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: Is it real?

pid | ton: what does it mean (reply to 127448)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: May be I can pay fees in token that I send using gasless transactions? (reply to 127455)

Ush: Do you need v5 to dev something on testnet?üòÑ (reply to 127500)

pid | ton: dev tonkeeper does it (reply to 127505)

Ush: I know. I mean only that you may need it only in specific tasks (reply to 127506)

&rey: Are those tokens made by you? That is, can custom code be used? (reply to 127455)

&rey: Well, native-TON fees are not scaled either. That ensures fairness and uniform handling of any amount and any assets, at least.  Jettons are not native to TON, the blockchain doesn't see "field in one contract's storage should decrease, same field in another contract increases" but rather "there's a chain of transactions doing certain computation". (reply to 127450)

&rey: The correct statement would be, "it is possible to write smc code incorrectly so it fails on a specific message order, in a way similar to reentrancy attack in other blockchains". You have to learn asynchronous programming to work with this topic productively, or just enumerate all permutations of incoming messages in brute-force manner; specific cases are often highlighted in chat history. (reply to 127447)

Valentin: well in any blockchain simulating a txn is not advanced logic, it should be something obvious (reply to 127419)

&rey: Well in TON you need to simulate transactions tree considering that anyone can intervene sending a parallel message that could, for instance, say to honeypot jetton wallet "for next 20 sec, any transferred jettons are burned instead". (reply to 127514)

Valentin: that's a pretty corner case, right now I just want to test without any other parallel intervention

&rey: @ton/sandbox with RemoteBlockchainStorage does that. (reply to 127516)

Valentin: ok, i'll look into it thanks

fade: The tvm emulator and its code is available here, but no one will tell you exactly how to parse the tx tree and calculate the tax percentage. AFAIK currently, there are only two parties in TON ecosystem capable of doing this. (reply to 127514)

fade: A useful resource: https://github.com/tonkeeper/tongo/blob/master/txemulator/txemulator.go

Valentin: so the difficult part of this is parsing the state of the txn after the transaction has been simulated, e.g to check the resulting balances?

Valentin: maybe another way to look at this is looking at historical txns for that jetton

fade: All you get from the emulator is a tree of transactions, and the states of contracts after the simulation.

&rey: Well actually you can simply invoke await wallet.getBalance() and await jw.getBalance(). (reply to 127522)

fade: Probably the easier way without parsing the tx tree is to run get_expected_outputs and compare the wallet's balance after simulating the swap

Valentin: interesting, I see that they recommend creating an interface of the contract class, but surprised that there's no jetton classes already built (reply to 127517)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: No. They're just on my wallet. What do you mean by "custom code"? (reply to 127509)

&rey: Jettons are special constructs over TON blockchain. They are implemented with code. Code from minter.ton.org can be used, or some custom one. (reply to 127534)

Anton: That diagram is not correct. Tact is production-ready with a security audit by a top firm (report will be available later), strong team of compiler engineers assembled together, actual projects in production, good tooling support, excellent documentation, and recognized by GitHub. It is one of the officially recommended languages by docs.ton.org. Tact not only supports high-level features like generation of serialization and deserialization routines for messages and contract state, but it also allows you to write low-level asm-functions. If you know what you are doing you can even be almost as gas-efficient as FunC and get upgradable contracts, but both of these will be much easier with the next few upcoming releases (reply to 127916)

Andrew: Yes, this is my personal understanding, and Tact is also evolving and improving (reply to 127922)

Anton: Is it an informed understanding, though? (reply to 127923)

Anton: I‚Äôm the Tact compiler lead, so that should give you an idea

Anton: That kind of diagram should be based on research so it does not spread misinformation

Andrew: ok, let me add more details and publish a new one

Leo: AFAIK it's impossible to make granular control with Tact like what FunC can do, at least currently. Btw you declare that one can write TVM assembly and upgradable contracts with Tact but the official documentation seems not agree with that; is this still under development? (reply to 127922)

Anton: The docs are lagging behind on this. Will be merged next week (reply to 127930)

Anton: You are right about total granular control at least for the current release and most likely the next one. You have some granular control

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: That's what I am trying to do, but I am not able to get the BoC from this code (reply to 128047)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: I don't know if I need this messageInner or this cell that is being awaited (which has mesageInner in it)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: I think it's neither of those, this is what I get when I console log those two: x{000010AD0100005A00000000CEA3C632007084_}  x{62002CFC71EDA9459191C3C13DAE73F7C0B579FC0F2BF35B9E7EF51D0006CB8808591CC4B40000000000000000000000000000AE42E5A4000000000000002D}   x{0EC3C86D01}    x{0EC3C86D01}     x{0EC3C86D01}      x{}      x{620012A731A3757E5840E3DF09D779CCB19C8B46A63EB65C344E80A572E236DEED07202FAF080000000000000000000000000000} ...

&rey: "Network" panel, you can see your [signed] request there, as well as response from Toncenter. (reply to 128048)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: I am not sure we understand each other, I'll try to be more detailed,  I am doing all of this (calling exact endpoint, sendBoc) because jsonRPC is not retuning a reason for status 500,  This code that I have copied is from the highload wrapper, which I have used in my microservise for TON distribution,  I don't understand which 'Network panel' can I access in this case? Same goes for toncenter, I only receive 'Request failed with status code 500' error from them (reply to 128052)

Kushagra: Hi everyone, i want to deploy mintless NFTs, can someone help me with any docs or tutorial?

&rey: Well if you can patch you should go up the hierarchy to provider.external until the point where API call is made, and log its JSON response before any parsing. (reply to 128048)

FBM: What chain do you want? (reply to 128062)

FBM: I can help you. I have experience with developing the NFT marketplace We can discuss about that in DM or here (reply to 128062)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Hm, I think I am closer to understanding but still need a little bit, I am not sure if you are telling me that I should follow into provider.external to get to the API call or if I should go back through the methods that are leading to the provider.external (I don't see any API calls there, since I am giving TonClient to provider.external through sendBatch and all the methods in between  provider.external is actually a method: external(message: Cell): Promise<void> of ContactProvider interface,  did you suggest to me to find the implemented external method and the API call inside of it? (reply to 128062)

&rey: Into. (reply to 128068)

Luke: Hi guys, I am searching for tutorials on how to use TonConnectUI to generate a transaction hash before sending that transaction to the blockchain, or an external-in message hash. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!

Tim: You can‚Äôt know hash before tx was executed on chain (reply to 128071)

Luke: How about external in message? It seems that we can build one and get its hash, but I can only find an example using keypair. I am dealing with a React task therefore I can't get a keypair. (reply to 128072)

Tim: Tonconnect returns inmsg

Luke: It is possible to get that only after sending the transaction, but I need to get it before sending :(

&rey: Once again, the only thing that can generate latter hash is blockchain; you cannot calculate it in advance. (Yet?) (reply to 128086)

Luke: with the BOC returned by await sendTransaction(....) we still cannot get the transaction hash from it?

Luke: Alright, many thanks man. Hope that TON foundation will improve this soon.

Ishnoor: const { boc } = await sendTransaction(....) const hash = bocToHash(boc)  using the above hash I am able to find tx in tonviewer its just that its diff  function bocToHash(boc: string) {    return Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(boc, 'base64'))[0].hash(0).toString('hex'); }

&rey: Usually such things occur by-design (just as EVM has its own complications leading to new methods added) with no intention of change. However, in this case, you may even be right about improvement. (reply to 128089)

Angel: Hi, @pcrafter. Can I send my tokens to multiple users at one time?

Angel: if yes, how to do it?

Luke: check this out, it might help you https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/preparing-messages#jetton-transfer (reply to 128093)

–û–ª–µ–≥: Hey people! Does anyone here know how can I get the jetton balance of smart contract in the smart contract itself. Basically I need to make a withdrawal function for jetton.

&rey: Not possible. However, there's a certain way to transfer all jettons... it is too expensive for common use but can be implemented. (reply to 128102)

–û–ª–µ–≥: How can I do this?

&rey: Send 120 jetton transfer orders, ranging from 2^119 to 2^0, in decreasing order. (To optimize costs, ensure forward amount is set to zero.)  There's a mathematical proof that it will transfer all jettons, if you need that? (reply to 128124)

–û–ª–µ–≥: Oh, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary. I‚Äôll just check the balance off chain

–û–ª–µ–≥: But thanks a lot anyway

Angel: Hi, sir, can you help me to transfer my jetton to multiple users at one time? (reply to 128125)

Angel: Do I need to build smart contract for it?

Angel: or use normal transactions several times?

&rey: I don't help with scripts for sending unwanted transfers. (reply to 128128)

ÿØ€å ÿØ€å Ÿæÿ±ÿß€åŸÖ: . (reply to 127016)

&: You can use High load wallet. Deploy it, send token to there, and distribute in one tx (reply to 128128)

D: Hi, we are looking into integrating with TON and I have some questions:  1. is ADNL required? are there any transactions that can be done only with ADNL but not via HTTP RPC? 2. does ADNL support authentication? if I run a node with ADNL, can I configure it so that only my clients can connect?

Andrew: hi, I need upgrade my contract which is written in tact. I noticed that official documentation didn‚Äôt mention that how to upgrade it. So I just want to know how to upgrade my contract. Thanks

&rey: [It's not like there are details on upgrading Tolk contracts either üòÜ] not supported IIRC; for instance, how would the added fields on contract be filled? (reply to 128184)

Anton: indeed, no native support currently, but there are some workarounds people shared here: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/27 (reply to 128184)

Andrew: thanks I will take a look. I just want to change a line code. I only learned solidity before.

Imran: Is it possible to encrypt comments in transactions when using TonConnect, given that the sender's private key is not accessible?

&rey: No. (Unless you have obtained sender's or receiver's private key by some means.) I believe you can use ton://transfer link instead, where the wallet app would have chance to offer comment encryption. (reply to 128209)

Imran: Let's say receiver's is my address. I have my account private key. I can use receiver account private key to encrypt the comment?

&rey: ECDH is symmetric... however, you generally don't have receiver's private key, that was a joke üòÄ (reply to 128211)

Imran: I think in tonconnect who connect wallet is the sender. And developer can set the receiver address in tonconnect transaction.

&rey: Ah. Yes you can encrypt that comment in backend. (reply to 128216)

Imran: I‚Äôm trying to learn about this but haven‚Äôt found any helpful resources. Could you please guide me on how to achieve it?

&rey: Well you need considerable care (for instance, if receiver's private key ends up in dApp, all money will be leaked), common sense, and some programming experience. (reply to 128218)

Imran: I understand the importance of handling things securely. Right now, I'm approaching it in a naive way.

Imran: https://github.com/toncenter/ton-wallet/blob/6aaf8fdc4daf46d17db1d1e3eec407bebf73586b/src/js/util/encryption.js#L186

Imran: We can use the encryptMessageComment function from encryption.js to encrypt the comment. I used the opcode 0x2167da4b in the cell. Is the cell-building process correct?

Imran: Let me work through it. Thanks anyway!

Daniel(""): g'night, does anyone know a websocket for tracking user transactions?
