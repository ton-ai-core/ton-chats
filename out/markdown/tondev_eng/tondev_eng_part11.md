+888: As demonstrated by the lastest Ton hack chalenge. It’s not only possible to have but to trigger parallel execution of a same smart contract using wallet v2/v3. And in a way that each line of code is executed at the same time (for example having line #313 being processed at the same time in 2 message) (reply to 148684)

&rey: That was not the case. (reply to 148685)

+888: Why can’t I post a link to the challange ? Or post any hyperlink in general ? (reply to 148686)

+888: As a way to implement mutexes. Please see questions/79625124/how-to-safely-decrease-a-variable-on-a-system-without-any-concurrency-control on StackOverflow. (reply to 148681)

&rey: OP of that thread is saying literally false things. (reply to 148690)

&rey: The chain acts as-if in each shard there is at most one transaction executed simultaneously.

&rey: Circled are the transactions (atomic units).

+888: So what about this webpage coming from the Ton validator’s developpers themselves ? (reply to 148691)

&rey: Well does it say anything about *single* transaction? (reply to 148696)

+888: Yes send two close requests for withdrawal: the easiest way is to send two messages in one transaction via wallet-v2/v3 (it supports sending up to 4 messages in one tx, however some manual scripting is required) (reply to 148698)

&rey: It must be disappointing but the whole tree had 63 transactions, not one. (reply to 148699)

&rey: It was a mess of terminology, which is nowadays more accurately said "to send two messages with one order to wallet-v3/v4".

&rey: This is a part of actual tree. And those circles were indeed executed in order, from top to down.

+888: What matters to me is the statement from the official developpers who design validator nodes that’s it’s possible to have the same line of code being run at the same time. I do care little in how it’s done (just that it’s possible to trigger it). (reply to 148700)

&rey: It is not possible to have the same line of code run multithreaded. Actually. Name two transactions (hashes, or lt+address) which interfered with storage or each other's variables.  You're welcome to hash of "better bank"'s final tree: 2c415141ea7042907dc44e0aefe806483bbf05a833657f8371582cf7970aa831. (reply to 148703)

+888: Of course since according to them it was exploited differently without using race condition. There’s no examples as a result on the blockchain. But I do notice the challenge was within a single smart contract /ton-blockchain/hack-challenge-1/tree/master/7.%20better_bank (reply to 148704)

&rey: A single smart contract — yes. A single transaction — no. Storage or variables interference — no.  It's just that a bunch of transactions left contract in "unintended" state. (reply to 148705)

+888: How are race conditions within a smart contract address supposed to happen without storage interference ? (reply to 148706)

&rey: Running this code in parallel threads in C++ is also race condition: {    lock.acquire(); *p = 1; lock.release();    } {    lock.acquire(); *p = 2; lock.release();    } since you cannot determine if p will point to 1 or 2. (reply to 148708)

+888: But this code doesn’t check balances and send funds. To me only failure to not check balances concurently allows to withdraw money as a race condition (at least within the same smart contract address) (reply to 148709)

&rey: What in fact happened, simplified:  Contract had (balance=5000.10, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5010.04, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000), msg1(to=oneself, value=4999.96), msg2(to=A, value=10). msg1 arrived. (balance=4999.95, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5009.89, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000), msg1 failed silently due to flags, msg2(to=A, value=5009.83). (reply to 148708)

&rey: @mojulie56 it is in fact important to explain correctly. If a person cannot tell data race from race condition, their claims need to be disproved.

+888: Do you mean for the hashmap. BEcause the race condition never hapenned/exploited ? And the writeup indeed talks about 2 withdrawals (so without a deposit between) (reply to 148712)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: there is supposed to be one after the other computing right?  check, subtract balance before transfer. the next check again right? just like we have in ethereum (reply to 148710)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: I see (reply to 148713)

&rey: Do you know if your solution is correct? If it is, why? If it is not, why? How would you tell?  That's why you were muted the first time by the way. (reply to 148715)

+888: The ᴏꜱ will ensure p will be updated not concurrently (serialization happens at processor 0 at least on Linux). What happens after might be a problem (reply to 148715)

&rey: I took explanation of what happened from actual blockchain tree and "aftermath" section. Would you like an explanation for first option, expected by task authors? (reply to 148714)

+888: The race condition is explained before the Aftermath section. I’m interested in the race condition not the hashmap bug (which acutally how the contract was exploited instead of triggering the race condition). (reply to 148719)

+888: The blockchain data is no indication about the race condition besides storing the vulnerable code. (reply to 148719)

&rey: Contract had (balance=5000, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5010, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A half-withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5005, A=5, B=5000), msg1(to=oneself, value=5000), msg2(to=A, value=5). msg1 did not arrive yet. A half-withdrew. (balance=0, no storage), msg3(to=A, value=5). msg1 arrived. (balance=5000, no storage). Contract deployed in initial state. (balance=5000, total_held=0). A deposited. (balance=5010, total_held=10, A=10). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=0, A=0), msg4(to=oneself, value=0), msg5(to=A, value=5010). (reply to 148720)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: this post should be explained. may be it clarify the scenario (reply to 148696)

+888: Which doesn’t match executing 2 message at the same time per the bug description (but match explorer data). A part of it should be : * withdrawal send. * message arrive * other withdrawal sent * message arrive while the previous one is still running. (reply to 148723)

&rey: Your message doesn't match statement "So if withdraw request will reach bank while all money is on the fly, bank will be insolvent during request processing", while my expansion does. (reply to 148725)

+888: Yep with a time diagram /ton-blockchain/hack-challenge-1/issues/2 (on GitHub) (reply to 148724)

&rey: For the record, do you think my explanation is correct? (reply to 148728)

+888: Not exactly.  But you did give me doubt. I understand the withdrawal requests. But the bug description definitely implies executing withdrawal requests concurently. (reply to 148729)

+888: Which isn’t what you’re talking about.

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Sorry for breaking in into your thread, but it seems you are talking about different race condition levels.  TON blockchain transaction is a “converting” by contract one incoming message into 0..N outgoing messages and modifications of contract storage data. It is atomic. Ton blockchains guarantees that two incoming messages for one contract will never be processed in parallel. No race condition is possible. That’s pcrafer says.   Problem with bank appears to exist because bank “business” transaction includes several blockchain transactions. So blockchain can’t guarantee atomicity of them all together. Contract design/logic should deal with it.

+888: No problem. But the race condition is described to happen within a single transaction… (reply to 148732)

+888: The race condition is in how withdrawal request work. The other request are required but unrelated to the bug. (reply to 148732)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: if we all agree with your post, then the question of poster is effectively solved. if two different message is sent to a contract, it get processed one after the other and never parallel. (reply to 148732)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: this is what I normally expected.   why will two different message be even processed in parallel in the first place

Torit: How do I contact a technician?

Daniel: Wdym? (reply to 148742)

NPA120: What can I help you? (reply to 148742)

+888: One way I think of is requesting the contract execution from a different shard : message would be run on the next block. (reply to 148737)

+888: I don’t known what Wallet v2/V3 is. (reply to 148737)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: you should be satisfied by now that message get processed one after the other. okay?  v2, v3 or v4 v5 etc are ton wallet versions... (reply to 148752)

Torit: There is a domain that I want to buy to my address, but it is already bought, but it has expired, the owner of it for a very long time does not prodolevayut, but I still can not buy it, support @ton_help_bot said to write to a technician that he would help to buy this domain to my address (reply to 148747)

NPA120: can you let me know that domain? (reply to 148757)

Torit: Can I write in private messages? (reply to 148758)

NPA120: sure, NP

Michaelzy: Hello guys i want to know if its possible to create a proxy contract using tact that uses a seperate contract for logic execution

Lirâ: GM from Turkey :)

&rey: It is quite complex. Why? TON has SETCODE for changing logic in-place. (reply to 148821)

Michaelzy: how does setcode work? can't find it in the docs  the reason i want to use proxy is because my logic may change in the future after an audit or changes in design (reply to 148826)

&rey: 1. Replaces contract's code cell with provided one; upon any subsequent transaction, new one will be used. 2. https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#set_code 3. Please don't expose users to unverified logic which you expect to change. (reply to 148828)

Michaelzy: it seems its not available in tact? (reply to 148829)

&rey: Well you should consider what happens to contract's data. (reply to 148830)

Michaelzy: true i'll make sure to audit first (reply to 148829)

Michaelzy: contract data doesn't change only logic will (reply to 148831)

&rey: Different compilations might expect data to be laid out in different order. (reply to 148833)

Michaelzy: okay but does this mean i cant change logic in tact directly? (reply to 148834)

Michaelzy: so i have to go ahead with proxy

&rey: Proxy doesn't seem to help in the slightest. How would it inherit data of previous contract? (reply to 148836)

Michaelzy: data and logic contracts would be seperate. when i make changes (upgrade) the logic contract, i would pass the address of the new logic contract into the data contract and then the data contract calls the methods of the new logic contract during execution (reply to 148837)

&rey: > the data contract calls the methods of the new logic contract during execution  You do remember that each cross-contract interaction is mediated by a message, changing transaction context too? (reply to 148838)

&rey: It is possible to create pseudo-proxy using dy libraries, but it would make for very unidiomatic Tact — such that any audit would reject it.

Michaelzy: don't get what you mean by changing transaction context (reply to 148839)

Michaelzy: that shouldnt affect the logic execution

&rey: Well your data contract got a message, and that started a transaction. It sends outgoing message to logic contract, and then its transaction ends.  It might be important in some cases. (reply to 148842)

Michaelzy: for an nft collection proxy, i'd simply create a logic contract that handles minting of the new nft-items

Michaelzy: ok i understand  but as long as i'm passing the require fields from the incoming message to the outgoing message it should be good? (reply to 148844)

&rey: And then how would items know to trust your logic contract? Presumably they don't know its address in advance. (reply to 148845)

&rey: Also, you cannot delegate get-methods (since there is no ability to wait for a message), which means your contract system will not be an NFT collection. Bingo.

Michaelzy: in the nft-item contract, i would have an address-type variable that stores address of the logic contract. and have a message receiver to update the address of this variable then when fucntions in the item contract are called, i'd simply run a check to make sure sender is logic contract (reply to 148847)

Michaelzy: the get methods return data from the data contract so i wouldn't need to delegate such (reply to 148848)

&rey: And any update to logic contract address would run through how many, potentially hundreds of thousands of NFTs? (reply to 148850)

Michaelzy: for instance the variables in this get function are all stored in the data contract and don't depend on the logic contract get fun get_collection_data(): CollectionData {         return CollectionData{             next_item_index: self.next_item_index,             collection_content: self.collection_content,             owner_address: self.owner         };     } (reply to 148851)

Michaelzy: ok this seems like a good concern (reply to 148852)

Michaelzy: having to send messages to each nft item to upgrade the logic contract

Michaelzy: but consider the fact that upgrades won't happen as often and most times upgrades aren't ever done

&rey: And will NFT item address be independent of logic contract? If so, what logic is there to change? (reply to 148853)

Michaelzy: it's primarily just a safe measure in case there's a bug that wasn't detected earlier (reply to 148856)

Michaelzy: yes it will be independent (reply to 148857)

Michaelzy: good morning guys Tact dev here i currently have this transaction payload in my script that sends message to my contract and it executes successfully.  const message = beginCell()     .storeUint(2016634319, 32)     .storeUint(0, 64)     .storeStringRefTail(trackData.tun3zTitle)     .storeStringRefTail(trackData.coverImage)     .endCell();  this is the message in my contract message Mint{     query_id: Int as uint64;        name: String;     image: String; }  But i want to make the name and string values optional in my contract like this  message Mint{     query_id: Int as uint64;        name: String?;     image: String?; }  how can i modify my payload to match this new message struct because old one wont work

ISMA&COIN: Hello, we applied for grants, we would like to clarify whether it is possible to receive feedback?

Andy: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/func/#convert-serialization  > All optional types are serialized as Maybe in TL-B, except for Address.  https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-types#maybe  To read more about what TL-B is, check this page: https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-language It's a little overwhelming at first, but once you begin grasping TL-B - you'll significantly level up as a TON developer, no matter the language (Func, Tact, Tolk, maybe even Fift), since it just defines how things are serialized to cells.  Specifically for your example, it's as simple as adding .storeUint(1, 1) before every .storeStringRefTail and simply .storeUint(0, 1) when there isn't a string.  You could also change to something like storeMaybeStringRefTail that'd work like `storeMaybeRef` (reply to 148935)

&: Try toncenter. (reply to 148996)

Andy: What does message mode flag +32 actually do?  As far as I understand, destroying the account sets it to uninit state, so it can be redeployed and of course such a contract stops acquiring storage fee debt.  But why would a contract that'll never be used again destroy itself? Is it just a best practice? Does it reduce blockchain storage size or something else that makes it beneficial in the long run?  Are there any use cases for redeploying a destroyed contract (except the TON Hack "use case", that is more of a vulnerability really)? Does redeploying the same account use less storage or cause any similar beneficial metrics?  Do libraries of a destroyed contract get removed?

&rey: Well if a routine (withdrawal from a complicated staking perhaps?) is complete, the contract managing it has no reason to be up. (reply to 149013)

&rey: That way, contract existence indicates that routine is still running and should not be invoked again.

Leo: And if not destroyed explicitly, the contract will owe storage fees and get destroyed sometime in the future, after which it can also be redeployed. So it's not about security.

Marous: Hello guys, I'm new to TON network. i'm trying to udnerstand how gas fees are sent/paid when sending  a transaction.             await wallet.methods.transfer({                 secretKey: keyPair.secretKey,                 toAddress: JETTON_WALLET_ADDRESS,                 amount: TonWeb.utils.toNano('0.05'),                 seqno: seqno,                 payload: await jettonWallet.createTransferBody({                     jettonAmount: TonWeb.utils.toNano('500'),                     toAddress: new TonWeb.utils.Address(WALLET2_ADDRESS),                     forwardAmount: TonWeb.utils.toNano('0.01'),                     forwardPayload: comment,                     responseAddress: walletAddress                 }),                 sendMode: 3,             }).send()         );     }  amount: TonWeb.utils.toNano('0.05'). Is this the gas fees paid ? Or the amount sent to JETTON_WALLET_ADDRESS or both ? And is there a refund ? How would that work

Slava: Gas fees are deducted from the contract's balance after it's execution, based on the amount of gas units actually used (but no more than the amount of the incoming message by default).  However, besides the gas fees there are other types of fees.  Actually, fee management is one of the most nastiest problems in TON. You should study the docs very careful and try everything for yourself. (reply to 149108)

&rey: Both, and part of that amount is forwarded to destination contract too.  Jetton wallet, in its kindness, refunds some TON to responseAddress. (reply to 149108)

Marous: If it is deducted from the contracts balance I can just put amount: 0 then ? (reply to 149110)

Slava: You are missing this part. (reply to 149110)

Slava: See this.

Marous: Got it. It won't work, I have to atleast specify the exact amount of gas fees in the amount section minimum or else the tx will revert (reply to 149114)

Slava: You should provide enough extra coins to cover all the fees for the execution of the entire transaction chain to be more precise.

&rey: "will revert" – why do you think so? (reply to 149116)

Marous: because gas fees is deducted from amount and it is 0 so th tx wont work so it will revert (reply to 149118)

&rey: The last step is faulty. (reply to 149119)

&rey: That transaction will end abruptly with out-of-gas error, no actions will be applied, and handling stops at that.

&rey: No reverting changes of prior transactions of the tree.

&rey: If other tree branches had sent some messages, those will be handled as usual – this tx has no influence on them.

Evgenii: Hello there! I am using @ton/ton library to call my contract's GET method. It used to work fine until couple of days ago. Since then I'm getting errors "failed to unpack account state".  bluepring client works just fine. tonClient4 also doesn't lead to any errors. It's only tonClient + apiKey.   All of the above is relevant for the testnet only.  Does anybody have any idea why?

Tom | OrevaApp: Hello there!   Senior TON dev needed for equity in my project with worthy compensation (UI ready, over 5K community). If interested, DM!

Bohdan: I have this error too. It's the third day of this error. I asked this question in all chats, even in orbs support but no answer yet. Will hope they fix it soon (reply to 149128)

Evgenii: In my case tonclient replacement with its 4th version saved the day. (reply to 149151)

Bohdan: Unfortunately didn't help. It's more like server side issue on orbs side. (reply to 149152)

Bohdan: The funny thing is that if I deploy some simple contract like e.g. counter and call function from this contract, it works. Weird)

XI: Hi everyone! Could you please recommend the best and up-to-date materials to learn how to write smart contracts for TON? I’m looking for practical guides, GitHub repositories, or video tutorials — anything that helped you personally to get started or go deeper. Thanks in advance!

Evgenii: old client also stopped worked for others methods. 😠 (reply to 149159)

&rey: Testnet interfaces can be quite unstable.

Bohdan: Yeah. But at least they could notify that today we have a problem, so we don't waste our time on unnecessary debugging (reply to 149168)

Bohdan: what alternatives are there except orbs?

&rey: The main Toncenter perhaps? testnet.toncenter.com

Bohdan: thank you very much. I connected toncenter to TonClient and it works. (reply to 149173)

Evgenii: I also switched to https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC - works fine

Stark: Hi can anyone share resources on connecting smart contract with oracle to trigger functions on contracts for Ton blockchain?

Andrei: Hi! Can someone please point to the example where smart contract is deployed from the wallet with pre-defined mnemonics. JS example would be perfect  To give a little more details.  I want to convert this (smart contract deployment from connected wallet) await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({                     validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes                     network: tonConnectUI.account?.chain,                     messages: [                         {                             address: address.toRawString(),                             amount: toNano('0.02').toString(),                             stateInit: stateInit.toBoc().toString('base64'),                             payload: body.toBoc().toString('base64'),                         },                     ],                 } Into the deployment from mnemonics?

Slava: https://github.com/ton-org/ton?tab=readme-ov-file#usage (reply to 149216)

Andrei: Thanks. What method from client should I use though? client.sendMessage()? (reply to 149218)

Slava: Just put your deploy message inside the messages array.

Specter MM ⚝: Hello everyone. Does anyone have a working example of processing a transaction after receiving it from the toncenter? I need to make payment acceptance in ton, but I don't really understand how to process transactions to exclude fake transfers, etc.

Nxrix: How I must create transaction for renewing a ton dns with ton connect in my web app

Nxrix: Also how can I find out the time left until the dns access will be lost

&rey: IIRC any message with sufficient TON to complete compute phase suffices. (reply to 149394)

&rey: Use get-method. (reply to 149395)

Nxrix: how much? (reply to 149396)

&rey: 0.01 or less. (reply to 149398)

Mehmet Ankara: Question to the TON Dev Community: Hi everyone 👋  I'm analyzing the wallet contract structure for Wallet V5, particularly the part where the wallet state is initialized using the following structure:  ts Kopyala Düzenle beginCell()   .storeBit(config.signatureAllowed)   .storeUint(config.seqno, 32)   .storeUint(config.walletId, 32)   .storeBuffer(config.publicKey, 32)   .storeDict(config.extensions, Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256), Dictionary.Values.BigInt(1))   .endCell(); I have a question regarding the config.walletId value.  🧠 What exactly is walletId (also referred to as subwallet_id) supposed to represent in this context?  And more specifically:  👉 What value does the official Telegram Wallet (W5) use for walletId when deploying user wallets?  Is it always the same hardcoded value for all users, or is it dynamically derived per user or key?  Any clarification or pointers to where this is defined (FunC or deployment logic) would be much appreciated 🙏  Thanks in advance!

Slava: Having unpredictable walletId will make your wallet (seed phrase) incompatible with other wallet software. (reply to 149486)

Slava: What's that? (reply to 149486)

Mehmet Ankara: So how can I import a wallet with the same address as the memoric list? (reply to 149487)

Slava: You can call the get_subwallet_id on the deployed wallet contract to determine the ID used.

Mehmet Ankara: thank you i will try (reply to 149491)
