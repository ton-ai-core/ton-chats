+888: As demonstrated by the lastest Ton hack chalenge. It‚Äôs not only possible to have but to trigger parallel execution of a same smart contract using wallet v2/v3. And in a way that each line of code is executed at the same time (for example having line #313 being processed at the same time in 2 message) (reply to 148684)

&rey: That was not the case. (reply to 148685)

+888: Why can‚Äôt I post a link to the challange‚ÄØ? Or post any hyperlink in general‚ÄØ? (reply to 148686)

+888: As a way to implement mutexes. Please see questions/79625124/how-to-safely-decrease-a-variable-on-a-system-without-any-concurrency-control on StackOverflow. (reply to 148681)

&rey: OP of that thread is saying literally false things. (reply to 148690)

&rey: The chain acts as-if in each shard there is at most one transaction executed simultaneously.

&rey: Circled are the transactions (atomic units).

+888: So what about this webpage coming from the Ton validator‚Äôs developpers themselves‚ÄØ? (reply to 148691)

&rey: Well does it say anything about *single* transaction? (reply to 148696)

+888: Yes send two close requests for withdrawal: the easiest way is to send two messages in one transaction via wallet-v2/v3 (it supports sending up to 4 messages in one tx, however some manual scripting is required) (reply to 148698)

&rey: It must be disappointing but the whole tree had 63 transactions, not one. (reply to 148699)

&rey: It was a mess of terminology, which is nowadays more accurately said "to send two messages with one order to wallet-v3/v4".

&rey: This is a part of actual tree. And those circles were indeed executed in order, from top to down.

+888: What matters to me is the statement from the official developpers who design validator nodes that‚Äôs it‚Äôs possible to have the same line of code being run at the same time. I do care little in how it‚Äôs done (just that it‚Äôs possible to trigger it). (reply to 148700)

&rey: It is not possible to have the same line of code run multithreaded. Actually. Name two transactions (hashes, or lt+address) which interfered with storage or each other's variables.  You're welcome to hash of "better bank"'s final tree: 2c415141ea7042907dc44e0aefe806483bbf05a833657f8371582cf7970aa831. (reply to 148703)

+888: Of course since according to them it was exploited differently without using race condition. There‚Äôs no examples as a result on the blockchain. But I do notice the challenge was within a single smart contract /ton-blockchain/hack-challenge-1/tree/master/7.%20better_bank (reply to 148704)

&rey: A single smart contract ‚Äî yes. A single transaction ‚Äî no. Storage or variables interference ‚Äî no.  It's just that a bunch of transactions left contract in "unintended" state. (reply to 148705)

+888: How are race conditions within a smart contract address supposed to happen without storage interference‚ÄØ? (reply to 148706)

&rey: Running this code in parallel threads in C++ is also race condition: {    lock.acquire(); *p = 1; lock.release();    } {    lock.acquire(); *p = 2; lock.release();    } since you cannot determine if p will point to 1 or 2. (reply to 148708)

+888: But this code doesn‚Äôt check balances and send funds. To me only failure to not check balances concurently allows to withdraw money as a race condition (at least within the same smart contract address) (reply to 148709)

&rey: What in fact happened, simplified:  Contract had (balance=5000.10, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5010.04, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000), msg1(to=oneself, value=4999.96), msg2(to=A, value=10). msg1 arrived. (balance=4999.95, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5009.89, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000), msg1 failed silently due to flags, msg2(to=A, value=5009.83). (reply to 148708)

&rey: @mojulie56 it is in fact important to explain correctly. If a person cannot tell data race from race condition, their claims need to be disproved.

+888: Do you mean for the hashmap. BEcause the race condition never hapenned/exploited‚ÄØ? And the writeup indeed talks about 2 withdrawals (so without a deposit between) (reply to 148712)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: there is supposed to be one after the other computing right?  check, subtract balance before transfer. the next check again right? just like we have in ethereum (reply to 148710)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: I see (reply to 148713)

&rey: Do you know if your solution is correct? If it is, why? If it is not, why? How would you tell?  That's why you were muted the first time by the way. (reply to 148715)

+888: The ·¥èÍú± will ensure p will be updated not concurrently (serialization happens at processor 0 at least on Linux). What happens after might be a problem (reply to 148715)

&rey: I took explanation of what happened from actual blockchain tree and "aftermath" section. Would you like an explanation for first option, expected by task authors? (reply to 148714)

+888: The race condition is explained before the Aftermath section. I‚Äôm interested in the race condition not the hashmap bug (which acutally how the contract was exploited instead of triggering the race condition). (reply to 148719)

+888: The blockchain data is no indication about the race condition besides storing the vulnerable code. (reply to 148719)

&rey: Contract had (balance=5000, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5010, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A half-withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5005, A=5, B=5000), msg1(to=oneself, value=5000), msg2(to=A, value=5). msg1 did not arrive yet. A half-withdrew. (balance=0, no storage), msg3(to=A, value=5). msg1 arrived. (balance=5000, no storage). Contract deployed in initial state. (balance=5000, total_held=0). A deposited. (balance=5010, total_held=10, A=10). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=0, A=0), msg4(to=oneself, value=0), msg5(to=A, value=5010). (reply to 148720)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: this post should be explained. may be it clarify the scenario (reply to 148696)

+888: Which doesn‚Äôt match executing 2 message at the same time per the bug description (but match explorer data). A part of it should be¬†: * withdrawal send. * message arrive * other withdrawal sent * message arrive while the previous one is still running. (reply to 148723)

&rey: Your message doesn't match statement "So if withdraw request will reach bank while all money is on the fly, bank will be insolvent during request processing", while my expansion does. (reply to 148725)

+888: Yep with a time diagram /ton-blockchain/hack-challenge-1/issues/2 (on GitHub) (reply to 148724)

&rey: For the record, do you think my explanation is correct? (reply to 148728)

+888: Not exactly.  But you did give me doubt. I understand the withdrawal requests. But the bug description definitely implies executing withdrawal requests concurently. (reply to 148729)

+888: Which isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre talking about.

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Sorry for breaking in into your thread, but it seems you are talking about different race condition levels.  TON blockchain transaction is a ‚Äúconverting‚Äù by contract one incoming message into 0..N outgoing messages and modifications of contract storage data. It is atomic. Ton blockchains guarantees that two incoming messages for one contract will never be processed in parallel. No race condition is possible. That‚Äôs pcrafer says.   Problem with bank appears to exist because bank ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù transaction includes several blockchain transactions. So blockchain can‚Äôt guarantee atomicity of them all together. Contract design/logic should deal with it.

+888: No problem. But the race condition is described to happen within a single transaction‚Ä¶ (reply to 148732)

+888: The race condition is in how withdrawal request work. The other request are required but unrelated to the bug. (reply to 148732)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: if we all agree with your post, then the question of poster is effectively solved. if two different message is sent to a contract, it get processed one after the other and never parallel. (reply to 148732)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: this is what I normally expected.   why will two different message be even processed in parallel in the first place

Torit: How do I contact a technician?

Daniel: Wdym? (reply to 148742)

NPA120: What can I help you? (reply to 148742)

+888: One way I think of is requesting the contract execution from a different shard : message would be run on the next block. (reply to 148737)

+888: I don‚Äôt known what Wallet v2/V3 is. (reply to 148737)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: you should be satisfied by now that message get processed one after the other. okay?  v2, v3 or v4 v5 etc are ton wallet versions... (reply to 148752)

Torit: There is a domain that I want to buy to my address, but it is already bought, but it has expired, the owner of it for a very long time does not prodolevayut, but I still can not buy it, support @ton_help_bot said to write to a technician that he would help to buy this domain to my address (reply to 148747)

NPA120: can you let me know that domain? (reply to 148757)

Torit: Can I write in private messages? (reply to 148758)

NPA120: sure, NP

Michaelzy: Hello guys i want to know if its possible to create a proxy contract using tact that uses a seperate contract for logic execution

Lir√¢: GM from Turkey :)

&rey: It is quite complex. Why? TON has SETCODE for changing logic in-place. (reply to 148821)

Michaelzy: how does setcode work? can't find it in the docs  the reason i want to use proxy is because my logic may change in the future after an audit or changes in design (reply to 148826)

&rey: 1. Replaces contract's code cell with provided one; upon any subsequent transaction, new one will be used. 2. https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#set_code 3. Please don't expose users to unverified logic which you expect to change. (reply to 148828)

Michaelzy: it seems its not available in tact? (reply to 148829)

&rey: Well you should consider what happens to contract's data. (reply to 148830)

Michaelzy: true i'll make sure to audit first (reply to 148829)

Michaelzy: contract data doesn't change only logic will (reply to 148831)

&rey: Different compilations might expect data to be laid out in different order. (reply to 148833)

Michaelzy: okay but does this mean i cant change logic in tact directly? (reply to 148834)

Michaelzy: so i have to go ahead with proxy

&rey: Proxy doesn't seem to help in the slightest. How would it inherit data of previous contract? (reply to 148836)

Michaelzy: data and logic contracts would be seperate. when i make changes (upgrade) the logic contract, i would pass the address of the new logic contract into the data contract and then the data contract calls the methods of the new logic contract during execution (reply to 148837)

&rey: > the data contract calls the methods of the new logic contract during execution  You do remember that each cross-contract interaction is mediated by a message, changing transaction context too? (reply to 148838)

&rey: It is possible to create pseudo-proxy using dy libraries, but it would make for very unidiomatic Tact ‚Äî such that any audit would reject it.

Michaelzy: don't get what you mean by changing transaction context (reply to 148839)

Michaelzy: that shouldnt affect the logic execution

&rey: Well your data contract got a message, and that started a transaction. It sends outgoing message to logic contract, and then its transaction ends.  It might be important in some cases. (reply to 148842)

Michaelzy: for an nft collection proxy, i'd simply create a logic contract that handles minting of the new nft-items

Michaelzy: ok i understand  but as long as i'm passing the require fields from the incoming message to the outgoing message it should be good? (reply to 148844)

&rey: And then how would items know to trust your logic contract? Presumably they don't know its address in advance. (reply to 148845)

&rey: Also, you cannot delegate get-methods (since there is no ability to wait for a message), which means your contract system will not be an NFT collection. Bingo.

Michaelzy: in the nft-item contract, i would have an address-type variable that stores address of the logic contract. and have a message receiver to update the address of this variable then when fucntions in the item contract are called, i'd simply run a check to make sure sender is logic contract (reply to 148847)

Michaelzy: the get methods return data from the data contract so i wouldn't need to delegate such (reply to 148848)

&rey: And any update to logic contract address would run through how many, potentially hundreds of thousands of NFTs? (reply to 148850)

Michaelzy: for instance the variables in this get function are all stored in the data contract and don't depend on the logic contract get fun get_collection_data(): CollectionData {         return CollectionData{             next_item_index: self.next_item_index,             collection_content: self.collection_content,             owner_address: self.owner         };     } (reply to 148851)

Michaelzy: ok this seems like a good concern (reply to 148852)

Michaelzy: having to send messages to each nft item to upgrade the logic contract

Michaelzy: but consider the fact that upgrades won't happen as often and most times upgrades aren't ever done

&rey: And will NFT item address be independent of logic contract? If so, what logic is there to change? (reply to 148853)

Michaelzy: it's primarily just a safe measure in case there's a bug that wasn't detected earlier (reply to 148856)

Michaelzy: yes it will be independent (reply to 148857)

Michaelzy: good morning guys Tact dev here i currently have this transaction payload in my script that sends message to my contract and it executes successfully.  const message = beginCell()     .storeUint(2016634319, 32)     .storeUint(0, 64)     .storeStringRefTail(trackData.tun3zTitle)     .storeStringRefTail(trackData.coverImage)     .endCell();  this is the message in my contract message Mint{     query_id: Int as uint64;        name: String;     image: String; }  But i want to make the name and string values optional in my contract like this  message Mint{     query_id: Int as uint64;        name: String?;     image: String?; }  how can i modify my payload to match this new message struct because old one wont work

ISMA&COIN: Hello, we applied for grants, we would like to clarify whether it is possible to receive feedback?

Andy: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/func/#convert-serialization  > All optional types are serialized as Maybe in TL-B, except for Address.  https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-types#maybe  To read more about what TL-B is, check this page: https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-language It's a little overwhelming at first, but once you begin grasping TL-B - you'll significantly level up as a TON developer, no matter the language (Func, Tact, Tolk, maybe even Fift), since it just defines how things are serialized to cells.  Specifically for your example, it's as simple as adding .storeUint(1, 1) before every .storeStringRefTail and simply .storeUint(0, 1) when there isn't a string.  You could also change to something like storeMaybeStringRefTail that'd work like `storeMaybeRef` (reply to 148935)

&: Try toncenter. (reply to 148996)

Andy: What does message mode flag +32 actually do?  As far as I understand, destroying the account sets it to uninit state, so it can be redeployed and of course such a contract stops acquiring storage fee debt.  But why would a contract that'll never be used again destroy itself? Is it just a best practice? Does it reduce blockchain storage size or something else that makes it beneficial in the long run?  Are there any use cases for redeploying a destroyed contract (except the TON Hack "use case", that is more of a vulnerability really)? Does redeploying the same account use less storage or cause any similar beneficial metrics?  Do libraries of a destroyed contract get removed?

&rey: Well if a routine (withdrawal from a complicated staking perhaps?) is complete, the contract managing it has no reason to be up. (reply to 149013)

&rey: That way, contract existence indicates that routine is still running and should not be invoked again.

Leo: And if not destroyed explicitly, the contract will owe storage fees and get destroyed sometime in the future, after which it can also be redeployed. So it's not about security.

Slava: Gas fees are deducted from the contract's balance after it's execution, based on the amount of gas units actually used (but no more than the amount of the incoming message by default).  However, besides the gas fees there are other types of fees.  Actually, fee management is one of the most nastiest problems in TON. You should study the docs very careful and try everything for yourself. (reply to 149108)

&rey: Both, and part of that amount is forwarded to destination contract too.  Jetton wallet, in its kindness, refunds some TON to responseAddress. (reply to 149108)

Marous: If it is deducted from the contracts balance I can just put amount: 0 then ? (reply to 149110)

Slava: You are missing this part. (reply to 149110)

Slava: See this.

Marous: Got it. It won't work, I have to atleast specify the exact amount of gas fees in the amount section minimum or else the tx will revert (reply to 149114)

Slava: You should provide enough extra coins to cover all the fees for the execution of the entire transaction chain to be more precise.

&rey: "will revert" ‚Äì why do you think so? (reply to 149116)

Marous: because gas fees is deducted from amount and it is 0 so th tx wont work so it will revert (reply to 149118)

&rey: The last step is faulty. (reply to 149119)

&rey: That transaction will end abruptly with out-of-gas error, no actions will be applied, and handling stops at that.

&rey: No reverting changes of prior transactions of the tree.

&rey: If other tree branches had sent some messages, those will be handled as usual ‚Äì this tx has no influence on them.

Evgenii: Hello there! I am using @ton/ton library to call my contract's GET method. It used to work fine until couple of days ago. Since then I'm getting errors "failed to unpack account state".  bluepring client works just fine. tonClient4 also doesn't lead to any errors. It's only tonClient + apiKey.   All of the above is relevant for the testnet only.  Does anybody have any idea why?

Mehmet Ankara: Question to the TON Dev Community: Hi everyone üëã  I'm analyzing the wallet contract structure for Wallet V5, particularly the part where the wallet state is initialized using the following structure:  ts Kopyala D√ºzenle beginCell()   .storeBit(config.signatureAllowed)   .storeUint(config.seqno, 32)   .storeUint(config.walletId, 32)   .storeBuffer(config.publicKey, 32)   .storeDict(config.extensions, Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256), Dictionary.Values.BigInt(1))   .endCell(); I have a question regarding the config.walletId value.  üß† What exactly is walletId (also referred to as subwallet_id) supposed to represent in this context?  And more specifically:  üëâ What value does the official Telegram Wallet (W5) use for walletId when deploying user wallets?  Is it always the same hardcoded value for all users, or is it dynamically derived per user or key?  Any clarification or pointers to where this is defined (FunC or deployment logic) would be much appreciated üôè  Thanks in advance!

Slava: Having unpredictable walletId will make your wallet (seed phrase) incompatible with other wallet software. (reply to 149486)

Slava: What's that? (reply to 149486)

Mehmet Ankara: So how can I import a wallet with the same address as the memoric list? (reply to 149487)

Slava: You can call the get_subwallet_id on the deployed wallet contract to determine the ID used.

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: this is exactly my experience too. different wallet address.  somebody should provide answer to this.

Slava: When instantiating a wallet contract's wrapper you need to provide exactly the same init data (considering the same code is used) that was used for deploying the existing wallet's smart contract. Otherwise you will get a different address.

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: v5 for example gives different address in script (reply to 149681)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: and different address in tonkeeper even though I used same phrase

Slava: Seed phrase is only a part of the init data. You need to provide all the other details exactly the same as well.

Slava: By the way, why don't you use the createFromAddress method for instantiating the wallet? Considering the wallet is already deployed‚Ä¶

.kodgen: Your wallets were not accidentally created in 2019?

&rey: What was the class of issue? Did it involve any service beyond TON Blockchain? (reply to 149954)

Slava: I want to share some important information about using TON HTTP API keys. Below are the best practices discussed with my friends at toncenter.com:  1. RPS (Requests Per Second) Limits: Each toncenter account has a limit on the number of requests. Higher tariff plans allow for more requests, enabling more users to access the application simultaneously.  2. Limiting RPS by IP Address: There is an option to limit RPS based on IP addresses. If your Web3 application exposes the API key on the client side, we strongly recommend enabling this setting. Without it, your service is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DOS) attacks from a single IP address.  3. Domain Name Restrictions (CORS): Implementing restrictions based on domain names is advisable, particularly for Web3 apps. While this measure is not foolproof, it can help prevent unauthorized use of your API key in other web applications.  4. Utilizing a Reverse Proxy: Because the above protective measures can potentially be bypassed, it's recommended not to expose your API key directly. Instead, consider setting up a reverse proxy. This will hide the key and provide you with additional ways to defend against attacks if you have the necessary resources.  5. Full Backend Solution: The most reliable solution, though not ideal for Web3 applications, is to have a complete backend setup that includes caching, request limitation, and authentication.  6. Current Challenges for Web3 Applications: For a full-fledged Web3 applications, the situation is still quite challenging. By enabling domain binding and IP-based RPS restrictions, you can potentially maintain service under normal conditions. However, in the event of a DDoS attack, there is a high likelihood of service disruption, particularly for small projects on lower tariff plans with limited RPS. This remains true even with the presence of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common attacks.  At this point, the only reliable solution I see for decentralized finance (DeFi) is to allow users to input their own endpoints and API keys within your Web3 application. Although this may negatively impact the user experience, it promotes decentralization, which comes with its own costs.

AGT: Gentlemen, is there any way to destroy the tokens transferred to the black hole address?

Jimmy: Unfortunately, tokens that end up in a "black hole" address (i.e. an address that cannot be controlled or from which funds can be extracted) cannot be destroyed or returned. A black hole in the blockchain is simply an address that does not belong to anyone, and funds sent there are lost forever. (reply to 149980)

&rey: That's quite imprecise; the TON black hole -1:ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff also disposes of any native currency sent to it (IIRC half those TON are distributed by validators and half are destroyed reducing the total stat). (reply to 149982)

AGT: But the total circulation on the chain includes this part of the tokens, right? (reply to 149982)

&rey: That's the point; it does NOT. Just like half of transaction fees are destroyed, meaning that those TON are no more. You can see that the black hole address (whose alternative spelling is Uf___________________________________________-ll) contains zero TON despite being sent some. (reply to 149987)

Jimmy: No (reply to 149987)

AGT: UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ This is the address I transferred to. (reply to 149988)

&rey: No. The t–ækens are owned by this address, but no one will ever deploy a contract there, so no one will be able to do anything with t–ækens. (reply to 149992)

AGT: Is this address a black hole address? (reply to 149993)

Jimmy: Stop deleting my information to that dude pls. (reply to 149993)

&rey: No. It is just unusable (unless SHA-256 preimage is found for all-zeros, which is harder than mining). (reply to 149994)

AGT: My tokens were issued 190,000,000 before, I transferred 1010,000,000 here, but tonscan shows that there are still 190,000,000 tokens in circulation

AGT: It seems that I was wrong, this is an irreversible mistake (reply to 149996)

&rey: Please note that black hole does not do anything to non-native tokens either (and TEP-74 jettons are fungible tokens).  TEP-74 has a special facility, burn message, which allows to permanently remove some jettons you own.

AGT: üëåüèø

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Yes. The fact that you don‚Äôt know seed (private key) from some contract that owns your jettons doesn‚Äôt mean that these jettons do not exist. The fact that nobody knows (and has no chance to know) means the same. To ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù some jettons you need to send them back to jettons master with ‚Äúburn‚Äù command. Jetton master will decrease total amount (reply to 149997)

Alula: Hello TON Dev community ‚Äî I‚Äôm with Covalent, and we‚Äôre exploring partnership and indexing opportunities on TON. Could someone point me to the right person or team to speak with?

Soon Guan: Hi all! I'm interested in understanding staking rewards per ton account  Is it possible to do the following with transactions and messages data?   1. Fetch stake/unstake movement of TON from nominators and validators  2. Identify rewards accrued for each staker (nomin/validator) after each election   3. Identify rewards of all validators in each election cycle?   Basically I want to input address X and find how much staking rewards it has received for accounting purpose

Alula: That‚Äôs a real challenge ‚Äî I found some block explorers and APIs that sort of let you pull this info, but it‚Äôs patchy at best.  That‚Äôs actually why I think a TON x Covalent partnership could be powerful.  I can get 100+ EVM wallet balances instantly with Covalent ‚Äî why not TON? Structured access to staking data, validator rewards, and onchain movements would open up a ton of use cases for devs, auditors, and infra teams. (reply to 150308)

Andrei: I think I sorted it out Thanks though (reply to 150314)

&rey: You could start with the Elector contract / reading network parameter which holds current stakes. (reply to 150308)

Dalen: Hello everyone! I'm looking for a solution for on-chain randomness on the TON blockchain. I found the Tact documentation here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-random/#randomint Is it truly secure enough for use in a production environment? Are there any other solutions available?

&rey: First, you need a specification: who commits to invoking your contract and who commits to a random number at which moment, plus to set stakes level. That will allow to make an informed choice. (reply to 150781)

Dalen: In the case of the current application I'm building, anyone can call the contract at any time, and staking is not possible. Are there any other solutions available? I found this article on Medium ‚Äî is this method truly secure for use in a production environment? https://medium.com/miki-dev/true-randomness-on-ton-blockchain-60670f455027 (reply to 150782)

&rey: This should be solved at theoretical level, subject to these two constraints: 1. User shouldn't have ability to know the number before they commit to sending message to your contact. 2. Whoever provides the last bits of entropy (when using LT, that's a validator; ECVRF doesn't provide entropy itself, just generates an unpredictable number) shouldn't be able to calculate the result after user commits to send a message, but before they commit to that entropy.

Zaidu: My project is about Ziver, a pioneering Multi-chain project meant to revolutionize and give a new meaning to cryptocurrencies.  I don't know if I am allowed but here's our whitepaper:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/16f3_po7M2OxfAUM8gaz4mbMHe12GW1ii/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=100918683306786672033&rtpof=true&sd=true  ---------    You can get all the information about this project there, and you get our progress through our telegram channel:  https://t.me/zivcoins (reply to 150797)

Dalen: does we have any example? (reply to 150786)

Dalen: I plan to implement a commit-reveal scheme for my app. However, I couldn‚Äôt find any examples of it‚Äîonly examples of randomize_lt and block skipping.   https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/security/random-number-generation (reply to 150786)

&rey: Well all primitives (that is, probably, cell_hash) are in place. (reply to 150804)

Azim: Hi everyone,  We‚Äôre building a product on the TON network and need a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) service for one of its components. I‚Äôve explored several options, and recently found a VRF solution developed by a group called Hexolabs‚Äîbut the only resource I could locate is their GitHub repository:  @github/hexolabs-web3  If you have any knowledge of the team or the company behind this project, or if you‚Äôve used their VRF service yourself, I‚Äôd be grateful for your insights. I‚Äôm especially interested in whether the project is officially recognized, whether it has undergone any audits, and any other relevant details you can share.  Thanks in advance!

&rey: I could not find the actual verified randomness function inside it. (reply to 150818)

Azim: do you have access to their contracts' code ? marked ‚Äúconfidential implementation‚Äù in their docs (reply to 150819)

&rey: Apparently it is inside EQAlanxuEMsnWh0EhV2rwfelemQZpJM8uyvN0tM62IWPzQ0L but they didn't publish that code! Though you most certainly don't want to pay that much.

&rey: I had written ECVRF impl once, at https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ecvrf-coordinator-contract/blob/master/src/ecvrf.fc, but I missed an important part of it so it needs patching.

Azim: Oh, you‚Äôre ProgramCrafter, by the way?   I‚Äôve read your work and put a lot of effort into using it.

&rey: One and the same. (reply to 150824)

Azim: What you‚Äôve accomplished is really impressive, but as you‚Äôve mentioned, some key parts are still unfinished. Do you plan to complete them? I imagine many in the community urgently need a production-ready VRF implementation on the network. @pcrafter

&rey: The oracle somewhat worked but had only one use besides me, unfortunately. Though I can complete it. (reply to 150827)

&rey: By the way I cannot attest to their knowledge of idiomatic Rust either, because they chose to change environment variables instead of configuring the logging library inside code. (reply to 150818)

Azim: So I hope we can become one of its biggest, most frequent users once you complete it. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but could we have a more detailed conversation about it? (reply to 150828)

&rey: It is open source software. Will be done soon. (reply to 150830)

Azim: So you really are finishing it‚Äîthat‚Äôs great to hear! From our earlier chat I had the impression you might have abandoned the project. I hope I can start using it very soon. Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions so patiently.

Nerses: How do DEDUST or STON.fi handle storage fees on their contracts? Who actually pays these fees? Do they deposit funds into the contracts specifically to cover storage fees, or are the stuck/unclaimed swap funds used for this purpose? Or maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding how it works and there‚Äôs a better approach? Would appreciate any clarification!

Investor: I'm building NemexCoin ‚Äì a pioneering TON-based Task-to-Earn (T2E) and wallet project focused on enabling easy Web3 access for non-crypto users. We're integrating a unique anti-rug pull mechanism to foster trust and security. Our backend is already progressing, and we're actively seeking a talented Frontend Developer to join us in a collaborative capacity to integrate key wallet components for our Telegram Mini-App:  * Wallet interface (Create/import)  * Token display (balance + USD value)  * Send/receive UI (TON + jetton) Experience with TON Connect, Web3, and mobile-first design is preferred. This is an early-stage opportunity where compensation will be token-based, with vesting tied to mutually agreed-upon project milestones. This ensures early contributors gain a significant stake in NemexCoin's shared success. If you're passionate about building for mass adoption on TON and are open to a collaborative, token-based model, please contact me directly on Telegram: @InvestorSirri"

–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤: What exactly do you want to test? If that‚Äôs something like connecting wallet or sending a transaction, you can do it on main-net, if you get your wallet app opening with prompting you to make transaction you‚Äôre good, you don‚Äôt have to send a transaction to make sure that tonconnect works, but if you want to test tonconnect integration in whole flow that‚Äôs another question (reply to 150873)

–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤: Well in most cases you don‚Äôt need to use testnet with tonconnect unless you want to test actual transactions sending or calling some contract and don‚Äôt want to spend some funds paying fees (reply to 150875)

&rey: Choose testnet in the wallet app and do connection as usual. You will see -3 chain ID in tonConnectSDK.account, while -239 stands for mainnet. (reply to 150873)

&rey: Any console output, too? (reply to 150885)

&rey: Well it shouldn't be the reason because Tonkeeper uses another bridge. Have you tried connecting another wallet then? (reply to 150889)

Jason üÜô UXUY $ETN: Hi guys how's everyone had a quick question if anybody can point me in the right direction to documentation if there's a possibility of capturing all transactions of a specific Jetton Master, meaning transactions that happened of that Jetton between various Jetton wallets without specifying the Jetton wallets via any API obviously it's easy to capture swaps from a dex but I meant all transactions that that coin has so whenever it's sent between users

&rey: Tonviewer does this IIRC, and you can see its data sources in the bottom right corner. (reply to 150897)

Ricardo: So im trying to dynamically get the blochain configuration parameter number 21, using strictly the ton core libraries, has anyone done this in JS?

Justice: I have done similar (reply to 150912)

Andersen: Hoping to ask questions related to the validator operation here, from what I understand ~2M ton is the maximum effective stake per validator currently.. Does this mean if I had say 100M TON I would need to run 50 separate validators? Do people run multiple isolated validators on one hardware deployment? as 50 separate deployments is just too much cost.

Ricardo: Do you have code example? (reply to 150920)

Justice: Not at the moment (reply to 150926)

&rey: We must hope that you do not do that; such centralization could bring down a shard if 1/3 of its validators failed. (reply to 150924)

Ricardo: In its defect, i need a dynamic way to load all of the blockchain's configuration parameters using ton/ton library

Andersen: man 2m ton per validator deployment is so low.. especially given the high specifications to run one..The ton earnings must be really high. (reply to 150928)

&rey: The underlying API call is https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/get%20config/get_config_all_getConfigAll_get; I'm not sure if there is a ready wrapper function. (reply to 150929)

Roj: Why can‚Äôt I send videos here? :(

Andersen: Hi everyone,  I‚Äôm currently working on a TON profitability calculator and would really appreciate a peer review from the community. While I‚Äôve gone through a lot of the documentation, I‚Äôm still relatively new to the ecosystem, so any feedback or pull requests would be incredibly helpful.  My top priority is ensuring that the calculations are accurate and based on reliable data sources and protocol-level parameters.  You can find the project here: https://github.com/blueprint-infrastructure/TON  Thanks in advance!

Roj: Does anyone know why this is not working?

James: The issue I kept running into has to do with the "url" value in the tonconnect-manifest.json. I coud never get it to resolve by setting the value to my local machine. Not much help, but I would start looking there. (reply to 150997)

Roj: It‚Äôs unfortunately already a publicly accessible URL. (reply to 150998)

Roj: No, that didn‚Äôt work either.

James: I was able to get it to work using Vercel. Uploaded the project, then changed that value to the URL for the vercel app. (reply to 151001)

‚∏∏ | ·¥ç·¥è Ä·¥á…¥: I'm working on launching a token through a token generator platform, and I‚Äôm looking to build a reward distribution system that activates only after a small on-chain transaction is made.  Specifically, I'm looking to:  1. Enable users to receive tokens after sending a predefined transaction (acting like an access gate).   2. Configure the transaction amount and direct it to a custom destination address.   3. Decide whether to implement this entirely on-chain (via contract logic), or partially through frontend interaction.    I‚Äôd really appreciate code samples, advice, or shared experience from anyone who's done something similar.  Thanks a lot!

Andersen: Thanks for checking, Immediate goal is to confirm the accuracy and approach, as I feel the profitability is a bit optimistic, but at the same time I think I followed all the documentation. - Hoping to get some experienced eyes on it to expose anything I did wrong.  Next step on the roadmap is to research the leading validators and compare their earnings on chain to the estimations, then deploy some validators and monitor the results comparing them with the calculator, but id like to have more confidence before capital deployment.

Andersen: Thanks for taking a look, my hope is that its accurate (reply to 151029)

.: Hi ! Can anyone help me?)  Can smart contract use method of other smart contract ?  For example:  I want to use method "get_wallet_address" / "get_jetton_data" of jetton_minter in my smart contract on FunC  Is it really ?

&rey: Retrieving them from another contract is not possible due to strong tx isolation (transaction only touches one contract). (reply to 151052)

&rey: If you have master's code+data+address as cells, on the other hand, you can do RUNVM.

&rey: e.g. https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/tvm-quirks/blob/master/ok-jetton-wallet-onchain.fc

.: Oh, I saw this code, and it‚Äôs only available method to get Jetton Wallet Address ?  I want to get Jetton Wallet Address, but this system is so hard for me)) (reply to 151055)

&rey: are you familiar with concept of code modularity? (reply to 151057)

&rey: It abstracts complexity out, leaving you to call calc_my_jetton_wallet(master_addr, master_code, master_data).

&: Smart contract cannot run getty functions of other contract. (reply to 151052)

.: I know, I saw https://gist.github.com/ProgramCrafter/53fc3a4846397ee5f3f3b25ca3356ab5 but need I to get master_code and master_data, yes?  And in which format I need to use master_code and master_data? (reply to 151059)

&rey: yes, from Tonviewer or like. (reply to 151063)

&rey: cells, just like when you put them in StateInit. It is simpler if you handle them with TS and put into contract's data. (reply to 151063)

Nerses: what is the best approach to get number of Cells and bits of contract ? also is it possible to do on chain ?

&rey: This: https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#compute_data_size. It is easier to do onchain than offchain, but more expensive. (Offchain calculation obviously costs zero.) (reply to 151068)

Nerses: In case this info will be used for storage fee calculation isnt it optimal to do that on chain, as it will be calculated just once, or that data is dynamically changing in case of storing more and more data ? (reply to 151069)

&rey: Well IF (and only if) you store more and more data, then more data will be stored. Blockchain does not force contracts to pay for transaction history; in exchange, it does not guarantee that transaction history is preserved. (reply to 151070)

Nerses: I meant in storage fee calculation is used the size of code (the logic) or the whole data that currently in contract is stored ? (reply to 151071)

&rey: Whole data. Including balance and other metadata, that is. (reply to 151072)

Nerses: thanks for clarification. So what you think of using hardcoded storage fees like in some Jetton implementations.Are there any known issues on it ? (reply to 151073)

Artem: Hi all! Does ton have a standardized way of introducing new changes to the chain like Ethereum does with EIPs? I've seen the TEPs repo, but it seems kind of incomplete with only some proposals being written. Also, it doesn't seem like the original infra left by the Telegram team long ago is documented properly either, for example I couldn't find specs for the Elector contract in any whitepaper PDFs or the proposals. How does the community and the TON Foundation manage to work on the project without an actualized spec of the network? üòÖ

&rey: I have heard TON Studio has internal documentation and test harness. Something may also be in audit reports for those fundamental smart contracts. (reply to 151108)

Artem: True, Certik's report and article do have some info about the elector contract, but I mentioned it just as an example. Would I be right to assume then that the chain development is mostly discussed within the TON Foundation itself, as well as github issues and tonresear.ch? Meaning there isn't a properly formalized mechanism being used for publishing upgrade specs etc (reply to 151109)

BizX: Hey, are you looking for dev? (reply to 149045)

Ricardo: Hey guys, im getting:  Error: grams overflow  when calling emulateMessageToWallet using '@ton-api/client' dependency, what does that mean?

Ricardo: problem solved, thank you (reply to 151116)

Ricardo: On another note, How likely is it that TON blockchain will change its configuration parameter number 21? what would it take to make such a change?

Ricardo: I have been trying to dynamically fetch the configuration parameter number 21 that dictates computation costs, i know i can do it with @ton-api/client, but i cant use that client, i can only use TonClient from @ton/ton npm package. Also how is this parameter stored in the blockchain? is it like a contract address?

&rey: Probably yet another order of magnitude of adopters, or TON going much up. So it is likely to happen at some moment but not in near future. (reply to 151119)

&rey: in The Config fundamental smart contract. (reply to 151120)

Ro: Is it possible to retrieve current API request usage statistics for tokens from TONCenter and TONConsole.com? Are there any unofficial APIs or alternative methods available for this? I'm looking for programmatic access to this usage data.

Waterso: Hi, do anyone know about how protocols like STON.fi, DeDust.io, or other service handle transaction syncing.  - Use public APIs like getTransactions from toncenter or TONAPI? - Run their own indexer synced from public liteservers? - Run their own liteserver?  What‚Äôs generally recommended for syncing transactions in production environments.

&rey: You mean the DEX part? It is inside the chain itself, binding validators to run the protocols. (reply to 151177)

Waterso: I mean the off-chain infrastructure used by them.  To improve user experience, I assume they don‚Äôt rely only on calling get method. For example, they provide APIs (some even GraphQL) and offer stats and analytics features.  I‚Äôm curious how they sync all this data from the chain in production environments. (reply to 151179)

Artem: The config and elector contracts are mentioned in the TON bug bounty but it'd be pretty hard to work on them considering that there are two different versions of each. From what I gathered the new versions were written based on the comments from the Phase 1 audit, which doesn't seem to be published anywhere. Trying to report anything related to these contracts would probably be closed as N/A since it has already been reported in Certik's audit :P  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/bug-bounty

&rey: 1. Obviously yes. I'd even say that you cannot create any liquidity pools nor add anything before creation (if you're not using something something presale which handles all of that automatically). (reply to 151761)

&rey: 2. To my knowledge, creating liquidity pool is trustless, can just be done on ston.fi / dedust.io. Does that fail for you?

Teers k üêæ: I guess it's not telegram ads team chat and there is low chance there is any of tg ad agent is there (reply to 152054)

Teers k üêæ: Make sure that you writed api key perfectly and request is going fully. Or just do request manually without programming like curl (reply to 152058)

ARCH | Basti: I'm just using blueprint instructions:  npx blueprint run --custom <rpc_endpoint> --custom-version v2 --custom-type testnet --custom-key <API_KEY>

ARCH | Basti: the api key I generated is for testnet..

ARCH | Basti: I also pasted the api key in the existing openapi docs for json rpc v2 and got the same error

pictro: I'm looking for a partner to work with. (ü•áPlease don't have any Ukraine connections, and please connect me with a lot of people who know a bit about code.) What I'm offering is a partnership where I handle all my work and client communication through an Upwork account that I open in your name. You don't have to manage or hire anyone. Just provide me with a verified account and I'll handle the rest.  In return, you get a percentage of the revenue without having to directly participate in the project itself. It's kind of like passive income.  I totally understand if you don't want to do this, but I wanted to make this clear in case things change. Please DM me in any way you can. Thanks so much for your time!  Thank you.

So let's say I give you an account to work under... if my tax rate is 45% with state and federal income taxes, and then I'm also going to be liable if you scam people or don't finish jobs, how much of the revenue percentage are you going to give me?

Lase: Sorry, ton wallet account (reply to 152178)

&rey: Then, you should check version + settings. Also, if there were funds on v4, TK detects that and uses it first. (reply to 152180)

Lase: Everything works for v5 perfectly (reply to 152181)

Lase: But they said beginners should start from v5, which is what i am doing

Lase: I used different mnemonic . But would get a different address for w5 compared wot whats on tonkeeper

Carlos: Hi, why am i getting this on toncenter api, my api really exists  {   "ok": false,   "error": "API key does not exist",   "code": 401 }

Carlos: if api_key param is removed, it would return 429 (rate limit) instead of 401. Toncenter by default allows request if not limited, if rate limit is present then it checks for api key param/header (which is the case) so it keeps returning 401 for me (reply to 152191)

Joseph: Help me understand the difference between Ton space wallet V4R2 and V5?

&rey: v3r2: base wallet which can send up to 4 messages in a single transfer order v5: advanced wallet with up to 255 messages an order, support from providing gas outside ("gasless transactions"), support for plugins  v4r2: as of now, kinda base wallet, similar to v3r2 but more expensive in fees (though supports plugins too) (reply to 152202)

Always Polite: Its different contract address not official (reply to 152310)

&rey: To obtain an expired TON DNS domain (actually, start a week-long auction on it), you must:  Obtain NFT address ‚Äî e.g. by entering <domain>.ton.resolve-contract.ton in an explorer. Obtain required amount in nanoTON, perhaps checking current price for a same-length domain.

Devsyn: Because I wouldn't like to create all the logic for a wallet software. I don't want to recreate the wheel. I noticed if I use TonConnect, the user would be redirected to confirm a transaction on the wallet he connected. I would like to let he do confirmations etc inside my app.

Devsyn: But I don't know if there is something that turns this possible on TON

Devsyn: Otherwise I'll need to create a logic like a wallet

&rey: Perhaps you want that user confirms requests of your app inside that app itself? (reply to 152816)

Devsyn: Yes, exactly hahaha (reply to 152820)

&rey: Then you would be best removing TC2 and creating your own module, @ton/ton-based, providing sendTransaction method.  DO NOT import existing mnemonics for users, in name of security. Generate a new wallet, store its keypair on frontend (preferably with some recovery option but I'm not sure which) and make user deposit a bit there; then, your app will be able to spend with JS. (reply to 152821)

&rey: Or perhaps you want a payment channel? It is very similar in nature.

Devsyn: Ok (reply to 152822)

Devsyn: Maybe, I'm still exploring TON ecosystem (reply to 152823)

Devsyn: I don't know how payment channels works yet

Devsyn: But the thing is: I want the user to confirm transactions without the need to leave the app, otherwise it would break all the UX

Devsyn: I think the only way to turn this possible is letting the user import/create a wallet. But I am not sure yet ü•≤ (reply to 152827)

&rey: Please DO NOT import. Generate a new keypair using @ton/crypto. (reply to 152828)

Devsyn: Yes, I think I'm going to use this method. (reply to 152830)

Devsyn: Thanks for your help! ü´∂

M: Hey ! I'm trying to understand bounced messages and when does a message produces a bounce. If it can do it in every phase (compute phase , action phase )??  Let's suppose I'm sending jettons from jeton-wallet A to jetton-wallet B. If the message fails in the first compute phase, ie in wallet A execution of the code there will be a bounce message to the originating sender address  if the internal message was marked as bounceable??  If the message fails in action phase in wallet A (when sending raw message to wallet B ) there will be a bounce message to the originating sender address if the message was marked as bounceable? or to wallet A?   Once the message arrives to jetton- wallet B and the transaction fails in compute phase that message will bounce if the original message was marked as bounceable?  thanks in advance

M: my understanding is that bounces only happen in compute phase but there's a special case where they can happen in action phase when using  SEND_MODE_BOUNCE_ON_ACTION_FAIL  as mode is that correct?

Mary: Hello I made a nft collection that uses the 0062-nft-standard on ton testnet network(for now) What i want to make is a smart contract using tact language (using blueprint (npm create ton@latest)) That will take a fee from the user + mint a nft on that collection with the data i need and send the nft to the user (and send the remaining amount to my wallet) But i cant figure out how to mint nft on the collection It seems like the smart contract should be the owner of the nft collection which i can do But even after that, i cant mint a working nft_item on the collection using tact language and the smart contract I have done some stuff on the testnet and i can provide the transaction links to you in your direct if you want to check them Can you guide me?

Spyder: What is wrapped Ton

&rey: The name for any TEP-74 jetton which can be interconverted with TON 1:1 modulo fees. Used to unify asset handling in complex systems, and so that actual value cannot be burned for computation.  If you received a jetton, even calling itself "wrapped TON", unprompted, then it might be scam. (reply to 152927)

Litinski: Hi everyone! Guys, please tell me if anyone has encountered a similar problem the essence is that when focusing on input the whole page is re-rendered and it happens only on IOS  I bet that this is somehow related to the fact that I use "reactive" libs like rxjs and at the moment when the keyboard should appear the viewport is triggered which causes the re-rendering of components that are the pipelines for streams which in turn triggers the re-rendering of everything else, but why is this happening? keyboard should appear, the viewport is triggered which causes the re-rendering of the components that are bundling for streams which in turn triggers the re-rendering of everything else but why this works for androids I don't understand  any ideas would be appreciated.

Nerses: While doing Jetton transfer in Blueprint sandbox can forwardPayload be specified ?

&rey: You should construct the message yourself. Please refer to TEP-74 over existing examples since they have fragile behavior over forwardPayload's tag bit.  ... forward_ton_amount:(VarUInteger 16) forward_payload:(Either Cell ^Cell) = ...  means that, after specifying the amount, you must store either 0 (and then forward payload inline, if any), or 1 and a reference.

&rey: I recommend that you do not use whatever suggested you the current SendParameters, and I'll now send a better option.  I assume you do not need a comment in forward payload? (reply to 153840)

Syv: Greetings everybody

Ackermann: Please I need help, does anyone know how to convert a pubkey to a uint256 pub key. I want to integrate payload for my contract abd that's needed

&rey: You could probably just storeBuffer? (reply to 153954)

Ackermann: I do not understand (reply to 153955)

&rey: Which language, what's the type of public key you have, which type do you want to get? (reply to 153956)

Ackermann: tact (reply to 153958)

&rey: (TypeScript, Buffer, Builder) ‚Äì> builder.storeBuffer(k) (reply to 153958)

&rey: (Tact, ?, ?) (reply to 153959)

Ackermann: i have a ED25519 Public-Key   trying to convert to uint256

&rey: But Tact does not have "ED25519PublicKey" type. What's the type which you have, in a variable that is?  If you haven't decided, you can store publicKey: Int as uint256 and then it won't be problem on Tact side. (reply to 153963)

Ackermann: I know tact doesn't

Ackermann: It's off chain, i neeed it to sign payload and send to the contract in order to use the check_signature() method

Ackermann: This is how i want to store it, now how do i generate a uint256 pub key (reply to 153964)

Syv: Hi, does ton currently have a social thats fully blockchain based like zora yet?

&rey: I don't know of such, if https://ton.app/social does not contain one. (reply to 153983)

Syv: they are fake, they all use central servers. maybe ton for auth and thats it (reply to 153984)

&rey: Well TON whitepaper contained a whole section saying that implementing a social app inside blockchain is too costly therefore all the other infrastructure parts are justified too. (reply to 153985)

Syv: i think that being costly is part of being immune to bots (reply to 153986)

&rey: More costly than that. After all, you would replicate all the social network mechanisms ‚Äî either on client, which has ultimately limited vision into blockchain (because of network bandwith), or on four hundred validators. The load is increasing hundredfold over what networks do. (reply to 153987)

Syv: Yeah your absolutely right on that one, scalability is a big issue here

crypvolk: this is TON in my Telegram settings (My TON), and not in the wallet app, just to clarify

&rey: There is no one in this chat who can help you with custodial services like Telegram Wallet. Please mind that people who would DM you are most often scam. (reply to 154161)

crypvolk: didn't refer to you as custodial support, nor is it necessary? (reply to 154165)

&rey: If there is some amount of TON and they are not in blockchain on your wallet contract, then they are held by a custodian. Telegram, apparently. And then we go to step one, which is, only Telegram can say what to do with those. (reply to 154163)

Code: I just heard of Tolk‚Ä¶ so there‚Äôs now both Tolk and Tact?   Which one do you guys recommend I use as a new TON dev?

Gustavo: So many attackers I'm also suffering a scam ü•π (reply to 154494)

&rey: IMHO Tolk is better in that does not mask the blockchain-related parts. Tact does, and it works until it comes back to bite you (e.g. if you forget that you cannot call get-methods of other contracts). (reply to 154558)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Does it matter, transaction-duration-vise, if I use TON from Japan? There're some nodes here, are they going to produce blocks in a lagging-behind-way because of the big ping with Europe where most nodes are located?

5b 44 43 54 5d: C# (reply to 154627)

&rey: Other than some milliseconds to receive your external message, it will work the same. After all, connection to you is no longer required to compute all the transactions. (reply to 154638)

&rey: if you know the list of features beforehand, you should also check out Rust (reply to 154627)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: The miliseconds you're talking about are the ping from me to the closest validator/liteserver? (reply to 154640)

&rey: To the main bulk of them, I would say. If you're sending the external to a Japanese server, it still has to be broadcasted in the overlay. (reply to 154642)

&rey: Essentially, the external needs to meet collator/validator producing one of the next blocks. More often than not, this node will be in Europe as the main bunch of them is.

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: From my observations, the collator is queued in a first-in-first-out way so I get a sense that it'd suck to send externals from Japan

&rey: Did you check message stats in practice, though?

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: message stats? (reply to 154646)

&rey: Time to mempool (though that is imprecise because Tonapi only checks at their nodes which are not in Japan), time to inclusion (even less precise because of block interval), drop rate. (reply to 154647)

Combot: Combot has warned Maxey Liu (1/3) Reason: Word **** is not allowed

Maxey: Hi TON developers! üëã I recently built a Role Authority System for TON smart contracts using Tolk, and I‚Äôd love to get your feedback!  üí° Key Features: - Supports up to 256 roles for permission control, using efficient bitmask operations (inspired by Solmate)  - Permission check passes if any of the following is true:     1. The opcode is public (Public Capability)     2. The caller has the required role (Role Capability)     3. The caller is the contract owner  - Two-step ownership transfer with a built-in timelock for added security  ‚ùì Why I built this: Since 2023, I‚Äôve been building on TON and found myself rewriting similar permission logic and tests again and again.   This module aims to solve that by making permission control more standardized, efficient, and secure.  ‚≠êÔ∏è GitHub Repo: https://github.com/ipromise2324/tolk-auth  Happy to chat more if you have questions üí¨

MBA: Hey guys I am trying to create a LiteClientApi using c# the only resources I found was TonSdk.Net and I think they don't support trust checks for liteservers. I wanted to know is it necessary to do trust checks and proof checks for different adnl responses from liteservers or I can trust official liteservers (https://ton .org/global.config .json) and their responses?  And how can I be sure that account state and list of transactions a liteserver is giving to me can be trusted?

&rey: Generally speaking, you should not. What if key got leaked? (reply to 154852)

&rey: The easiest way IMO would be by reimplementing pytoniq.

MBA: So what is the best way to trace an account on blockchain and be sure that the data I am getting is 100% correct? I want to trace events being emitted in tact contracts and also some other transactions to check if I really received x amount of y token/ton. (reply to 154854)

Lase: So guys

Lase: I have finally understood building smart contracts with TACT and i am integrating it with react.  Whilst testing with jest, i could check transactions and verify them, see dump or emits.  But in the real client (the max i get is hash or an unclear message)

Lase: My main question: How do i verify that a transaction went through or failed. Or is still pending? (reply to 155022)

Lase: The best i could think of was using a getter and polling for 10s. Seems bad to me.  What do you all think i should do? (reply to 155023)

&rey: For backend or frontend? (reply to 155023)

Lase: I am trying to do it on frontend (reply to 155034)

&rey: Well the common way is to send transactions which never fail dynamically.

Lase: How? (reply to 155037)

&rey: Check invariants before sending.

&rey: Generally, you could track down all actions from the external. That is complicated if user sent 255 requests to your contracts at once.

Lase: Exactly (reply to 155040)

Lase: Did this (reply to 155039)

Lase: However, in frontend. My goal is to tell user: loading, failed or successfully here

&rey: TC2 returns an external. You can obtain its normalized hash.  Until that hash appeared onchain, the result is "loading"/"pending". When it appeared, "will complete sometime".

Lase: Nice (reply to 155045)

&rey: Then, you have to define what effect you're looking for, to even say what "success" is ‚Äì e.g. if jetton transfer notification is not handled, is it OK?

Lase: So. I should get hash before transaction.  Wait for it to appear on the list of transactions,  Then check the contract if my jettonWalletChild was deployed

Lase: This correct/possible? (reply to 155048)

Vadim: Hi, could someone please advise on the quickest way to detect when a transaction is completed? I tried using the TON Center API (/getTransaction), but there seems to be a 5‚Äì10 second delay after the transaction actually completes before it's returned.

Vadim: Thanks. I‚Äôll check, but suppose /getTransaction does the same. (reply to 155126)

Teers k üêæ: Is it possible to add my own .tlds to tonsite:// ?

&rey: That could be delay for block to be signed after generation, and then sent to Toncenter's liteservers. (reply to 155106)

Vadim: I see, thanks. Is there any way to mitigate this delay? For example, is it possible to get a block that has been created but not yet signed? (reply to 155139)

&rey: That's a risk in terms that an alternative block-candidate might be signed then. Anyway, it probs requires you to be one of the validators. (reply to 155141)

Heydar: and it's not a blockchain's goal. (or better to say: not contract's goal)

–õ–µ—à–∞: It isnt problem of ton blockchain

–õ–µ—à–∞: Every smartcontract in every blockchain have right to dont publish their code

Heydar: Absolutely your right sir, thanks Im saying that, because so many DEXs, and other platforms have this road ... and they are hiding their smart contract codes :)) (reply to 155171)

Andrey: When smart contract is executed there is no func code. If you really want to verify a smart contract code you must inspect their bytecode. Most reliable way is to decompile it yourself, however you can use tools like ton verifier: https://verifier.ton.org/Ef9P69sU4AgSWniwHUGts1BYTIyYPVlUCN-2Vb1BmeRxW1sl, or view disassembled code in tonviewer (reply to 155164)

Heydar: is that an official way to detect the real code(Open source project?), or it's just some tools by third party invented? (reply to 155181)

Andrey: If you look at their github, they‚Äôre part of ton-blockchain org. I guess this makes them official. The most reliable way is to still validate smart contract yourself before sending money to it (reply to 155184)

Heydar: thanks, I dont think so, Im looking ...  but how by myself?! I cant understand that part, how I can be sure that bytecode is correctly that smart contract I need!  because I just understand FunC or Tact (reply to 155188)

Andrey: If you can contact author you can request source code, compile and ensure that it matches whatever is stored on chain. Otherwise the only way is to learn bytecode. You can search for fift and TVM instructions (reply to 155189)

Juan: Hi guys! is anyone deploying and adding liquidity contracts into STON FI router in TESTNET? I‚Äôm having a lot of problems to test they

Heydar: after so many years we have not well-decompiler for OS's byte codes üòê  so the only way is to having the source code, or using some low-precision third party tools. thank you so much for the link (reply to 155190)

Andrey: No, having source code is one of possible ways. There are others, for example you can hire an expert to run security checks on smart contract. This is about estimating risk of smart contract being malicious and choosing a way to mitigate it. (reply to 155192)

Heydar: it's not 100%, you just just have to writing tests , and it's never 100% proofing even on clear source codes you forgot some edge cases too. (reply to 155195)

MemoryGrinder: Hello, I try to use the getTransactions endpoint of the rpc http api While it does give me the latest transaction, I can't manage to get it working when passing a hash, LT and to_lt parameters Can you please explain what values should I input ?   I used the transaction hash of a tx before the one that I try to retrieve and a to_lt way after However I get this error :     "ok": false,     "error": "LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot locate transaction in block with specified logical time",     "code": 500 }

Danila: Hey guys. Probably you can help me. Why bounced incoming transaction decreases my balance?  Steps to reproduce: 1. Deposit 0.03 TON to a new address A 2. Get spam incoming transaction to address A 3. The transaction is bounced 4. Balance of address A is decreased by 0.000000002 TON  Address: UQDQJ7vS5zl-vfAGzmVeoKtI9dbeARnZr7GwJQIKE8RUog1r

Gyorgy: If you look at the transaction, it makes it seem like you sent it and the explorer is showing the fee being deducted from you. But it‚Äôs actually a smart contract execution.  I think it's just an indexer / explorer display error.   It‚Äôs a tricky payload, and looks like you started a transaction that bounced and failed, while the same incoming tx also had an outgoing payload injected, which failed. (reply to 155301)

Madara: Hi guys

Madara: Tonkwallet added usdt trc20. I want to leave some deposit there so I need to know what is the commission for transfer generally?

&rey: Nothing easier: that's storage fee. (reply to 155301)

&rey: It is paid from contract's balance, not from transaction carried value, as this option is most seamless for contracts: bounced messages have a fixed value, while contract's total due including its next transaction remains constant as well.

Willy: https://tonviewer.com/UQDQJ7vS5zl-vfAGzmVeoKtI9dbeARnZr7GwJQIKE8RUog1r  I believe it really IS an explorer problem. Tonviewer seems to calculate correctly and does not subtract 0.0000002 from receiver balance (reply to 155301)

&rey: Raw blockchain happenings: (reply to 155318)

Willy: Can you explain, please, how this happens?  You mean if you spam enough you can drain any walletW5? That does not seem right. I thought gas fees must be subtracted from incoming TONs in this scenario. As in smart contract code you can see, is there enough TONs or not. In this case it is sure to be enough TONs for SC gas fee (reply to 155319)

&rey: First of all, you have an uninit address with some balance. It does not mean you have a claim to 0.03 TON. It means that you have a claim to 0.03 TON minus (storage fee rate) * (time since deposit). (reply to 155320)

Willy: Oh  You mean that the owner did not use his wallet for a long time and now his wallet needs to pay the system an additional 0.00002 fee? (and it doesn't matter who was the initiator of TX, just that time passes -> more storage fee. Just in this case it is the spam bot who was the initiator of system fees being subtracted.) (reply to 155321)

&rey: 1. You cannot use SendRemainingValue more than once. 2. Sending value: ton("0.05"), mode: SendRemainingValue is even more suspicious.  Please write down how much TON do you want to be sent each route. (reply to 155327)

Ackermann: each route is a jetton transfer of two different tokens to the same recipient, I think 0.1 ton should do for each route?

Willy: I have an additional question, if you don't mind.  Does this work almost the same with initialized contracts?  I mean if I have walletW5 and I don't use it for 1 year and then someone sends me msg -> my contract will pay some storage fee itself, right? (reply to 155321)

&rey: It might, yes. So you can write  ‚Äî nativeReserve(0, 4); ‚Äî value: ton("0.1"), mode: 0 ‚Äî value: ton("0.1"), mode: 0 ‚Äî value: 0, mode: SendRemainingBalance (reply to 155330)

ùïøùñáùñçùñêùñÜùñó: Hi bro (reply to 13813)

Nick: Issue with TON Payments Integration (Frontend-Side Problem Suspected) Hi! We're integrating TON payments into our Telegram app and have been stuck on a frustrating issue for about two weeks. Sometimes in-app purchases via TON Keeper complete successfully, but sometimes they don‚Äôt get confirmed in the app, even though the TON tokens are always deducted from the user and correctly received on our wallet.  We‚Äôve surrounded everything with logs, but the root cause is still unclear. We're now suspecting the problem is on the frontend side. We‚Äôd really appreciate if you could connect us with an experienced developer familiar with TON integrations for a consultation.  üß© Payment System Evolution & Current Flow üß± Initial Architecture: Frontend sends a request to backend.  Backend loops through user transactions via toncenter and compares tx hashes.  If the expected transaction is found ‚Üí success is returned to frontend.  üõë Problems:  Fully synchronous status check.  Inefficient search logic.  No normalized payloads, no transaction history.  Often the retry would fire before the tx appeared in toncenter, so the transaction was missed, and the purchase status was never updated.  üîÅ Then We Rebuilt the Flow: Switched from toncenter to tonapi.  Normalized payloads on frontend.  Introduced async processing using WebSockets.  Built out transaction history with statuses.  üì¶ New Flow:  Frontend sends normalized payload to backend.  Backend fetches user transaction using tonapi.  Then fetches events from that transaction.  Verifies tx details (amount, sender, recipient).  Updates purchase status.  Sends result to frontend.  üõë New Issue:  tonapi was slow in parsing transaction events.  Retry would hit timeout before events were parsed, so again, processing was aborted.  üìç Current Setup (as of now): Dropped the event-parsing step.  Flow is now:  Frontend sends normalized payload to backend.  Backend fetches user transaction using tonapi.  Verifies basic tx data (amount, sender, recipient).  Updates purchase status.  Sends confirmation to frontend.  Despite this simplification, we're still occasionally seeing purchases not processed, even though the TON is received. We're looking for someone who deeply understands the TON ecosystem, especially TON Keeper flows, tonapi, and tx indexing delays, to help us audit and fix this integration.  Let me know if you're available or can recommend someone.

Mannie: Check your dm (reply to 155467)

Odd: Can you be clear? (reply to 155467)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: hello, can I hear about tasks and projects you want to do (reply to 155467)

Adam: Dm me, and I can help you with that integration. There are better ways to confirm transactions than just using tonapi. We can confirm the hash returned by tonconnect on the chain to verify the value. Alternatively, the simplest yet most effective solution is to create a new contract for each transaction, which will never fail. However, I can audit the current flow and fix any issues if you‚Äôd like. The current flow is good, but it heavily relies on verifying payloads using tonapi. There are some improvements that can be made. One of them is to use liteserver on TON to verify transactions. It‚Äôs more efficient than using tonapi each time to verify the external message (payload). (reply to 155477)

Adam: For further audits contact me (reply to 155477)

‚Äî 2025-07-31 ‚Äî

Aru: Hi everyone!! I have a question.  What are the best practices for NFTs? On the TON blockchain, how is the permanence of NFTs ensured, and who is responsible for paying the storage fees to maintain that permanence?  For example, how long a period of storage fees does the issuer typically pay for at the time of minting? And after that period ends, is it common for users to take over the cost?  I‚Äôd like to understand the generally adopted approaches regarding this.

Anthony: Introducing the Jetton 2.0 Smart Contract  Transfers and operations with Jetton 2.0 are up to 3 times faster under heavy network load compared to jettons of the previous version.  This improvement was achieved thanks to new shardchain optimizations‚Äîthe jetton-wallet holding a user‚Äôs token balance is now always deployed in the same shardchain as the owner‚Äôs wallet. This became possible after the TON node introduced functionality to deploy smart contracts into a specific shardchain (StateInit.fixed_prefix_length).  The smart contract is a direct successor of Jetton 1.2‚Äîused for popular tokens like $NOT‚Äîwritten by the TON Core team and covered by unit tests.  We would like to thank Andrew G Kiba, a community developer who made a contribution to the contract‚Äôs design.  A Tolk-language version of the smart contract will be released later.  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/jetton-contract/tree/jetton-2.0 (forwarded from TON Core)

Patrick: Does anyone know how to transfer the entire wallet balance in tonutils-go?  I tried to transfer like this, but it fails:  balance, err := w.GetBalance(ctx, master) if err != nil {   log.Fatalln("get balance err: ", err.Error())   return }  transfer, err := w.BuildTransfer(dstAddr, balance, bounce, "")  I think the fee needs to be subtracted from the amount I'm trying to send. I'm wondering if there's a way for the fee to be automatically deducted from the amount being sent, so I don't have to manually calculate and subtract it myself.

Dmitry: use amount=0 and message mode 128 (Carry all the remaining balance of the current smart contract). don't know exact tonutils-go code, but it should not be very complex (reply to 155906)

Dmitry: usually mode=0 does exactly the same, while mode=1 means "Pay transfer fees separately from the message value". I dont' see mode=1 in your code, but maybe it's somewhere in defaults.... (reply to 155906)

Patrick: default mode is 3 (reply to 155908)

&rey: Except storage fee which messes everything up, of course. (reply to 155908)

Yuri: Hi guys! I have problem with calculating smart-contract address with StateInit (code and data). this is my code async function fetchStateInitBoc() {     let address = 'EQDr1yCktbp69_8uYOcE44_3bK0qazthAS028rzJqFve6BZe';     const ton = new TonApiClient({         baseUrl: 'https://tonapi.io',     });     let nftAddress = address     const addr = Address.parse(nftAddress);     const resp = await ton.blockchain.getBlockchainRawAccount(addr);      let si: StateInit = {         code: resp.code,         data: resp.data     };     let calculatedAddress = contractAddress(0, si)     console.log('nftAddress', calculatedAddress);     console.log('calculatedAddress', calculatedAddress);     console.log("check", calculatedAddress.toString() == Address.parse(nftAddress).toString()); }

Tony: .ton is not a tld i think

Tony: crypto wallets, smart contracts yes websites no

Tony: .ton domains are not recognized by standard DNS resolvers and won‚Äôt resolve in normal browsers without plugins or support for TON.

Tony: maybe in the future durov can register it on ICANN

Root: The server returned a Hash. (reply to 155983)

&rey: Any transaction can be accidentally lost from mempool. (reply to 155984)

&rey: You do not know that it will come to pass until the external message is accepted in the source shardchain.

misha: May be you can check transaction in ton wallet (reply to 155984)

&rey: What would be the underlying mechanism? Blockchain's transactions are public, how a wallet app would show more? (reply to 155990)

misha: If man send transaction from native lib like @ton/core, he can authorise in wallet by private key and look full info (reply to 155991)

Root: I know that a transaction might be dropped from the mempool. Apart from that, are there any other reasons on the TON blockchain that could cause a successfully broadcast transaction to fail to be included on-chain? (reply to 155991)

&rey: No other reasons. In particular, once the external message is accepted, each transaction in the tree will eventually be done. (reply to 155993)

Root: Ok,Thank you. (reply to 155994)

misha: Is there any way to protect send transaction method from mitm attack? I‚Äôm worried that attack can replace recipient address. I‚Äôm use default ton js lib for send trx

&rey: Your wallet contract will not accept message with replaced recipient because signature is invalid for such message.  There is no method to protect against someone else sending message from their own wallet, though. "Frontrunning", they name it. (reply to 155996)

I can share this idea with a developer after we've come into an agreement on how to go about it and I've weighed if he / she could be trusted and is down for a deal.

DeFi: You just have an idea. The developer has the skill. In fact, they could just take your idea, build it, and cut you out, because ideas aren't protectable IP.

Oleg: Guys, hi, who was the one who rolled out the flash loan ‚Äú flash swap‚Äù contract?

Oleg: Here is an example of implementing a flash loan contract on the TON blockchain using FunC. Keep in mind that flash loans in TON are more difficult to implement due to the asynchronous architecture, and this example demonstrates a basic approach: #include "stdlib.func";  ;; Constants const int FLASH_LOAN_OP = 0x67f4e0; ;; Unique OP-code of the operation const int FEE_RATE = 30;             ;; 0.3% fee (30 = 0.3%)  ;; Contract data structure struct Data {     slice owner_address;     int total_liquidity;     int fee_balance; }  ;; Loading data from persistent storage Data load_data() {     slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();     return [ds~load_msg_addr(), ds~load_uint(128), ds~load_uint(128)] as Data; }  ;; Saving data void save_data(Data data) {     begin_cell()         .store_slice(data.owner_address)         .store_uint(data.total_liquidity, 128)         .store_uint(data.fee_balance, 128)     .end_cell()     .set_data(); }  ;; Main function for processing incoming messages () recv_internal(slice in_msg) impure {     slice sender = in_msg~load_msg_addr();     int msg_value = in_msg~load_coins();     int op = in_msg~load_uint(32); ;; –ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∂–∞–µ–º OP-–∫–æ–¥      if (op == FLASH_LOAN_OP) {         handle_flash_loan(in_msg, sender, msg_value);     } else {         ;; –î—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏...     } }  ;; –û–±—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∞ flash loan () handle_flash_loan(slice in_msg, slice borrower, int msg_value) impure {     Data data = load_data();          int loan_amount = in_msg~load_uint(128);     cell callback = in_msg~load_ref(); ;; Callback contract          ;; Checking liquidity availability     throw_if(101, loan_amount > data.total_liquidity);          int fee = (loan_amount * FEE_RATE) / 10000;     int total_repayment = loan_amount + fee;          ;; Calculate the new balance     data.total_liquidity -= loan_amount;     save_data(data);          ;; Send the loan to the borrower     send_raw_message(         begin_cell()             .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; mode             .store_slice(borrower)             .store_coins(loan_amount)             .store_uint(0, 1)             .store_ref(callback) ;; Callback in the message body         .end_cell(),         0     );          ;; Check for refund (should be done in the callback)     ;; TON requires a separate verification mechanism }  ;; Callback for refund () repay_loan(slice sender) impure {     Data data = load_data();     int returned_amount = in_msg_body~load_coins() - get_fee();           ;; Verification of refund     throw_unless(102, returned_amount >= data.expected_repayment);          data.total_liquidity += loan_amount;     data.fee_balance += fee;     save_data(data); }  ;; Helper functions int compute_fee(int amount) method_id {     return (amount * FEE_RATE) / 10000; }  ### Key components: 1. Lending mechanism: - The borrower sends a request specifying the amount and the callback contract - The contract checks the availability of liquidity - The funds are sent to the borrower in a single transaction  2. Fees: - Fixed rate of 0.3% (FEE_RATE) - Calculated automatically when the loan is issued - Stored separately in fee_balance  3. Security: - Liquidity verification before issuance - Verification of refund in callback - Overflow protection (128-bit numbers)  ### Features of implementation in TON: 1. Asynchronous model: - No guarantee of atomicity of transactions - Requires explicit verification of return via callback - The entire loan cycle may take several blocks  2. Restrictions: - The borrower must be a contract (for handling the callback) - Pre-liquidity in the pool is required - Gas complexity is higher than in EVM  3. Return mechanism: - The callback contract must call repay_loan - Checking the amount of the return, taking into account the commission - Automatic replenishment of the liquidity pool  ### Recommendations for production: 1. Add: - Temporary restrictions on the return - White list mechanism - Pool insurance - Support for Jetton tokens  2. Test the scenarios: - Failed return of funds - Repeated login attacks - Commission calculation errors - Price changes in liquidity pools

akki: Is tps/throughput for jettons transfer is same as native ton coin?

&rey: One jetton transfer incurs around five transactions so throughput could temporarily decrease. Until shards split, that is. (reply to 156293)

akki: shard split automatic? or need to write specific code in contract what's that sharded jetton contract about in tact repo? (reply to 156294)

&rey: Automatic.  "Sharded jetton" is a tool to hinder TON's sharding (based on experimental config), rewriting a few first bits of jetton wallet address to be in the same shard to its owner. (reply to 156296)

akki: so  if I expect my jetton project to scale to billions of wallets/users should I avoid sharded jetton? if not, how this contradiction is helpful? (reply to 156297)

akki: and owner here means minter? or V4/w5 contract (reply to 156297)

&rey: Sharded jetton moves its jetton wallets towards V3R2/w5, i.e. user's wallet. (reply to 156302)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: hi, I have issue with my code, if I  run a jetton transfer with js and putting 0.15ton, it runs successfully, but on wallet apps like tonkeeper, it is unable to proceed due to unable to calculate gas estimate

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: can I add extra message into TokenTransfer receiver and also on TokenTransferInternal, this 2 additions is what is causing wallet app unable to estimate gas fee or so. but works when I use a javascript and set 0.15 ton for example,

Hon. Festus: What are you building? (reply to 156746)

&rey: Optimize the code. Why would users choose your jetton if it's that expensive to handle? How would it be placed in DEX? (reply to 156742)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: those are my worries actually.  thanks for the response.   Dex will be exempted or so. I am just not comfortable tonkeeper will just disallow a transfer cos of a little high gas fee. noticed tonkeeper for example usually use 0.05ton for jetton transfers, don't know if it does that for all jetton or go higher for some other jetton eg usdt (reply to 156759)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: all excess is actually returned back to sender at the end of the transaction anyways

&rey: How do you exempt DEXes given that some of them will appear after you deploy the jetton? After all, stonfi and dedust are only two of the bunch.  FYI, TON validators have voted and so made USDT transfers cheaper than a common jetton. (reply to 156760)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: what do you suggest I do to optimise. cos I need to check a variable from another contract before continuing other part of transaction.

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: or bounce the transaction (reply to 156764)

Leo: why your jetton consume so much gas?

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: I added extra message inside jettontransfer (reply to 156770)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: I am using Tact language for this jetton contract

Teemu | Ê©üÂô®‰∫∫ü™Ω: hey guys, is there any workaround for wallet deployment? Wallets created on tonkeeper are instadeployed, but if i create them on my app, they need to deploy manually?

&rey: They aren't instadeployed in the sense "recorded onchain as soon as it is created". If you speak of deployment on the first outgoing transfer, it should be already supported in all libraries. (reply to 156809)

Teemu | Ê©üÂô®‰∫∫ü™Ω: i just dont understand how can i do an outgoing transfer when the wallet bounces all the funds i send out üòÖ

&rey: You should provide unbounceable address (the one which starts with UQ rather than EQ) to senders. (reply to 156811)

&rey: It is nothing new at this point, unfortunately, and still not relevant to development on TON so I have removed that post. (reply to 156831)

&rey: Concerning staking... well there are different services: 1) providing TON for a validator to run, and it shares part of what it earns 2) providing some jettons for DEX liquidity, with all the "permanent/impermanent/whatever losses" 3) other services which are kind enough or trying to become popular

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: even though the transfer was successful, sender debited and receiver credited, no gas shortage, nothing.  just because the path of transaction isn't the usual path of jetton.

>_: i call get_account_state each 5sec and last_transaction_id is always the same, even though tonviewer says that there is newer transactions

&rey: Bump your tonlib-rs to the latest version which is 0.26.1 then say if it still fails.

>_: it does

>_: [dependencies] tonlib-core = "0.26.1" tonlib-client = "0.26.1"

&rey: Any network complications like provider terminating whatever connections they want?

>_: Nope, even tried with vpn - same result

&rey: Well even toncli (the official tool for loading raw chain data, which is packaged with func, fift and other executables) fails on most liteservers apparently.  Tonviewer runs their own nodes and does not suffer from the same problem.

>_: So its just servers being down rn?

üåãPr√¥: The link to join

>_: Thanks Rey. Seems like today it works much better (hovewer some servers still fail) (reply to 157172)

>_: Btw, im trying to make a tracer, and have no idea how to correctly fetch messages to build a trace. Currently what im doing is getting out_msg, iterating it and trying to find a message on destination account where in_msg isnt empty and has the same time and hash. Guess this behaviour is incorrect as sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. (Ik there are indexers, but my goal is to create a simplified version without external services)

&rey: Are you perhaps trying to find transaction that might not exist yet? (reply to 157207)

>_: probably

&rey: There is a guarantee that it will happen eventually, and not much beyond that.

&rey: By the way you should not compare "time and hash" but instead "source address and logical time of generation".

>_: so what should i do? track every further transaction and saturate previous traces? (reply to 157210)

&rey: Well that totally depends on what service you want to build. Something like that, yes. (reply to 157212)

&rey: For the reference, 1. during inscriptions epoch, there were lots of individual messages which took hours to cross shardchains 2. I have built TON Timer, working onchain, and its transactions trace can span hours.

>_: okay, will rework the approach entirely then. thank you once again!

Leo: probably you built it wrong, e.g. do you store the five flag bits in StateInit? (reply to 157107)

Leo: show the code with all details if still confused

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: So made a custom jetton with Tact days ago, doesn't follow the usual flow for jetton transfers, so tonkeeper and probably other wallet apps wont allow me transfer, "unable to calculate jetton transfer fee error" or so, but if I use js script to run it, it transfer successfully but on tonviewer, it mark as transaction failed even though it cannot state specifically what part is error üòäüòÄü§£

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: I don't think so.  U just have to deploy on mainnet. mainnet and testnet are different (reply to 157315)

akki: can't I export current state of wallet? (reply to 157322)

Leo: you can do this by replaying all related transactions on testnet, if you have control of all holder accounts

&rey: Mainnet is a blockchain on its own, why would it import anything (contract states and balances) from another one? (reply to 157323)

akki: well I was thinking it would be a good ux  if I have some project on testnet with custom minting logic  and no serious exploits happens  then I export same contract to mainnet I think tokens can be minted on mainnet by locking on test but other state replication could be tricky (reply to 157327)

Sunil: We are building a internal payments router with in our campus, and we are mapping each student with their userid "UGR07A678" and the user is mapped with a wallet id. And any payment done on this should be routed to the associated wallet,  We are looking for a contract on ton where users map their wallets with their userid , and the userid and wallet address are stored in contract. While sending funds and payments to the userid the funds are to be routed to student wallet, posibully add features to set wallet and studentid, also get the wallet address mapped for student id,¬†¬†and a final method which takes student id as argument and ton to sent, this will internally send ton to the user wallet,  Deliverable: working contract code and a sandbox demo on the complete flow as specified in sandbox.

Scilefü¶â: Since I have to write a wrapper and a deployment script, there is a few chances the problem is on the contract level. And I've deployed this contract before, it's fine (reply to 157577)

Scilefü¶â: It calculates the address and after that it says this address is invalid I suppose there is a mess with networks somewhere, I try to deploy to testnet but maybe somehow script calculate address for mainnet

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: what exactly is the issue you are having with your contract code or script

Chris: Did you deployed a few times the same contract? It would not work this way. Each deployment must have a slightly different code or parameters (therefore there is often "id" parameter in contract's constructor, to increase it with each deploy). It's because deployment address is calculated based on code and parameters. (reply to 157586)

&rey: Insufficient TON to complete the computations. BLS verification has very high cost assigned. (reply to 157795)

Ashees: Thanks, let me update it and see

Ashees: Currently I am sending 0.002 Ton. How much shall I send?    async sendVerify(provider: ContractProvider, via: Sender) {          const queryId = Date.now();          const messageBody = beginCell()              .storeUint(2, 32) // op code = 2 (verify)              .storeUint(queryId, 64)              .endCell();          await provider.internal(via, {              value: "0.002", // send 0.002 TON for gas              body: messageBody          });      } (reply to 157798)

&rey: 0.200 should be sufficient. (reply to 157800)

Ashees: Ok

Ashees: It is still failing, I redeployed the contract and also changed store_uint to store_int. But still it's failing.  https://testnet.tonscan.org/tx/97d684f78cfc874ecd53fd023f1acdc7903989a23dd34fe45293a25808adf9d2

Pem: Hi everyone. I am new to TON dev and I'm working on a dApp idea, which requires to send a message from my TON contract to SecretNetwork (Cosmos) chain, I need my Secret contract to publish a private key when and only when a specific TON contract tells it to. I have researched this a lot but the easiest way with Axelar has not been implemented with TON yet (or I could not found any doc on it) and using a third EVM chain seems like a big hassle and gas headache for me. Any insights, examples, or pointers would be really appreciated. ü§≤üôè

Code: Does anybody know about deleting smart contracts? Does it refund all gas?

&rey: Refund what, sorry? There was no special fee for deployment, and contract cannot be deleted if it has TON remaining. (reply to 158001)

Edison: Please help me

Edison: My address was called by the contract to tamper with the auction proceeds address

&rey: What resulted? (reply to 158779)

Edison: Changed the beneficiary address and auctioned my NFT

Edison: He forged a website that looked just like Frogment's, even the domain name was the same.

Edison: please

Edison: Can someone help me?

&rey: That's scam. If auction started that's not recoverable. Sending more money will serve just to lose more. (reply to 158786)

Edison: Can't I freeze this scammer's address? I checked his address and he has cheated many people.

Mr: Hello, I would like to report a fraud committed by a member of the TON team. (reply to 158822)

Mr: He introduced himself as an intern on the TON team, thus instilling trust in people. Then, Solana also came up with a project and pulled the rug.

Mr: He removed his Twitter posts.

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: you shouldn't trust the words of different users (reply to 158837)

Mr: He has the title of approved TON intern team worker. (reply to 158846)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: is there any confirmation of this on the official websites of the TON? if someone tells me that he is a member of some team, then it is usually a lie. You should always be careful when handling any information (reply to 158847)

&rey: There is confirmation of X's internal systems of who's running which account, in fact. (reply to 158848)

Mr: Dude, the guy has a TON of verified account signs on his Twitter account. (reply to 158848)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: I don't understand how X works, but I am generally skeptical about all information and recommend double-checking in different sources and on different platforms. (reply to 158849)

Code: Does anybody have a good method for finding out TX results from a highload wallet? all the docs are for regular wallets only :/, and I cant just call .getTransactions() because there could be hundreds

Code: its also not a reliable pattern because the destination address could be very hot (reply to 159074)

Anthony: ü´ß Tolk v1.1: built-in map<K,V>, enums, private and readonly fields, method overloads  Two months have passed ‚Äî maybe you even started to worry about the silence. The reason is simple: I worked on features that are "nice to have" but complex and time-consuming to implement ‚Äî and they've only just been finished.  ‚úÖ Notable changes in Tolk v1.1:  1. map<K, V> ‚Äî a convenient zero-overhead wrapper over TVM dictionaries 2. enum ‚Äî group numeric constants into a distinct type 3. private and readonly fields in structures 4. Overload resolution and partial specialization  PR on GitHub with detailed info.  ‚úî Built-in maps  Forget about uDictSetBuilder, sDictGetFirstAsRef, and the endless boilerplate of low-level dict helpers. A universal map<K,¬†V> now fully replaces them.   var m: map<int8, int32> = createEmptyMap(); m.set(1, 10); m.addIfNotExists(9, -90); m.delete(9);   // now: [ 1 => 10 ] m.exists(1);   // true m.isEmpty();   // false   Just m.get() ‚Äî no need to care about cells and slices under the hood:  val r = m.get(1); if (r.isFound) {   // true     val v = r.loadValue();  // 10 }  // or if the key 100% exists val v = m.mustGet(1);  // 10   Easily iterate forward and backward:  var r = m.findFirst(); while (r.isFound) {     // use r.getKey() and r.loadValue()     r = m.iterateNext(r); }   Any serializable keys and values ‚Äî it just works:  map<address, Point> map<Point, Cell<Extra>> map<int32, map<int64, bool>> ...   All in all: - self-explanatory methods, nicely suggested by IDEs - DICTISETREF, DICTREPLACE, DICTUREPLACEGET, ... ‚Äî 100+ asm instructions covered by the type system - all deserialization to/from cells perfectly hidden by high-level API - absolutely zero overhead compared to low-level TVM dictionaries  ‚úî Enums  A long-awaited syntax feature for grouping constants.   // will be 0 1 2 enum Color {     Red     Green     Blue }   Being integers at runtime, enums have their own place in the type system. They resemble TypeScript/C++ enums. (Unlike Rust, where each variant may have its own shape. In Tolk we have union types ‚Äî a more powerful solution)   struct Gradient {     from: Color     to: Color? = null }  var g: Gradient = { from: Color.Blue }; g.from == Color.Red;    // false   Compatible with all language features: auto-serialization, exhaustive pattern matching, generics, etc.  ‚úî Private and readonly fields  Fields can now have modifiers: * private ‚Äî accessible only within methods * readonly ‚Äî immutable after object creation   struct PosInTuple {     private readonly t: tuple     curIndex: int }  fun PosInTuple.last(mutate self) {     // `t` is visible only in methods     // and cannot be modified     self.curIndex = self.t.size() - 1; }   ‚úî Partial specialization  Now it's possible to overload methods for "more specific" implementations:   // general implementation fun Iterator<T>.next(self) { ... }  // a more specific one fun Iterator<Cell<T>>.next(self) { ... }   In complex scenarios, this feature lets you adjust the behavior of specific types while keeping a common interface. It "just works", but internally the compiler was enhanced with shape of types, structural depth, type dominators, and several heuristics.  üå≥ After Tolk v1.0 release, many people and companies started migrating from FunC to Tolk. I have received a lot of feedback and requests (and almost zero bug reports, huh). Meanwhile, a bigger roadmap is already in motion. In the near future I'll also try to close long-standing questions around TypeScript wrappers, and deliver proper from-scratch documentation. (forwarded from TOLK lang)

Khosro: Hey everyone,  I'm trying to run an entry proxy on my remote server using the rldp-http-proxy tool, and I have a couple of important questions:  1. Is the generated ADNL address tied to my remote server's IP address? In other words, if my server's IP changes, will I lose my proxy completely?  2. How can I change my server or its IP address without having to update the ADNL address in the .ton domain's DNS records?  https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-proxy-sites/running-your-own-ton-proxy

&rey: If I remember correctly, ADNL address is not bound to IP by itself, and proxy will rebroadcast each IP through DHT. (reply to 159279)

Petr: Tolk is officially recommended for development on TON, and most likely all future contracts will be written in Tolk (reply to 159225)

Code: Would love some help with making a Tolk contract upgradeable please  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/issues/1807

Petr: Check this article as a reference https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/upgrades/#_top  setCode is key here (reply to 159291)

&rey: Especially for developers who are new to the ecosystem and are likely to make mistakes in their first contract(s).  I think this is wrong mechanism to suggest to beginners, rather than redeploying contracts from scratch.

&rey: You missed Tolk vs Tact. (reply to 159292)

Petr: The principles are the same (reply to 159294)

Code: Quite seperate things, a new contract isn't possible sometimes (e.g. NFT contract)  lets say I want to add freezing functionality to my NFT contract in the future, I cant just deploy new contract (reply to 159293)

Code: Thanks Petr I will take a look, but would be nice for the dev team to improve Tolk docs in general (reply to 159295)

Petr: This is definitely planned, see the Tolk 1.1 release post (reply to 159298)

&rey: First, the NFTs you provided to users are contracts (here meaning as in "legal contracts" and not "smart contracts"): they say what can happen to them and users can rely on it. When you add freeze functionality, you are unilaterally walking back on that contract and changing it to be something else.  Upgrading is sometimes convenient, but not in all applications. There are more general solutions of exchanging old tokens to new 1:1. (reply to 159296)

&rey: Having a security bug in upgradeable contract also increases variance of outcomes.

Code: NFTs are not legal contracts lol, and also this is dev chat not legal chat, also you have no idea what im building, and it was just an example for general functionality that is very basic. All mainstream chains let you upgrade contracts and have clear guides (reply to 159300)

&rey: Well each project has choice on their relation to tokens, indeed. (It is best when it is laid out to users clearly as well.)  You sure noticed that I agree that a guide on upgrading is needed? (reply to 159302)

Code: yes yes we should just be more supportive of eachother and not attack each other haha, TON development is hard enough  I have wrote smart contracts on Both EVM and SVM and this is by far the hardest

grachzy: And what about gas? Is there a significant difference with Tact? (reply to 159290)

Petr: Yeah, it's actually much better than FunC, and Tact in some tasks is on par with FunC, in some tasks Tact a bit faster and in some a bit slower, so Tolk is better than Tact in gas üòÑ  Check this repo: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench

&rey: Neither standard actually says clearly what a Vault is meant to be. (reply to 159397)

&rey: Thus, scope of applicability is very unclear for coders. Like... would DEX developers need to read the standard? vesting contract developers? who else?

Vsevolod: TON Connect is a tool to connect wallets, private keys are stored on the local device or custodially (reply to 159364)

Vsevolod: Generation of private keys is connected with wallet creation. That process is connected more to the wallet side, not ton connect

Vsevolod: If you'd like create a wallet for user, should do that having solution for storing key

Vsevolod: Keys storage can be conducted both server and user side

Angel: Hello, does anyone know or have a repo that allows you to send two jettons in a single transaction?

Angel: The truth is, I don't know how to do that thing of sending two jettons in a single transaction.

kevin: If you mean in a single external message, that will do

&: Why not. wallet v5 can send several tx at one time. (reply to 159438)

&rey: Where are you sending from? 1. TON Connect 2: pass multiple messages to sendTransaction. 2. your favorite library handling secret key: it also defines how to create transfer order with multiple messages. 3. smart contract: call send_raw_message multiple times.  For 2 and 3, take care about mode which determines how much TON goes into each message. (reply to 159438)

&rey: Tonkeeper's definition refers to their repository https://github.com/tonkeeper/ton-assets. (reply to 159537)

&rey: Bridge failures are issues of the corresponding wallets. So if those bottom errors bother you, you can report them to, as far as I see, the CEXes. You can also verify if you can or cannot connect the CEX wallet to your own dApp. (reply to 159533)

&rey: The first one, for loading wallets list... ISP is blocking or shadow-blocking the domain perhaps?

Ateeb: Hi team I want to verify my ton reward on explorer which I have earned through staking how can I do that

Ateeb: Or any api which can help me

&rey: That totally depends on which staking service you used. Let's hope that they do have developer docs at all. (reply to 159552)

Ateeb: Let's say I am staking through bitgo platform and whatever they are telling me I have earned as reward   I want to reconcile at my end

Ateeb: Also isn't there any public explorer which can give me the exact details on reward what I have earned

&rey: It is kinda impossible to create because you cannot know what any given contract (and public explorer does not have anything beyond interaction patterns, data and code cell) does. (reply to 159557)

Ateeb: Got it then then how can I reconcile this independently

&rey: They do not seem to publish the interface for TON staking state on Github. The most certain solution would now be to take your transaction hash and trace where the funds went, and if that is a well-known contract type. (reply to 159559)

&rey: And the faster option is, of course, to ask them directly "what is the relevant smart contract and get-method name" then go verifying with that. (reply to 159552)

Ateeb: hello

Ateeb: Hi afaik there is no native way to get rewards data with smart contracts on TON. You'll need to check the difference between the amount that the pool recovers from from the elector at the end of the epoch and the amount that the pool sends at the start of the epoch. This difference is the amount earned.  this i what they have replied

Ateeb: can you help me what this mean

&rey: They are saying that their contract is a nominator pool, supporting an unspecified validator. It is quite complex but possible to calculate the reward by querying, in particular, The Elector; you'd need to know the chosen validator though.

Ateeb: can you help me with this or any formula which can help me

Shahboz: I need to create such a smart contract: If someone sends MyToken (MT) to the wallet ‚Üí the contract automatically mints sMyToken (sMT) for them.  If someone sends sMT ‚Üí the contract burns the sMT and sends back the equivalent amount of MT   In both cases, the sender must also include some TON to cover the gas fees   Is there any guide or ready-made example for this?

&: You looks like make a pumpfun style token launchpad smart contract.  DM me for more details. (reply to 159578)

Shahboz: Can you help me with this here? What exactly needs to be done to make it the way I asked? (reply to 159583)

&: I think there's no public repo. bcz there's no standard in this field.  ready-made example??? I don't think so (reply to 159584)

&: code_cowboy. I have developed the platform before and I have researched. Some TON launchpads are using  Shahboz's way to implement token buy/sell action on pumpfun.

Ateeb: They are saying that their contract is a nominator pool, supporting an unspecified validator. It is quite complex but possible to calculate the reward by querying, in particular, The Elector; you'd need to know the chosen validator though.   Can someone help me on this ?

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: is that not what TON ecosystem does.  confirmation is only once unlike other networks like ethereum and others

&rey: A subscription plugin: docs contain information on it. (AFAIK it is not installable via any user-centred wallet. Reasons of that people tend to forget, or might not bother to check plugins which later take everything. Your frontend must establish a separate wallet and handle it.)  Please also don't reuse term "transaction" for this, because there is a clearer and more appropriate "payment plan". (reply to 159714)

..: I have already withdrawn from it before though.. ive had around 5ton out before into a diffrent wallet so I know it does payout. I don‚Äôt have the 20 ton or I would. It means risking more ¬£¬£¬£ üòÇ

Teemu | Ê©üÂô®‰∫∫ü™Ω: Yea the point is to give a little out, so they get more in. Those were very popular a while back, eventually they raise the APY so much that the ponzis die very fast (reply to 160318)

..: Horrible people. To much time on there hands Does anybody have any advice on where the best place is to buy ton and the best wallet to store it?

&rey: Such things are scam. Please don't grow attached to the values app shows, and be vigilant (i.e. check that any received assets are genuine instead of similarly-named jettons). Disengaging is recommended. (reply to 160302)

&rey: The https://ton.org/ has pages on wallet applications and purchasing TON. Look for custodial/non-custodial markers according to your needs.  And that is, by the way, off topic for this chat. (reply to 160320)

Code: Does anybody know why this transaction's Jetton Notify failed "out of gas" - even though there was Excess TON in the transaction?  https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/8a39aa3d7e201a55a45fb0060617fea3d6bdfe60541639fe59fef59aa0a3689d

&: Do you think this ton amount is enough?

Code: TON wallet does same, is it because it has a message?

&: If it's goes error. then is sth wrong? The jetton disappered? or sth else? (reply to 160335)

Code: the jetton transfer is successful, but the notification fails

&: Do you think that means "transfer failed"? No totally no. It's just "gas is not enough". not a "jetton transfer failed". (reply to 160337)

Code: ? there are 2 parts to the trace  1 is jetton transfer - which is fine 2. is the notification - which has out of gas error, which I'm trying to solve

&: Have you ever developed contract on TON? (reply to 160339)

Code: no

&: I think so. Gas optimization is necessary for ton development. Check official doc of ton.org (reply to 160341)

Code: I am following this guide https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/cookbook#how-to-construct-a-message-for-a-jetton-transfer-with-a-comment

Code: is it really necessary to send 0.02 TON? that's 6 cents - it doubles the cost of the transaction for the notification

&: Bro. check document. study gas optimization. It's necessary for ton development. you don't have basic understanding on it. (reply to 160344)

Code: that's what I'm asking - you're not being helpful lol

Code: this one worked (reply to 160334)

–í–∏–∫–æ–Ω—Ç vangaard: Short answer is you've been scammed. The long withdrawal time and paying to reduce withdrawal time is a classic scam technique. (reply to 160302)

&rey: Any message equal or over 0.00001 TON launches TVM to handle the incoming message. Sometimes wallet's checks are more expensive than that. (reply to 160347)

Code: I see  1. Do you think notification messages are even necessary? Tonkeeper does 1 nanoton for them, and the indexing seems to work fine 2. How can I ensure in my code that my messages have enough gas for the notification? And will the remainder be refunded? (reply to 160351)

&rey: 1. I'm of opinion that no notification is needed and that's job of wallet application to check. (reply to 160352)

Code: thanks &rey 2ne:v

Aldric: Hi guyz, I have a question. Can I modify the swap fee in Stonfi? For example, I want to take 10% of the swap from the user. Is that possible now?

Teemu | Ê©üÂô®‰∫∫ü™Ω: At least tokens launched from stonkspump have a fee mechanism (reply to 160366)

kevin: you can do that with two internal tx , say one for stonfi swap, one is to transfer certain amount of ton to you predefined wallet (reply to 160366)

Aldric: the token contract doesn't verify (reply to 160378)

Aldric: But it‚Äôs work for fee. Thank you sir (reply to 160378)

Ilya: The notify message is important because it allows anyone who is monitoring only the inbound messages to your wallet contract to detect that an event occurred on the jetton wallet. Without a notify, if some new arbitrary token is credited to the wallet, it would be impossible to track that balance change using just a lightserver. For this reason, the notify is highly recommended. (reply to 160352)

Ilya: However, the transaction that carries the notify does not need to succeed. Even a failed transaction still provides the required signal, and no changes on the wallet are expected after it. That‚Äôs why the approach of sending a notify with just 1 nanoton, which inevitably fails, is considered a normal and acceptable practice. (reply to 160401)

Code: Thank you so much Ilya for the info!

Ilya: That said, most wallets do not rely purely on light servers but on indexed blockchain. So if you skip the notify, it won‚Äôt be critical, although it‚Äôs still undesirable (reply to 160402)

Princewill Tor-Anyiin: You're not really purposeful about your goal.  You wanted to learn Solidity, but you changed your mind because Durov's vision?   TON Blockchain achieves massive scalability, high transaction speeds, and low fees through its multi-blockchain architecture with dynamic sharding and a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism.  The above qualities is why you should learn FunC and Tact languages -Not because of some else's vision that you don't fully grasp.  Good luck tho. (reply to 160674)

MoFR: Thanks, bro, for the info

&rey: And may truth be your guide. If someone's statements happen not to match reality, follow reality, for you cannot build a project otherwise.  TON can be well-suited to some applications and uniquely bad-suited to others like, say, flash loans.

Princewill Tor-Anyiin: Flash loans originate from EVM, there's no way it will work well in an asynchronous environment as TON.  The easiest and cheapest Blockchain Network for especially us from Africa is TON. It is cheaper and faster.  I don't refer to myself as a Developer -but I know this.

Mohammed: üí° Feature Proposal: Guardian Vault for TON Wallet  A smart wallet feature called Guardian Vault allows users to recover accounts via a distributed network of guardians, with:  ‚Ä¢ Timed approval & gradual fund release to prevent hijacking.  ‚Ä¢ Social recovery without seed phrases, beginner-friendly UX.  ‚Ä¢ Multi-sig smart contract & off-chain notifier for security.  Benefit: increases trust, reduces loss risk, and makes TON Wallet more secure and user-friendly.

Mohammed: 1 ‚Äî Instant Wallet with ‚ÄúSeedless Activation‚Äù (Onboard‚ÄëSafe)  Idea: Fast account creation using a username + short password with optional social recovery, instead of a seed phrase that intimidates beginners. Benefit: Reduces fear for regular users and increases wallet adoption. How it works (brief): Account generated on-device, optional TON DNS linking, guardians (3 friends or trusted accounts) can approve account recovery. Tech: Account abstraction + smart-contract wallet on TON, simplified UX, local encryption. Risks: Must be designed securely to prevent social recovery exploits. Funding: UX grants + security bug bounties.  ‚∏ª  2 ‚Äî Local Fiat On/Off Without Complexity  Idea: Partnerships with local payment gateways and prepaid cards to convert local currency ‚Üî Toncoin directly in the wallet. Benefit: Easier daily usage ‚Äî users can send/receive Toncoin seamlessly. How: Simple in-app KYC, instant TON network transfers, POS options for merchants. Tech: API integration with payment providers, currency conversion services. Funding: Commercial partnerships + small transaction fees.  ‚∏ª  3 ‚Äî Smart Wallet for Organizations & Community Insurance (Multi‚Äësig)  Idea: Multi-sig wallets for organizations + donation/compensation funds for scam victims. Benefit: Builds community trust, reduces user losses, attracts projects. How: Multi-sig smart contracts + UI to manage approvals, claim process after review. Funding: Donation campaigns + grants from security organizations.  ‚∏ª  4 ‚Äî Hidden Gas Transactions (Gas Abstraction)  Idea: UX hides gas complexity ‚Äî either a vendor or relay service pays the gas, or wallet automatically handles minor fees. Benefit: User experience similar to a regular bank card. How: Meta-transactions, relayer service manages gas payments on behalf of users. Tech: Relayer nodes + pricing policies. Risks: Security precautions to prevent misuse.  ‚∏ª  5 ‚Äî Mini‚ÄëApps Marketplace Inside the Wallet  Idea: A space inside the wallet for small apps (donations, tickets, games, ledgers) powered by TON. Benefit: Engages daily users and increases wallet usage. How: SDKs + app rating & incentive system for developers. Funding: Hackathons + developer incentives.  ‚∏ª  6 ‚Äî Smart Protection & Real-Time Alerts  Idea: Intelligent alert system for unusual spending or login attempts from new devices, with an immediate wallet freeze button. Benefit: Effective security for regular users. How: Heuristics + device fingerprinting + revoke button via smart contract. Funding: Bug bounty + cybersecurity partner.  ‚∏ª  7 ‚Äî Ephemeral Wallets for One-Time Payments  Idea: Create a temporary wallet for single transactions (e.g., paying a bill/subscription) that disappears afterward or converts into a claimable link. Benefit: Reduces risk when dealing with untrusted vendors. How: Time-limited smart account or delegated keys. Use case: Buying on open markets without sharing permanent keys.  ‚∏ª  8 ‚Äî TON Domains + Verified Identity in Wallet  Idea: Integrate TON DNS with optional verified KYC badges for easier sending & receiving. Benefit: Send funds using a name instead of a long address, builds commercial trust. How: Display verified badges, link with merchant/company KYC protocols.  ‚∏ª  ‚∏ª  Innovative Invention ‚Äî ‚ÄúGuardian Vault‚Äù: Smart Recovery Linked to Real Relationships  Overview: A smart TON wallet called Guardian Vault enables users to recover their accounts via a distributed network of guardians, with added safety mechanisms: timed voting, lightweight identity proofs (photo + OTP), and a temporary security vault that gradually releases funds to prevent social hijacking.  Why it‚Äôs different:  1. No one can instantly recover the account, even if 2 of 3 guardians approve ‚Äî a short time delay (e.g., 24h) allows cancellation via a secondary device.  2. Funds release gradually (e.g., 50% after 24h, 50% after 7 days) to minimize risk.  3. Beginner-friendly interface without technical jargon ‚Äî users select 3 guardians from contacts or trusted TON accounts.  Technical components:  ‚Ä¢ Smart-contract wallet with time-lock and multi-sig.

Micky: Hey devs üëã I‚Äôm working on a TON-based project called TON MicroPay a lightweight SDK for micro-transactions and in-app payments on the TON blockchain.  We‚Äôre currently testing on TON testnet and need a bit of test TON to deploy and benchmark our smart contracts. If anyone can share a few test coins, it‚Äôll help us move the preview phase forward.

kidogb: Hi, I'm trying to use ton/ton and ton/crypto to generate wallet from 12 words seedphrase. But the wallet address generated is difference with the ton keeper. I tried to import new wallet from the same seed phrase and use v5 wallet.  This is only happened with 12 words, 24 words still working normal

kidogb: Does anyone facing this issue before?

Tim: You probably need bip39 derivation to get address from 12 words (reply to 161657)

Princewill Tor-Anyiin: Hi, I need clarification.  I'm committed to building AFRO-NODE DApp as an entirely decentralized and stand-alone DApp and not integrated in any Web2 architecture like Telegram.  A full Web3 experience.  But as I'm getting fully into TON structure. I realized that it's core vision is to integrate fully with Telegram.  Can I achieve a full stand-alone DApp on TON Blockchain outside Telegram.  If yes, then please all my guidance should be in that direction. Because most of my registration keeps emphasizing on Telegram miniApp (TMA)

Slava: There is a difference between "integration" and "dependency". You can integrate your dApp with Telegram without depending on it. And this is probably a good idea. (reply to 161830)

&rey: The thing you are doing wrong is treating TON as something like other chains. It is really another spin on blockchain technology. (reply to 161878)

&rey: Those two calls can be different because of embedded deadline value, which is determined from current time. (reply to 161878)

&rey: Misnamed a bit, hash of external message is nothing but hash of external message. Not of transaction (though the explorers will happily process it as well). (reply to 161878)

Rouzbeh: Thanks for your helping, my code just works fine now i see amount deduction from my wallet  I see that the returned txId from my function is not as same as txId i see in my tonkeeper, so as you said that TON is different  1- how can i make sure transaction confirmed or rejected ? 2- how can i get true transaction id ? (reply to 161881)

&rey: Recall that TON transaction only involves one contract.  1,2. https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/transactions/hash-based-tracking (reply to 161882)

&rey: Some documentation is that old, indeed. (reply to 161876)

üê±: If you tx involves multiple messages and you are expecting the behavior of full confirmation, you might need to get verbose and check some more boc, not just the your in message. TON messages are asynchronous. (reply to 161882)

Ton21: Hi everyone üëã I‚Äôm currently working on a Jetton project called Ton21, and I‚Äôm integrating automatic balance tracking and transaction confirmation. Could someone share the best practice for verifying TON transaction status via Toncenter API or lite client?

Rouzbeh: in @ton/ton project there is a method called getTransactions how can i get hash of the transaction there is  - hash() function that reaturns a hash - stateUpdate.oldHash - stateUpdate.newHash  none of above hashes are equal to the one i see in tonKeeper   how can i get the transaction hash of my simple jetton transfer that ? (reply to 161898)

&rey: Which transaction, specifically, out of 3-5 composing a jetton transfer? (reply to 161924)

Rouzbeh: Ok let me explain i wrote a code for transfering jetton (USDT) from my wallet to another wallet      public async transferJetton(         asset: string,         amount: number,         destination: string     ) {         if (!Jetton[asset]) {             throw new Error(`Unsupported asset: ${asset}`);         }          const jettonMasterAddress = Jetton[asset].address;         const decimals = Jetton[asset].decimals;         const jettonAmount = BigInt(Math.floor(amount * 10 ** decimals));          const senderAddress = this.wallet.address.toString();         const jettonWalletAddress = await this.getUserJettonWalletAddress(senderAddress, jettonMasterAddress);          const messageBody = beginCell()             .storeUint(0x0f8a7ea5, 32)             .storeUint(0, 64)             .storeCoins(jettonAmount)             .storeAddress(Address.parse(destination))             .storeAddress(this.wallet.address)             .storeBit(0)             .storeCoins(0)              .storeBit(0)             .endCell();          const internalMessage = internal({             to: Address.parse(jettonWalletAddress.toString()),             value: toNano(TON_FEE_AMOUNT),             bounce: true,             body: messageBody,         });          const seqno = await this.contract.getSeqno();          await this.contract.sendTransfer({             seqno,             secretKey: this.keypair.secretKey,             messages: [internalMessage],         });     }  now i have one question - How can i track this transfer and see if its failed or confirmed ? - i tried multiple methods to create hash from my transfer method but none of them was equal to anything and i cant find that in tonviewer too (404) - i tried to use getTransactions method to get list of my wallet transactions but there are 3 or 4 hashes in that and none of was equal to the one i see in tonkeeper history  How can i have the transaction id of my transfer so i can see if its confirmed or not ? (reply to 161925)

Rouzbeh: im looking for any method, any function any way to give me the transaction id of my transfer so i can just track it :( (confirmed or failed) (reply to 161926)

Tim: Look into normalised external tep (reply to 161926)

&rey: plus also need to wait for actual transaction on jetton wallet, at least sender's (reply to 161934)

Rouzbeh: Hey guys i wan to do transfer jetton In a another wallet its ok but in the second one i get this error  LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot apply external message to current state : Failed to unpack account state  the only difference is that the second one is fresh wallet

&rey: So do you have TON in the second wallet?  TON is the native network token, someone must supply it for transactions to take place. (reply to 161978)

Rouzbeh: no no i dont have TON in it so the error is for not having enough balance right ? (reply to 161979)

&rey: Yes. To be more precise: there is no balance, so the TON shard's map of addresses to account states does not even have that address set, therefore there is no "account state" to unpack, thus the error. (reply to 161981)

Rouzbeh: Thanks, this was really helpful (reply to 161982)

&rey: The validators pretty much are the system and it is ultimately their decisions which determine how it shall work (and always been this way). They appear to work with TON Core team though, in regards to upgrades at least. (reply to 161995)

◊©◊®◊ï◊ê◊ú: Thank u, do we know the identity of the validators?

&rey: You can resolve ADNL addresses from https://tonviewer.com/config#34 with toncli to obtain their IP addresses. There is absolutely no requirement to identify further for a validator.  As a reminder, TON does not make any guarantees about fitness to your particular use case and so on. The distrust always remains a valid option (but then, why here?) (reply to 161999)

Alex: üöÄ First beta release of the new TON documentation is now live! üó∫ Jump ahead to beta-docs.ton.org or stay here to learn about the project's backstory, current achievements, and future plans.  For quite some time, developers shared the same feedback: TON documentation is too scattered, difficult to navigate, and has obvious gaps and inconsistencies.  We at TON Studio took that seriously and initiated the TON Docs Revamp project in late July. It is focused on the following four goals:  ‚Ä¢ To introduce a streamlined, discoverable structure that would be easy to navigate and search ‚Ä¢ To make documentation welcoming to all developers, from newcomers to seasoned professionals ‚Ä¢ To introduce and maintain stricter quality checks from humans and AIs to ensure proof-read, up-to-date, consistent, and clear content ‚Ä¢ And, finally, to set up documentation release pipelines for major TON builders, while making community contributions straightforward and approachable  üèÜ Today, with the help and suggestions from various developer teams, including Zengo, RSquad, TonTech, TON API team, and TON Core, the TON Studio is proud to present the first public version of this documentation. It already fulfills the first goal of comprehensive structure and rapidly moves towards achieving the third goal of content.  ü¶Ñ That said, this is a beta release: many pages await their contents, some pages require secondary reviews, while infrastructure, pipelines, and processes are only nourishing, not mature yet. All constructive feedback is appreciated.  So, what's in store already? We've got:  ‚Ä¢ Flat, easy-to-navigate structure ‚Ä¢ Hands-on articles with real examples whenever we can provide them ‚Ä¢ Visuals and diagrams, including various Mermaid diagrams ‚Ä¢ Smart AI search and summaries ‚Ä¢ Automatic CI spell checks and AI reviews based on the growing style guide ‚Ä¢ ...and much, much more!  üè† TON Docs Revamp features an engaging landing page that guides users through their TON journey, whether they're first exploring TON, building smart contracts, integrating wallets, or just want to access and navigate the documentation quickly.  üìù Re-written or brand new content includes pages for: mytonctrl, mylocalton, development setups with Sandbox and Blueprint (with major help from TonTech), IDEs and SDKs, gas estimation, analytics, oracles, bridges, TMAs, TON Connect, standard wallet contracts, Jettons, NFTs, TVM instructions (with proper search and discovery), TL-B, FunC and other TON-specific programming languages, web versions of whitepapers (with cross-links and solid AI summaries), and even a "Coming from Ethereum" guide!  üìà And this is just the beginning. Plans ahead and for the next month include:  - Release pipelines and assignments of relevant technical owners - Docs, infrastructure, and processes for approachable community contributions - More playgrounds, interactive components, and interactivity - Much more content - Stronger AI-based assistance as documentation grows  üéØ The main goals of this beta release are to show preliminary progress, willingness to make things right, and to collect feedback from the developer community before the full release, which is tentatively scheduled for November 17th.  We are nothing without the feedback from the community. If something is missing or confusing, let us know by filing a GitHub issue. Furthermore, help review new content whenever you or someone you know is deeply familiar with the topic. TON is vast, and there is always something to know or be aware of.  Prominent ecosystem projects are invited to host, co-own, and maintain their documentation with us. Keeping things in one place will enrich the user experience and AI responses.   üí™ Let's make the best documentation for TON. Together.  ‚Üí Beta release URL: beta-docs.ton.org ‚Üí GitHub repository: github.com/ton-org/docs ‚Üí Future milestones: github.com/ton-org/docs/milestone/3 (forwarded from TON Dev News)
