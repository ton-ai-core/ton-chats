+888: As demonstrated by the lastest Ton hack chalenge. It‚Äôs not only possible to have but to trigger parallel execution of a same smart contract using wallet v2/v3. And in a way that each line of code is executed at the same time (for example having line #313 being processed at the same time in 2 message) (reply to 148684)

&rey: That was not the case. (reply to 148685)

+888: Why can‚Äôt I post a link to the challange‚ÄØ? Or post any hyperlink in general‚ÄØ? (reply to 148686)

+888: As a way to implement mutexes. Please see questions/79625124/how-to-safely-decrease-a-variable-on-a-system-without-any-concurrency-control on StackOverflow. (reply to 148681)

&rey: OP of that thread is saying literally false things. (reply to 148690)

&rey: The chain acts as-if in each shard there is at most one transaction executed simultaneously.

&rey: Circled are the transactions (atomic units).

+888: So what about this webpage coming from the Ton validator‚Äôs developpers themselves‚ÄØ? (reply to 148691)

&rey: Well does it say anything about *single* transaction? (reply to 148696)

+888: Yes send two close requests for withdrawal: the easiest way is to send two messages in one transaction via wallet-v2/v3 (it supports sending up to 4 messages in one tx, however some manual scripting is required) (reply to 148698)

&rey: It must be disappointing but the whole tree had 63 transactions, not one. (reply to 148699)

&rey: It was a mess of terminology, which is nowadays more accurately said "to send two messages with one order to wallet-v3/v4".

&rey: This is a part of actual tree. And those circles were indeed executed in order, from top to down.

+888: What matters to me is the statement from the official developpers who design validator nodes that‚Äôs it‚Äôs possible to have the same line of code being run at the same time. I do care little in how it‚Äôs done (just that it‚Äôs possible to trigger it). (reply to 148700)

&rey: It is not possible to have the same line of code run multithreaded. Actually. Name two transactions (hashes, or lt+address) which interfered with storage or each other's variables.  You're welcome to hash of "better bank"'s final tree: 2c415141ea7042907dc44e0aefe806483bbf05a833657f8371582cf7970aa831. (reply to 148703)

+888: Of course since according to them it was exploited differently without using race condition. There‚Äôs no examples as a result on the blockchain. But I do notice the challenge was within a single smart contract /ton-blockchain/hack-challenge-1/tree/master/7.%20better_bank (reply to 148704)

&rey: A single smart contract ‚Äî yes. A single transaction ‚Äî no. Storage or variables interference ‚Äî no.  It's just that a bunch of transactions left contract in "unintended" state. (reply to 148705)

+888: How are race conditions within a smart contract address supposed to happen without storage interference‚ÄØ? (reply to 148706)

&rey: Running this code in parallel threads in C++ is also race condition: {    lock.acquire(); *p = 1; lock.release();    } {    lock.acquire(); *p = 2; lock.release();    } since you cannot determine if p will point to 1 or 2. (reply to 148708)

+888: But this code doesn‚Äôt check balances and send funds. To me only failure to not check balances concurently allows to withdraw money as a race condition (at least within the same smart contract address) (reply to 148709)

&rey: What in fact happened, simplified:  Contract had (balance=5000.10, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5010.04, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000), msg1(to=oneself, value=4999.96), msg2(to=A, value=10). msg1 arrived. (balance=4999.95, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5009.89, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000), msg1 failed silently due to flags, msg2(to=A, value=5009.83). (reply to 148708)

&rey: @mojulie56 it is in fact important to explain correctly. If a person cannot tell data race from race condition, their claims need to be disproved.

+888: Do you mean for the hashmap. BEcause the race condition never hapenned/exploited‚ÄØ? And the writeup indeed talks about 2 withdrawals (so without a deposit between) (reply to 148712)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: there is supposed to be one after the other computing right?  check, subtract balance before transfer. the next check again right? just like we have in ethereum (reply to 148710)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: I see (reply to 148713)

&rey: Do you know if your solution is correct? If it is, why? If it is not, why? How would you tell?  That's why you were muted the first time by the way. (reply to 148715)

+888: The ·¥èÍú± will ensure p will be updated not concurrently (serialization happens at processor 0 at least on Linux). What happens after might be a problem (reply to 148715)

&rey: I took explanation of what happened from actual blockchain tree and "aftermath" section. Would you like an explanation for first option, expected by task authors? (reply to 148714)

+888: The race condition is explained before the Aftermath section. I‚Äôm interested in the race condition not the hashmap bug (which acutally how the contract was exploited instead of triggering the race condition). (reply to 148719)

+888: The blockchain data is no indication about the race condition besides storing the vulnerable code. (reply to 148719)

&rey: Contract had (balance=5000, total_held=5000, A=0, B=5000). A deposited. (balance=5010, total_held=5010, A=10, B=5000). A half-withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=5005, A=5, B=5000), msg1(to=oneself, value=5000), msg2(to=A, value=5). msg1 did not arrive yet. A half-withdrew. (balance=0, no storage), msg3(to=A, value=5). msg1 arrived. (balance=5000, no storage). Contract deployed in initial state. (balance=5000, total_held=0). A deposited. (balance=5010, total_held=10, A=10). A withdrew. (balance=0, total_held=0, A=0), msg4(to=oneself, value=0), msg5(to=A, value=5010). (reply to 148720)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: this post should be explained. may be it clarify the scenario (reply to 148696)

+888: Which doesn‚Äôt match executing 2 message at the same time per the bug description (but match explorer data). A part of it should be¬†: * withdrawal send. * message arrive * other withdrawal sent * message arrive while the previous one is still running. (reply to 148723)

&rey: Your message doesn't match statement "So if withdraw request will reach bank while all money is on the fly, bank will be insolvent during request processing", while my expansion does. (reply to 148725)

+888: Yep with a time diagram /ton-blockchain/hack-challenge-1/issues/2 (on GitHub) (reply to 148724)

&rey: For the record, do you think my explanation is correct? (reply to 148728)

+888: Not exactly.  But you did give me doubt. I understand the withdrawal requests. But the bug description definitely implies executing withdrawal requests concurently. (reply to 148729)

+888: Which isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre talking about.

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Sorry for breaking in into your thread, but it seems you are talking about different race condition levels.  TON blockchain transaction is a ‚Äúconverting‚Äù by contract one incoming message into 0..N outgoing messages and modifications of contract storage data. It is atomic. Ton blockchains guarantees that two incoming messages for one contract will never be processed in parallel. No race condition is possible. That‚Äôs pcrafer says.   Problem with bank appears to exist because bank ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù transaction includes several blockchain transactions. So blockchain can‚Äôt guarantee atomicity of them all together. Contract design/logic should deal with it.

+888: No problem. But the race condition is described to happen within a single transaction‚Ä¶ (reply to 148732)

+888: The race condition is in how withdrawal request work. The other request are required but unrelated to the bug. (reply to 148732)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: if we all agree with your post, then the question of poster is effectively solved. if two different message is sent to a contract, it get processed one after the other and never parallel. (reply to 148732)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: this is what I normally expected.   why will two different message be even processed in parallel in the first place

Torit: How do I contact a technician?

Daniel: Wdym? (reply to 148742)

NPA120: What can I help you? (reply to 148742)

+888: One way I think of is requesting the contract execution from a different shard : message would be run on the next block. (reply to 148737)

+888: I don‚Äôt known what Wallet v2/V3 is. (reply to 148737)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: you should be satisfied by now that message get processed one after the other. okay?  v2, v3 or v4 v5 etc are ton wallet versions... (reply to 148752)

Torit: There is a domain that I want to buy to my address, but it is already bought, but it has expired, the owner of it for a very long time does not prodolevayut, but I still can not buy it, support @ton_help_bot said to write to a technician that he would help to buy this domain to my address (reply to 148747)

NPA120: can you let me know that domain? (reply to 148757)

Torit: Can I write in private messages? (reply to 148758)

NPA120: sure, NP

Michaelzy: Hello guys i want to know if its possible to create a proxy contract using tact that uses a seperate contract for logic execution

Lir√¢: GM from Turkey :)

&rey: It is quite complex. Why? TON has SETCODE for changing logic in-place. (reply to 148821)

Michaelzy: how does setcode work? can't find it in the docs  the reason i want to use proxy is because my logic may change in the future after an audit or changes in design (reply to 148826)

&rey: 1. Replaces contract's code cell with provided one; upon any subsequent transaction, new one will be used. 2. https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#set_code 3. Please don't expose users to unverified logic which you expect to change. (reply to 148828)

Michaelzy: it seems its not available in tact? (reply to 148829)

&rey: Well you should consider what happens to contract's data. (reply to 148830)

Michaelzy: true i'll make sure to audit first (reply to 148829)

Michaelzy: contract data doesn't change only logic will (reply to 148831)

&rey: Different compilations might expect data to be laid out in different order. (reply to 148833)

Michaelzy: okay but does this mean i cant change logic in tact directly? (reply to 148834)

Michaelzy: so i have to go ahead with proxy

&rey: Proxy doesn't seem to help in the slightest. How would it inherit data of previous contract? (reply to 148836)

Michaelzy: data and logic contracts would be seperate. when i make changes (upgrade) the logic contract, i would pass the address of the new logic contract into the data contract and then the data contract calls the methods of the new logic contract during execution (reply to 148837)

&rey: > the data contract calls the methods of the new logic contract during execution  You do remember that each cross-contract interaction is mediated by a message, changing transaction context too? (reply to 148838)

&rey: It is possible to create pseudo-proxy using dy libraries, but it would make for very unidiomatic Tact ‚Äî such that any audit would reject it.

Michaelzy: don't get what you mean by changing transaction context (reply to 148839)

Michaelzy: that shouldnt affect the logic execution

&rey: Well your data contract got a message, and that started a transaction. It sends outgoing message to logic contract, and then its transaction ends.  It might be important in some cases. (reply to 148842)

Michaelzy: for an nft collection proxy, i'd simply create a logic contract that handles minting of the new nft-items

Michaelzy: ok i understand  but as long as i'm passing the require fields from the incoming message to the outgoing message it should be good? (reply to 148844)

&rey: And then how would items know to trust your logic contract? Presumably they don't know its address in advance. (reply to 148845)

&rey: Also, you cannot delegate get-methods (since there is no ability to wait for a message), which means your contract system will not be an NFT collection. Bingo.

Michaelzy: in the nft-item contract, i would have an address-type variable that stores address of the logic contract. and have a message receiver to update the address of this variable then when fucntions in the item contract are called, i'd simply run a check to make sure sender is logic contract (reply to 148847)

Michaelzy: the get methods return data from the data contract so i wouldn't need to delegate such (reply to 148848)

&rey: And any update to logic contract address would run through how many, potentially hundreds of thousands of NFTs? (reply to 148850)

Michaelzy: for instance the variables in this get function are all stored in the data contract and don't depend on the logic contract get fun get_collection_data(): CollectionData {         return CollectionData{             next_item_index: self.next_item_index,             collection_content: self.collection_content,             owner_address: self.owner         };     } (reply to 148851)

Michaelzy: ok this seems like a good concern (reply to 148852)

Michaelzy: having to send messages to each nft item to upgrade the logic contract

Michaelzy: but consider the fact that upgrades won't happen as often and most times upgrades aren't ever done

&rey: And will NFT item address be independent of logic contract? If so, what logic is there to change? (reply to 148853)

Michaelzy: it's primarily just a safe measure in case there's a bug that wasn't detected earlier (reply to 148856)

Michaelzy: yes it will be independent (reply to 148857)

Michaelzy: good morning guys Tact dev here i currently have this transaction payload in my script that sends message to my contract and it executes successfully.  const message = beginCell()     .storeUint(2016634319, 32)     .storeUint(0, 64)     .storeStringRefTail(trackData.tun3zTitle)     .storeStringRefTail(trackData.coverImage)     .endCell();  this is the message in my contract message Mint{     query_id: Int as uint64;        name: String;     image: String; }  But i want to make the name and string values optional in my contract like this  message Mint{     query_id: Int as uint64;        name: String?;     image: String?; }  how can i modify my payload to match this new message struct because old one wont work

ISMA&COIN: Hello, we applied for grants, we would like to clarify whether it is possible to receive feedback?

Andy: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/func/#convert-serialization  > All optional types are serialized as Maybe in TL-B, except for Address.  https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-types#maybe  To read more about what TL-B is, check this page: https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-language It's a little overwhelming at first, but once you begin grasping TL-B - you'll significantly level up as a TON developer, no matter the language (Func, Tact, Tolk, maybe even Fift), since it just defines how things are serialized to cells.  Specifically for your example, it's as simple as adding .storeUint(1, 1) before every .storeStringRefTail and simply .storeUint(0, 1) when there isn't a string.  You could also change to something like storeMaybeStringRefTail that'd work like `storeMaybeRef` (reply to 148935)

&: Try toncenter. (reply to 148996)

Andy: What does message mode flag +32 actually do?  As far as I understand, destroying the account sets it to uninit state, so it can be redeployed and of course such a contract stops acquiring storage fee debt.  But why would a contract that'll never be used again destroy itself? Is it just a best practice? Does it reduce blockchain storage size or something else that makes it beneficial in the long run?  Are there any use cases for redeploying a destroyed contract (except the TON Hack "use case", that is more of a vulnerability really)? Does redeploying the same account use less storage or cause any similar beneficial metrics?  Do libraries of a destroyed contract get removed?

&rey: Well if a routine (withdrawal from a complicated staking perhaps?) is complete, the contract managing it has no reason to be up. (reply to 149013)

&rey: That way, contract existence indicates that routine is still running and should not be invoked again.

Leo: And if not destroyed explicitly, the contract will owe storage fees and get destroyed sometime in the future, after which it can also be redeployed. So it's not about security.

Slava: Gas fees are deducted from the contract's balance after it's execution, based on the amount of gas units actually used (but no more than the amount of the incoming message by default).  However, besides the gas fees there are other types of fees.  Actually, fee management is one of the most nastiest problems in TON. You should study the docs very careful and try everything for yourself. (reply to 149108)

&rey: Both, and part of that amount is forwarded to destination contract too.  Jetton wallet, in its kindness, refunds some TON to responseAddress. (reply to 149108)

Marous: If it is deducted from the contracts balance I can just put amount: 0 then ? (reply to 149110)

Slava: You are missing this part. (reply to 149110)

Slava: See this.

Marous: Got it. It won't work, I have to atleast specify the exact amount of gas fees in the amount section minimum or else the tx will revert (reply to 149114)

Slava: You should provide enough extra coins to cover all the fees for the execution of the entire transaction chain to be more precise.

&rey: "will revert" ‚Äì why do you think so? (reply to 149116)

Marous: because gas fees is deducted from amount and it is 0 so th tx wont work so it will revert (reply to 149118)

&rey: The last step is faulty. (reply to 149119)

&rey: That transaction will end abruptly with out-of-gas error, no actions will be applied, and handling stops at that.

&rey: No reverting changes of prior transactions of the tree.

&rey: If other tree branches had sent some messages, those will be handled as usual ‚Äì this tx has no influence on them.

Evgenii: Hello there! I am using @ton/ton library to call my contract's GET method. It used to work fine until couple of days ago. Since then I'm getting errors "failed to unpack account state".  bluepring client works just fine. tonClient4 also doesn't lead to any errors. It's only tonClient + apiKey.   All of the above is relevant for the testnet only.  Does anybody have any idea why?

Mehmet Ankara: Question to the TON Dev Community: Hi everyone üëã  I'm analyzing the wallet contract structure for Wallet V5, particularly the part where the wallet state is initialized using the following structure:  ts Kopyala D√ºzenle beginCell()   .storeBit(config.signatureAllowed)   .storeUint(config.seqno, 32)   .storeUint(config.walletId, 32)   .storeBuffer(config.publicKey, 32)   .storeDict(config.extensions, Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256), Dictionary.Values.BigInt(1))   .endCell(); I have a question regarding the config.walletId value.  üß† What exactly is walletId (also referred to as subwallet_id) supposed to represent in this context?  And more specifically:  üëâ What value does the official Telegram Wallet (W5) use for walletId when deploying user wallets?  Is it always the same hardcoded value for all users, or is it dynamically derived per user or key?  Any clarification or pointers to where this is defined (FunC or deployment logic) would be much appreciated üôè  Thanks in advance!

Slava: Having unpredictable walletId will make your wallet (seed phrase) incompatible with other wallet software. (reply to 149486)

Slava: What's that? (reply to 149486)

Mehmet Ankara: So how can I import a wallet with the same address as the memoric list? (reply to 149487)

Slava: You can call the get_subwallet_id on the deployed wallet contract to determine the ID used.

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: this is exactly my experience too. different wallet address.  somebody should provide answer to this.

Slava: When instantiating a wallet contract's wrapper you need to provide exactly the same init data (considering the same code is used) that was used for deploying the existing wallet's smart contract. Otherwise you will get a different address.

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: v5 for example gives different address in script (reply to 149681)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: and different address in tonkeeper even though I used same phrase

Slava: Seed phrase is only a part of the init data. You need to provide all the other details exactly the same as well.

Slava: By the way, why don't you use the createFromAddress method for instantiating the wallet? Considering the wallet is already deployed‚Ä¶

.kodgen: Your wallets were not accidentally created in 2019?

&rey: What was the class of issue? Did it involve any service beyond TON Blockchain? (reply to 149954)

Slava: I want to share some important information about using TON HTTP API keys. Below are the best practices discussed with my friends at toncenter.com:  1. RPS (Requests Per Second) Limits: Each toncenter account has a limit on the number of requests. Higher tariff plans allow for more requests, enabling more users to access the application simultaneously.  2. Limiting RPS by IP Address: There is an option to limit RPS based on IP addresses. If your Web3 application exposes the API key on the client side, we strongly recommend enabling this setting. Without it, your service is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DOS) attacks from a single IP address.  3. Domain Name Restrictions (CORS): Implementing restrictions based on domain names is advisable, particularly for Web3 apps. While this measure is not foolproof, it can help prevent unauthorized use of your API key in other web applications.  4. Utilizing a Reverse Proxy: Because the above protective measures can potentially be bypassed, it's recommended not to expose your API key directly. Instead, consider setting up a reverse proxy. This will hide the key and provide you with additional ways to defend against attacks if you have the necessary resources.  5. Full Backend Solution: The most reliable solution, though not ideal for Web3 applications, is to have a complete backend setup that includes caching, request limitation, and authentication.  6. Current Challenges for Web3 Applications: For a full-fledged Web3 applications, the situation is still quite challenging. By enabling domain binding and IP-based RPS restrictions, you can potentially maintain service under normal conditions. However, in the event of a DDoS attack, there is a high likelihood of service disruption, particularly for small projects on lower tariff plans with limited RPS. This remains true even with the presence of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common attacks.  At this point, the only reliable solution I see for decentralized finance (DeFi) is to allow users to input their own endpoints and API keys within your Web3 application. Although this may negatively impact the user experience, it promotes decentralization, which comes with its own costs.

AGT: Gentlemen, is there any way to destroy the tokens transferred to the black hole address?

Jimmy: Unfortunately, tokens that end up in a "black hole" address (i.e. an address that cannot be controlled or from which funds can be extracted) cannot be destroyed or returned. A black hole in the blockchain is simply an address that does not belong to anyone, and funds sent there are lost forever. (reply to 149980)

&rey: That's quite imprecise; the TON black hole -1:ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff also disposes of any native currency sent to it (IIRC half those TON are distributed by validators and half are destroyed reducing the total stat). (reply to 149982)

AGT: But the total circulation on the chain includes this part of the tokens, right? (reply to 149982)

&rey: That's the point; it does NOT. Just like half of transaction fees are destroyed, meaning that those TON are no more. You can see that the black hole address (whose alternative spelling is Uf___________________________________________-ll) contains zero TON despite being sent some. (reply to 149987)

Jimmy: No (reply to 149987)

AGT: UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ This is the address I transferred to. (reply to 149988)

&rey: No. The t–ækens are owned by this address, but no one will ever deploy a contract there, so no one will be able to do anything with t–ækens. (reply to 149992)

AGT: Is this address a black hole address? (reply to 149993)

Jimmy: Stop deleting my information to that dude pls. (reply to 149993)

&rey: No. It is just unusable (unless SHA-256 preimage is found for all-zeros, which is harder than mining). (reply to 149994)

AGT: My tokens were issued 190,000,000 before, I transferred 1010,000,000 here, but tonscan shows that there are still 190,000,000 tokens in circulation

AGT: It seems that I was wrong, this is an irreversible mistake (reply to 149996)

&rey: Please note that black hole does not do anything to non-native tokens either (and TEP-74 jettons are fungible tokens).  TEP-74 has a special facility, burn message, which allows to permanently remove some jettons you own.

AGT: üëåüèø

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Yes. The fact that you don‚Äôt know seed (private key) from some contract that owns your jettons doesn‚Äôt mean that these jettons do not exist. The fact that nobody knows (and has no chance to know) means the same. To ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù some jettons you need to send them back to jettons master with ‚Äúburn‚Äù command. Jetton master will decrease total amount (reply to 149997)

Alula: Hello TON Dev community ‚Äî I‚Äôm with Covalent, and we‚Äôre exploring partnership and indexing opportunities on TON. Could someone point me to the right person or team to speak with?

Soon Guan: Hi all! I'm interested in understanding staking rewards per ton account  Is it possible to do the following with transactions and messages data?   1. Fetch stake/unstake movement of TON from nominators and validators  2. Identify rewards accrued for each staker (nomin/validator) after each election   3. Identify rewards of all validators in each election cycle?   Basically I want to input address X and find how much staking rewards it has received for accounting purpose

Alula: That‚Äôs a real challenge ‚Äî I found some block explorers and APIs that sort of let you pull this info, but it‚Äôs patchy at best.  That‚Äôs actually why I think a TON x Covalent partnership could be powerful.  I can get 100+ EVM wallet balances instantly with Covalent ‚Äî why not TON? Structured access to staking data, validator rewards, and onchain movements would open up a ton of use cases for devs, auditors, and infra teams. (reply to 150308)

Andrei: I think I sorted it out Thanks though (reply to 150314)

&rey: You could start with the Elector contract / reading network parameter which holds current stakes. (reply to 150308)

Dalen: Hello everyone! I'm looking for a solution for on-chain randomness on the TON blockchain. I found the Tact documentation here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-random/#randomint Is it truly secure enough for use in a production environment? Are there any other solutions available?

&rey: First, you need a specification: who commits to invoking your contract and who commits to a random number at which moment, plus to set stakes level. That will allow to make an informed choice. (reply to 150781)

Dalen: In the case of the current application I'm building, anyone can call the contract at any time, and staking is not possible. Are there any other solutions available? I found this article on Medium ‚Äî is this method truly secure for use in a production environment? https://medium.com/miki-dev/true-randomness-on-ton-blockchain-60670f455027 (reply to 150782)

&rey: This should be solved at theoretical level, subject to these two constraints: 1. User shouldn't have ability to know the number before they commit to sending message to your contact. 2. Whoever provides the last bits of entropy (when using LT, that's a validator; ECVRF doesn't provide entropy itself, just generates an unpredictable number) shouldn't be able to calculate the result after user commits to send a message, but before they commit to that entropy.

Zaidu: My project is about Ziver, a pioneering Multi-chain project meant to revolutionize and give a new meaning to cryptocurrencies.  I don't know if I am allowed but here's our whitepaper:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/16f3_po7M2OxfAUM8gaz4mbMHe12GW1ii/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=100918683306786672033&rtpof=true&sd=true  ---------    You can get all the information about this project there, and you get our progress through our telegram channel:  https://t.me/zivcoins (reply to 150797)

Dalen: does we have any example? (reply to 150786)

Dalen: I plan to implement a commit-reveal scheme for my app. However, I couldn‚Äôt find any examples of it‚Äîonly examples of randomize_lt and block skipping.   https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/security/random-number-generation (reply to 150786)

&rey: Well all primitives (that is, probably, cell_hash) are in place. (reply to 150804)

Azim: Hi everyone,  We‚Äôre building a product on the TON network and need a VRF (Verifiable Random Function) service for one of its components. I‚Äôve explored several options, and recently found a VRF solution developed by a group called Hexolabs‚Äîbut the only resource I could locate is their GitHub repository:  @github/hexolabs-web3  If you have any knowledge of the team or the company behind this project, or if you‚Äôve used their VRF service yourself, I‚Äôd be grateful for your insights. I‚Äôm especially interested in whether the project is officially recognized, whether it has undergone any audits, and any other relevant details you can share.  Thanks in advance!

&rey: I could not find the actual verified randomness function inside it. (reply to 150818)

Azim: do you have access to their contracts' code ? marked ‚Äúconfidential implementation‚Äù in their docs (reply to 150819)

&rey: Apparently it is inside EQAlanxuEMsnWh0EhV2rwfelemQZpJM8uyvN0tM62IWPzQ0L but they didn't publish that code! Though you most certainly don't want to pay that much.

&rey: I had written ECVRF impl once, at https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ecvrf-coordinator-contract/blob/master/src/ecvrf.fc, but I missed an important part of it so it needs patching.

Azim: Oh, you‚Äôre ProgramCrafter, by the way?   I‚Äôve read your work and put a lot of effort into using it.

&rey: One and the same. (reply to 150824)

Azim: What you‚Äôve accomplished is really impressive, but as you‚Äôve mentioned, some key parts are still unfinished. Do you plan to complete them? I imagine many in the community urgently need a production-ready VRF implementation on the network. @pcrafter

&rey: The oracle somewhat worked but had only one use besides me, unfortunately. Though I can complete it. (reply to 150827)

&rey: By the way I cannot attest to their knowledge of idiomatic Rust either, because they chose to change environment variables instead of configuring the logging library inside code. (reply to 150818)

Azim: So I hope we can become one of its biggest, most frequent users once you complete it. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but could we have a more detailed conversation about it? (reply to 150828)

&rey: It is open source software. Will be done soon. (reply to 150830)

Azim: So you really are finishing it‚Äîthat‚Äôs great to hear! From our earlier chat I had the impression you might have abandoned the project. I hope I can start using it very soon. Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions so patiently.

Nerses: How do DEDUST or STON.fi handle storage fees on their contracts? Who actually pays these fees? Do they deposit funds into the contracts specifically to cover storage fees, or are the stuck/unclaimed swap funds used for this purpose? Or maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding how it works and there‚Äôs a better approach? Would appreciate any clarification!

Investor: I'm building NemexCoin ‚Äì a pioneering TON-based Task-to-Earn (T2E) and wallet project focused on enabling easy Web3 access for non-crypto users. We're integrating a unique anti-rug pull mechanism to foster trust and security. Our backend is already progressing, and we're actively seeking a talented Frontend Developer to join us in a collaborative capacity to integrate key wallet components for our Telegram Mini-App:  * Wallet interface (Create/import)  * Token display (balance + USD value)  * Send/receive UI (TON + jetton) Experience with TON Connect, Web3, and mobile-first design is preferred. This is an early-stage opportunity where compensation will be token-based, with vesting tied to mutually agreed-upon project milestones. This ensures early contributors gain a significant stake in NemexCoin's shared success. If you're passionate about building for mass adoption on TON and are open to a collaborative, token-based model, please contact me directly on Telegram: @InvestorSirri"

–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤: What exactly do you want to test? If that‚Äôs something like connecting wallet or sending a transaction, you can do it on main-net, if you get your wallet app opening with prompting you to make transaction you‚Äôre good, you don‚Äôt have to send a transaction to make sure that tonconnect works, but if you want to test tonconnect integration in whole flow that‚Äôs another question (reply to 150873)

–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤: Well in most cases you don‚Äôt need to use testnet with tonconnect unless you want to test actual transactions sending or calling some contract and don‚Äôt want to spend some funds paying fees (reply to 150875)

&rey: Choose testnet in the wallet app and do connection as usual. You will see -3 chain ID in tonConnectSDK.account, while -239 stands for mainnet. (reply to 150873)

&rey: Any console output, too? (reply to 150885)

&rey: Well it shouldn't be the reason because Tonkeeper uses another bridge. Have you tried connecting another wallet then? (reply to 150889)

Jason üÜô UXUY $ETN: Hi guys how's everyone had a quick question if anybody can point me in the right direction to documentation if there's a possibility of capturing all transactions of a specific Jetton Master, meaning transactions that happened of that Jetton between various Jetton wallets without specifying the Jetton wallets via any API obviously it's easy to capture swaps from a dex but I meant all transactions that that coin has so whenever it's sent between users

&rey: Tonviewer does this IIRC, and you can see its data sources in the bottom right corner. (reply to 150897)

Ricardo: So im trying to dynamically get the blochain configuration parameter number 21, using strictly the ton core libraries, has anyone done this in JS?

Justice: I have done similar (reply to 150912)

Andersen: Hoping to ask questions related to the validator operation here, from what I understand ~2M ton is the maximum effective stake per validator currently.. Does this mean if I had say 100M TON I would need to run 50 separate validators? Do people run multiple isolated validators on one hardware deployment? as 50 separate deployments is just too much cost.

Ricardo: Do you have code example? (reply to 150920)

Justice: Not at the moment (reply to 150926)

&rey: We must hope that you do not do that; such centralization could bring down a shard if 1/3 of its validators failed. (reply to 150924)

Ricardo: In its defect, i need a dynamic way to load all of the blockchain's configuration parameters using ton/ton library

Andersen: man 2m ton per validator deployment is so low.. especially given the high specifications to run one..The ton earnings must be really high. (reply to 150928)

&rey: The underlying API call is https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/get%20config/get_config_all_getConfigAll_get; I'm not sure if there is a ready wrapper function. (reply to 150929)

Roj: Why can‚Äôt I send videos here? :(

Andersen: Hi everyone,  I‚Äôm currently working on a TON profitability calculator and would really appreciate a peer review from the community. While I‚Äôve gone through a lot of the documentation, I‚Äôm still relatively new to the ecosystem, so any feedback or pull requests would be incredibly helpful.  My top priority is ensuring that the calculations are accurate and based on reliable data sources and protocol-level parameters.  You can find the project here: https://github.com/blueprint-infrastructure/TON  Thanks in advance!

Roj: Does anyone know why this is not working?

James: The issue I kept running into has to do with the "url" value in the tonconnect-manifest.json. I coud never get it to resolve by setting the value to my local machine. Not much help, but I would start looking there. (reply to 150997)

Roj: It‚Äôs unfortunately already a publicly accessible URL. (reply to 150998)

Roj: No, that didn‚Äôt work either.

James: I was able to get it to work using Vercel. Uploaded the project, then changed that value to the URL for the vercel app. (reply to 151001)

‚∏∏ | ·¥ç·¥è Ä·¥á…¥: I'm working on launching a token through a token generator platform, and I‚Äôm looking to build a reward distribution system that activates only after a small on-chain transaction is made.  Specifically, I'm looking to:  1. Enable users to receive tokens after sending a predefined transaction (acting like an access gate).   2. Configure the transaction amount and direct it to a custom destination address.   3. Decide whether to implement this entirely on-chain (via contract logic), or partially through frontend interaction.    I‚Äôd really appreciate code samples, advice, or shared experience from anyone who's done something similar.  Thanks a lot!

Andersen: Thanks for checking, Immediate goal is to confirm the accuracy and approach, as I feel the profitability is a bit optimistic, but at the same time I think I followed all the documentation. - Hoping to get some experienced eyes on it to expose anything I did wrong.  Next step on the roadmap is to research the leading validators and compare their earnings on chain to the estimations, then deploy some validators and monitor the results comparing them with the calculator, but id like to have more confidence before capital deployment.

Andersen: Thanks for taking a look, my hope is that its accurate (reply to 151029)

.: Hi ! Can anyone help me?)  Can smart contract use method of other smart contract ?  For example:  I want to use method "get_wallet_address" / "get_jetton_data" of jetton_minter in my smart contract on FunC  Is it really ?

&rey: Retrieving them from another contract is not possible due to strong tx isolation (transaction only touches one contract). (reply to 151052)

&rey: If you have master's code+data+address as cells, on the other hand, you can do RUNVM.

&rey: e.g. https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/tvm-quirks/blob/master/ok-jetton-wallet-onchain.fc

.: Oh, I saw this code, and it‚Äôs only available method to get Jetton Wallet Address ?  I want to get Jetton Wallet Address, but this system is so hard for me)) (reply to 151055)

&rey: are you familiar with concept of code modularity? (reply to 151057)

&rey: It abstracts complexity out, leaving you to call calc_my_jetton_wallet(master_addr, master_code, master_data).

&: Smart contract cannot run getty functions of other contract. (reply to 151052)

.: I know, I saw https://gist.github.com/ProgramCrafter/53fc3a4846397ee5f3f3b25ca3356ab5 but need I to get master_code and master_data, yes?  And in which format I need to use master_code and master_data? (reply to 151059)

&rey: yes, from Tonviewer or like. (reply to 151063)

&rey: cells, just like when you put them in StateInit. It is simpler if you handle them with TS and put into contract's data. (reply to 151063)

Nerses: what is the best approach to get number of Cells and bits of contract ? also is it possible to do on chain ?

&rey: This: https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#compute_data_size. It is easier to do onchain than offchain, but more expensive. (Offchain calculation obviously costs zero.) (reply to 151068)

Nerses: In case this info will be used for storage fee calculation isnt it optimal to do that on chain, as it will be calculated just once, or that data is dynamically changing in case of storing more and more data ? (reply to 151069)

&rey: Well IF (and only if) you store more and more data, then more data will be stored. Blockchain does not force contracts to pay for transaction history; in exchange, it does not guarantee that transaction history is preserved. (reply to 151070)

Nerses: I meant in storage fee calculation is used the size of code (the logic) or the whole data that currently in contract is stored ? (reply to 151071)

&rey: Whole data. Including balance and other metadata, that is. (reply to 151072)

Nerses: thanks for clarification. So what you think of using hardcoded storage fees like in some Jetton implementations.Are there any known issues on it ? (reply to 151073)

Artem: Hi all! Does ton have a standardized way of introducing new changes to the chain like Ethereum does with EIPs? I've seen the TEPs repo, but it seems kind of incomplete with only some proposals being written. Also, it doesn't seem like the original infra left by the Telegram team long ago is documented properly either, for example I couldn't find specs for the Elector contract in any whitepaper PDFs or the proposals. How does the community and the TON Foundation manage to work on the project without an actualized spec of the network? üòÖ

&rey: I have heard TON Studio has internal documentation and test harness. Something may also be in audit reports for those fundamental smart contracts. (reply to 151108)

Artem: True, Certik's report and article do have some info about the elector contract, but I mentioned it just as an example. Would I be right to assume then that the chain development is mostly discussed within the TON Foundation itself, as well as github issues and tonresear.ch? Meaning there isn't a properly formalized mechanism being used for publishing upgrade specs etc (reply to 151109)

BizX: Hey, are you looking for dev? (reply to 149045)

Ricardo: Hey guys, im getting:  Error: grams overflow  when calling emulateMessageToWallet using '@ton-api/client' dependency, what does that mean?

Ricardo: problem solved, thank you (reply to 151116)

Ricardo: On another note, How likely is it that TON blockchain will change its configuration parameter number 21? what would it take to make such a change?

Ricardo: I have been trying to dynamically fetch the configuration parameter number 21 that dictates computation costs, i know i can do it with @ton-api/client, but i cant use that client, i can only use TonClient from @ton/ton npm package. Also how is this parameter stored in the blockchain? is it like a contract address?

&rey: Probably yet another order of magnitude of adopters, or TON going much up. So it is likely to happen at some moment but not in near future. (reply to 151119)

&rey: in The Config fundamental smart contract. (reply to 151120)

Ro: Is it possible to retrieve current API request usage statistics for tokens from TONCenter and TONConsole.com? Are there any unofficial APIs or alternative methods available for this? I'm looking for programmatic access to this usage data.

Waterso: Hi, do anyone know about how protocols like STON.fi, DeDust.io, or other service handle transaction syncing.  - Use public APIs like getTransactions from toncenter or TONAPI? - Run their own indexer synced from public liteservers? - Run their own liteserver?  What‚Äôs generally recommended for syncing transactions in production environments.

&rey: You mean the DEX part? It is inside the chain itself, binding validators to run the protocols. (reply to 151177)

Waterso: I mean the off-chain infrastructure used by them.  To improve user experience, I assume they don‚Äôt rely only on calling get method. For example, they provide APIs (some even GraphQL) and offer stats and analytics features.  I‚Äôm curious how they sync all this data from the chain in production environments. (reply to 151179)

Artem: The config and elector contracts are mentioned in the TON bug bounty but it'd be pretty hard to work on them considering that there are two different versions of each. From what I gathered the new versions were written based on the comments from the Phase 1 audit, which doesn't seem to be published anywhere. Trying to report anything related to these contracts would probably be closed as N/A since it has already been reported in Certik's audit :P  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/bug-bounty

&rey: 1. Obviously yes. I'd even say that you cannot create any liquidity pools nor add anything before creation (if you're not using something something presale which handles all of that automatically). (reply to 151761)

&rey: 2. To my knowledge, creating liquidity pool is trustless, can just be done on ston.fi / dedust.io. Does that fail for you?

Teers k üêæ: I guess it's not telegram ads team chat and there is low chance there is any of tg ad agent is there (reply to 152054)

Teers k üêæ: Make sure that you writed api key perfectly and request is going fully. Or just do request manually without programming like curl (reply to 152058)

ARCH | Basti: I'm just using blueprint instructions:  npx blueprint run --custom <rpc_endpoint> --custom-version v2 --custom-type testnet --custom-key <API_KEY>

ARCH | Basti: the api key I generated is for testnet..

ARCH | Basti: I also pasted the api key in the existing openapi docs for json rpc v2 and got the same error

pictro: I'm looking for a partner to work with. (ü•áPlease don't have any Ukraine connections, and please connect me with a lot of people who know a bit about code.) What I'm offering is a partnership where I handle all my work and client communication through an Upwork account that I open in your name. You don't have to manage or hire anyone. Just provide me with a verified account and I'll handle the rest.  In return, you get a percentage of the revenue without having to directly participate in the project itself. It's kind of like passive income.  I totally understand if you don't want to do this, but I wanted to make this clear in case things change. Please DM me in any way you can. Thanks so much for your time!  Thank you.

So let's say I give you an account to work under... if my tax rate is 45% with state and federal income taxes, and then I'm also going to be liable if you scam people or don't finish jobs, how much of the revenue percentage are you going to give me?

Lase: Sorry, ton wallet account (reply to 152178)

&rey: Then, you should check version + settings. Also, if there were funds on v4, TK detects that and uses it first. (reply to 152180)

Lase: Everything works for v5 perfectly (reply to 152181)

Lase: But they said beginners should start from v5, which is what i am doing

Lase: I used different mnemonic . But would get a different address for w5 compared wot whats on tonkeeper

Carlos: Hi, why am i getting this on toncenter api, my api really exists  {   "ok": false,   "error": "API key does not exist",   "code": 401 }

Carlos: if api_key param is removed, it would return 429 (rate limit) instead of 401. Toncenter by default allows request if not limited, if rate limit is present then it checks for api key param/header (which is the case) so it keeps returning 401 for me (reply to 152191)

Joseph: Help me understand the difference between Ton space wallet V4R2 and V5?

&rey: v3r2: base wallet which can send up to 4 messages in a single transfer order v5: advanced wallet with up to 255 messages an order, support from providing gas outside ("gasless transactions"), support for plugins  v4r2: as of now, kinda base wallet, similar to v3r2 but more expensive in fees (though supports plugins too) (reply to 152202)

Always Polite: Its different contract address not official (reply to 152310)

&rey: To obtain an expired TON DNS domain (actually, start a week-long auction on it), you must:  Obtain NFT address ‚Äî e.g. by entering <domain>.ton.resolve-contract.ton in an explorer. Obtain required amount in nanoTON, perhaps checking current price for a same-length domain.

Devsyn: Because I wouldn't like to create all the logic for a wallet software. I don't want to recreate the wheel. I noticed if I use TonConnect, the user would be redirected to confirm a transaction on the wallet he connected. I would like to let he do confirmations etc inside my app.

Devsyn: But I don't know if there is something that turns this possible on TON

Devsyn: Otherwise I'll need to create a logic like a wallet

&rey: Perhaps you want that user confirms requests of your app inside that app itself? (reply to 152816)

Devsyn: Yes, exactly hahaha (reply to 152820)

&rey: Then you would be best removing TC2 and creating your own module, @ton/ton-based, providing sendTransaction method.  DO NOT import existing mnemonics for users, in name of security. Generate a new wallet, store its keypair on frontend (preferably with some recovery option but I'm not sure which) and make user deposit a bit there; then, your app will be able to spend with JS. (reply to 152821)

&rey: Or perhaps you want a payment channel? It is very similar in nature.

Devsyn: Ok (reply to 152822)

Devsyn: Maybe, I'm still exploring TON ecosystem (reply to 152823)

Devsyn: I don't know how payment channels works yet

Devsyn: But the thing is: I want the user to confirm transactions without the need to leave the app, otherwise it would break all the UX

Devsyn: I think the only way to turn this possible is letting the user import/create a wallet. But I am not sure yet ü•≤ (reply to 152827)

&rey: Please DO NOT import. Generate a new keypair using @ton/crypto. (reply to 152828)

Devsyn: Yes, I think I'm going to use this method. (reply to 152830)

Devsyn: Thanks for your help! ü´∂

M: Hey ! I'm trying to understand bounced messages and when does a message produces a bounce. If it can do it in every phase (compute phase , action phase )??  Let's suppose I'm sending jettons from jeton-wallet A to jetton-wallet B. If the message fails in the first compute phase, ie in wallet A execution of the code there will be a bounce message to the originating sender address  if the internal message was marked as bounceable??  If the message fails in action phase in wallet A (when sending raw message to wallet B ) there will be a bounce message to the originating sender address if the message was marked as bounceable? or to wallet A?   Once the message arrives to jetton- wallet B and the transaction fails in compute phase that message will bounce if the original message was marked as bounceable?  thanks in advance

M: my understanding is that bounces only happen in compute phase but there's a special case where they can happen in action phase when using  SEND_MODE_BOUNCE_ON_ACTION_FAIL  as mode is that correct?

Mary: Hello I made a nft collection that uses the 0062-nft-standard on ton testnet network(for now) What i want to make is a smart contract using tact language (using blueprint (npm create ton@latest)) That will take a fee from the user + mint a nft on that collection with the data i need and send the nft to the user (and send the remaining amount to my wallet) But i cant figure out how to mint nft on the collection It seems like the smart contract should be the owner of the nft collection which i can do But even after that, i cant mint a working nft_item on the collection using tact language and the smart contract I have done some stuff on the testnet and i can provide the transaction links to you in your direct if you want to check them Can you guide me?

Spyder: What is wrapped Ton

&rey: The name for any TEP-74 jetton which can be interconverted with TON 1:1 modulo fees. Used to unify asset handling in complex systems, and so that actual value cannot be burned for computation.  If you received a jetton, even calling itself "wrapped TON", unprompted, then it might be scam. (reply to 152927)

Litinski: Hi everyone! Guys, please tell me if anyone has encountered a similar problem the essence is that when focusing on input the whole page is re-rendered and it happens only on IOS  I bet that this is somehow related to the fact that I use "reactive" libs like rxjs and at the moment when the keyboard should appear the viewport is triggered which causes the re-rendering of components that are the pipelines for streams which in turn triggers the re-rendering of everything else, but why is this happening? keyboard should appear, the viewport is triggered which causes the re-rendering of the components that are bundling for streams which in turn triggers the re-rendering of everything else but why this works for androids I don't understand  any ideas would be appreciated.

Nerses: While doing Jetton transfer in Blueprint sandbox can forwardPayload be specified ?

&rey: You should construct the message yourself. Please refer to TEP-74 over existing examples since they have fragile behavior over forwardPayload's tag bit.  ... forward_ton_amount:(VarUInteger 16) forward_payload:(Either Cell ^Cell) = ...  means that, after specifying the amount, you must store either 0 (and then forward payload inline, if any), or 1 and a reference.

&rey: I recommend that you do not use whatever suggested you the current SendParameters, and I'll now send a better option.  I assume you do not need a comment in forward payload? (reply to 153840)

Syv: Greetings everybody

Ackermann: Please I need help, does anyone know how to convert a pubkey to a uint256 pub key. I want to integrate payload for my contract abd that's needed

&rey: You could probably just storeBuffer? (reply to 153954)

Ackermann: I do not understand (reply to 153955)

&rey: Which language, what's the type of public key you have, which type do you want to get? (reply to 153956)

Ackermann: tact (reply to 153958)

&rey: (TypeScript, Buffer, Builder) ‚Äì> builder.storeBuffer(k) (reply to 153958)

&rey: (Tact, ?, ?) (reply to 153959)

Ackermann: i have a ED25519 Public-Key   trying to convert to uint256

&rey: But Tact does not have "ED25519PublicKey" type. What's the type which you have, in a variable that is?  If you haven't decided, you can store publicKey: Int as uint256 and then it won't be problem on Tact side. (reply to 153963)

Ackermann: I know tact doesn't

Ackermann: It's off chain, i neeed it to sign payload and send to the contract in order to use the check_signature() method

Ackermann: This is how i want to store it, now how do i generate a uint256 pub key (reply to 153964)

Syv: Hi, does ton currently have a social thats fully blockchain based like zora yet?

&rey: I don't know of such, if https://ton.app/social does not contain one. (reply to 153983)

Syv: they are fake, they all use central servers. maybe ton for auth and thats it (reply to 153984)

&rey: Well TON whitepaper contained a whole section saying that implementing a social app inside blockchain is too costly therefore all the other infrastructure parts are justified too. (reply to 153985)

Syv: i think that being costly is part of being immune to bots (reply to 153986)

&rey: More costly than that. After all, you would replicate all the social network mechanisms ‚Äî either on client, which has ultimately limited vision into blockchain (because of network bandwith), or on four hundred validators. The load is increasing hundredfold over what networks do. (reply to 153987)

Syv: Yeah your absolutely right on that one, scalability is a big issue here

crypvolk: this is TON in my Telegram settings (My TON), and not in the wallet app, just to clarify

&rey: There is no one in this chat who can help you with custodial services like Telegram Wallet. Please mind that people who would DM you are most often scam. (reply to 154161)

crypvolk: didn't refer to you as custodial support, nor is it necessary? (reply to 154165)

&rey: If there is some amount of TON and they are not in blockchain on your wallet contract, then they are held by a custodian. Telegram, apparently. And then we go to step one, which is, only Telegram can say what to do with those. (reply to 154163)

Code: I just heard of Tolk‚Ä¶ so there‚Äôs now both Tolk and Tact?   Which one do you guys recommend I use as a new TON dev?

Gustavo: So many attackers I'm also suffering a scam ü•π (reply to 154494)

&rey: IMHO Tolk is better in that does not mask the blockchain-related parts. Tact does, and it works until it comes back to bite you (e.g. if you forget that you cannot call get-methods of other contracts). (reply to 154558)

Ivan: Hello. Where can I see the docs for deploying the Highload Wallet V3 contract? The official TON Docs has the bare minimum of information, maybe someone has a ready-made solution

Daniel: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/highload-wallet-contract-v3 (reply to 154636)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Does it matter, transaction-duration-vise, if I use TON from Japan? There're some nodes here, are they going to produce blocks in a lagging-behind-way because of the big ping with Europe where most nodes are located?

5b 44 43 54 5d: C# (reply to 154627)

&rey: Other than some milliseconds to receive your external message, it will work the same. After all, connection to you is no longer required to compute all the transactions. (reply to 154638)

&rey: if you know the list of features beforehand, you should also check out Rust (reply to 154627)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: The miliseconds you're talking about are the ping from me to the closest validator/liteserver? (reply to 154640)

&rey: To the main bulk of them, I would say. If you're sending the external to a Japanese server, it still has to be broadcasted in the overlay. (reply to 154642)

&rey: Essentially, the external needs to meet collator/validator producing one of the next blocks. More often than not, this node will be in Europe as the main bunch of them is.

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: From my observations, the collator is queued in a first-in-first-out way so I get a sense that it'd suck to send externals from Japan

&rey: Did you check message stats in practice, though?

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: message stats? (reply to 154646)

&rey: Time to mempool (though that is imprecise because Tonapi only checks at their nodes which are not in Japan), time to inclusion (even less precise because of block interval), drop rate. (reply to 154647)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Sounds like a good idea to test these, will do probably! (reply to 154648)

DARK ANGEL: Yes, of course I know, but Python is quite slow and I decided to learn a more complex and faster language (reply to 154635)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: javascript is the most powerful language ever (reply to 154656)

MojisolaüçÖ üçÖ: python is not slow.  have you reasoned why python is popular In AI, machine learning (reply to 154656)

&rey: because it merely invokes C or GPU-bound code which does the computations at hand.  That's somewhat off topic, isn't it? (reply to 154658)

&rey: We do not have a project bringing GPUs to TON after all.

DARK ANGEL: In AI, the speed of the language is not important, and python is used because of its simplicity (reply to 154658)

Teers k üêæ: https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-proxy-sites/how-to-run-ton-site  Alternatively, you can run the proxy in simple mode with an .adnl domain if you do not have a .ton or .t.me domain:  Is that means i can use name. t.me as TON html5 site or nah?

Teers k üêæ: if user opens "name. t. me" to open a website, is this possible?

Teers k üêæ: In simple i wanna use "name.t .me" as domain for my website

&rey: Yes, if that username is an NFT (as converted via Fragment). (reply to 154680)

Teers k üêæ: Is this command enough? ./tonutils-reverse-proxy-linux-amd64 --domain name.t.me (reply to 154684)

Combot: Combot has warned Maxey Liu (1/3) Reason: Word **** is not allowed

Maxey: Hi TON developers! üëã I recently built a Role Authority System for TON smart contracts using Tolk, and I‚Äôd love to get your feedback!  üí° Key Features: - Supports up to 256 roles for permission control, using efficient bitmask operations (inspired by Solmate)  - Permission check passes if any of the following is true:     1. The opcode is public (Public Capability)     2. The caller has the required role (Role Capability)     3. The caller is the contract owner  - Two-step ownership transfer with a built-in timelock for added security  ‚ùì Why I built this: Since 2023, I‚Äôve been building on TON and found myself rewriting similar permission logic and tests again and again.   This module aims to solve that by making permission control more standardized, efficient, and secure.  ‚≠êÔ∏è GitHub Repo: https://github.com/ipromise2324/tolk-auth  Happy to chat more if you have questions üí¨

Somyaditya: Hi guys, I need some help creating a transaction monitoring system for my application. I want to monitor smart contracts and wallets that initiate transactions from my platform. Is there any alternative to Tenderly?

&rey: The commonly suggested system is https://github.com/gobicycle/bicycle. Actually, I did not know of the one you mentioned. (reply to 154805)

MBA: Hey guys I am trying to create a LiteClientApi using c# the only resources I found was TonSdk.Net and I think they don't support trust checks for liteservers. I wanted to know is it necessary to do trust checks and proof checks for different adnl responses from liteservers or I can trust official liteservers (https://ton .org/global.config .json) and their responses?  And how can I be sure that account state and list of transactions a liteserver is giving to me can be trusted?

&rey: Generally speaking, you should not. What if key got leaked? (reply to 154852)

&rey: The easiest way IMO would be by reimplementing pytoniq.

MBA: So what is the best way to trace an account on blockchain and be sure that the data I am getting is 100% correct? I want to trace events being emitted in tact contracts and also some other transactions to check if I really received x amount of y token/ton. (reply to 154854)

Code: Will there be docs for TOLK soon?

Code: Actually why did TON announce Tolk without proper docs

Dmitry: Check several litesavers and compare their responses? (reply to 154856)

Punk: Maybe they need more time to actualised their docs (reply to 154876)

Code: doesnt answer question - i mean why launch if its not ready

Punk: Idk, sorry

&rey: Would there be any benefit to waiting? Now, big teams are already able to rewrite their contracts into Tolk to demonstrate its effectiveness, there is just enough information; otherwise, core team would have to do all the examples. (reply to 154904)

Artur: Hello everyone! How can I calculate init state of a contract in FunC? In Tact I need to import that contract and do smth like let init: StateInit = initOf ContractName(...)

&rey: This is chat about development on TON, yes. https://docs.ton.org/ is docs about same. (reply to 154969)

Artur: Sorry for a stupid question, but how do I import contract code in FunC? I have this layout:/contracts   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contract_1.fc   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contract_2.fc I want contract_1 to be able to deploy contract_2, but I‚Äôm not sure how to get access to the code of contract_2 from inside contract_1. In Tact, I‚Äôd just writeimport "./contract_2"; ‚Ä¶ let init_of_contract_2: StateInit = initOf Contract2(); What‚Äôs the FunC way to do this? (reply to 154967)

&rey: You would compile contract2 on its own, obtain .boc binary file, encode it as HEX... (reply to 154971)

&rey: then create a function cell contract2code() asm   "B{B5E9...}"   "B>boc PUSHREF";
