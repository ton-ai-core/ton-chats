ETON: It didn't give any error and executed successfully. But it didn't delete a piece of dictionary data as I expected. The same deletion logic can delete a piece of dictionary data in other functions (reply to 88742)

&rey: Perhaps you forgot to save data? (reply to 88823)

Bogdan: Hey, everyone. Can someone tell me how to call a smart contract function from funC on the React? The contract is already deployed

&rey: Please check out https://docs.ton.org/develop/get-started-with-ton#preparing-mining-messages ‚Äî it is quite relevant, though not totally. (reply to 88836)

Nerses: how I can create message of this type message Commit{     data: CommitData; } struct CommitData{     hopChains: map<Int,StringImpl>;     hopAssets: map<Int,StringImpl>;     hopAddresses: map<Int,StringImpl>;     dstChain: String;     dstAsset: String;     dstAddress: String;     srcAsset: String;     srcReceiver: Address;     timelock: Int;      messenger: Address;     jettonMasterAddress: Slice;     jettonWalletCode: Slice;       amount: Int;  } to send it as field custom_payload in jetton transfer message ?

Nerses: here is how it is stored   let b_0 = new Builder();   b_0.storeDict(hopChains, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   b_0.storeDict(hopAssets, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   b_0.storeDict(hopAddresses, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   let b_1 = new Builder();   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstChain);   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstAsset);   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstAddress);   let b_2 = new Builder();   b_2.storeStringRefTail(srcAsset);   b_2.storeAddress(srcReceiver);   b_2.storeInt(timelock, 257);   b_2.storeAddress(messenger);   b_2.storeRef(jettonMasterAddress);   b_2.storeRef(jettonWalletCode);   let b_3 = new Builder();   b_3.storeInt(amount, 257);   b_2.storeRef(b_3.endCell());   b_1.storeRef(b_2.endCell());   b_0.storeRef(b_1.endCell()); but anyway get error 130 => the contract doesnt accept such message type,although it implements that type

Nerses: and here is the transaction https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/0338e24f1dc8e019125f218eb0806f706a15f68e69ad6a007c54af8d696d672e

&rey: There probably should be opcode for Commit message. (reply to 88840)

Nerses: i have added this after all the code  const custom_payload = beginCell().storeUint(1734998782, 32).storeBuilder(b_0).endCell(); (reply to 88846)

Nerses: but still I got exit code 130   https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/6a2f3014a7793c527982c2d008cea83ff7ea18bf7542eb9efb7ccbf2d6e8e6c4

&rey: Well, .md file in build artifacts should explain that. (reply to 88848)

Nerses: Invalid incoming message  the exit code for 130. I thought it is generic exit code for every contract like -14 for example,thats why i didnt mention error message (reply to 88849)

Nerses: in case the message in custom_payload is created correctly why should i get such exit code ?

&rey: Contract accepts TokenNotification(0x7362d09c), right? (reply to 88851)

Nerses: yup (reply to 88852)

Nerses: shouldnt i pass it with forward_payload ? and in custom_payload I sent this message for receivers inner logic (reply to 88852)

&rey: In forward payload, of course. Custom is for jetton wallets. (reply to 88855)

Nerses: i passed that message as argument for field forward-payload  but got error Too many references .One can be Cell? another one slice as remaining. (reply to 88856)

Nerses: in case i change the type of argument in forward_payload to Slice I get Type 'Slice' is missing the following properties from type 'Cell': type, bits, refs, mask, and 10 more. (reply to 88860)

Adams: Thank you. However, the destination is a Tonkeeper wallet from a local wall. Please give examples of arbitrary comments you mean? Thank you once again. (reply to 88820)

Adams: Thank you so much üëç (reply to 88865)

Adams: Please, for the future reference: if I wish to send from a local wallet to an exchange like OKX or Binance, what will the comments look like and why the comments section while transferring Ton? (reply to 88865)

&rey: The exchange will generate a memo like 220330. You will need to set comment 220330 then. (reply to 88868)

Adams: I really appreciate your kind attention.   My best regards (reply to 88869)

Lego: Hi everyone! I'm looking for recommendations for an audit firm for the TACT smart contract. Any suggestions?

–û–≥—É—Ä—á—ñ–∫: Hi everyone, I have an idea, but I need specialists who can tell me if it's a bad idea or a good one, and I believe there are such specialists in this chat.  Here's my idea: For example, I have 10 accounts in the TON network that I generated based on a single public key and managed with a single private key, with each being assigned a different wallet_id during generation.  Clients will be transferring funds to these accounts, and I want the funds to be automatically transferred from these accounts to another one of my accounts upon receipt.  As I understand it, can I deploy a smart contract on each of these 10 accounts that will automatically transfer the funds to another account upon receipt?  Or is this not how it's done? I find it a stupid solution to write software that will scan the accounts in various loops, as it seems like smart contracts can handle this.  I don't quite understand how this would work yet.

&rey: Yes, you can do so. It will be a quite simple contract. (reply to 88993)

–û–≥—É—Ä—á—ñ–∫: perhaps do you have an example?üòÅ (reply to 88994)

&rey: () recv_internal() { send_raw_message(get_data(), 128); }  and set appropriate message in contract's data. (reply to 88996)

Frank: Hello, Team. Anyone can guide the course for writing  smartcontract in Rust? I mean smartcontract on the TON network.

&rey: 1. Fork Rust, deleting all reference business (making all types Copy); 2. Create compiler from Rust to TVM Assembly; 3. Write smart contract. (reply to 89089)

&rey: It is an idea I like, but very ambitious.

Frank: Yes, it is very challenge for me. (reply to 89095)

Frank: I'm checking ever_sdk, ever_block,  Can I write smartcontract and deploy using these packages?

&rey: You can write smart contracts in FunC. Most of them can also be made in Tact, though with increased gas usage.

&rey: 1. Those aren't built for TON; they seem to be for Everscale blockchain. 2. Probably you can't make a smart contract there, you need to compile it separately. (reply to 89098)

Frank: So there is no any example on rust smartcontract on TON, yet? (reply to 89100)

Frank: For now Func is the only way?

Frank: I found these packages by searching ton_sdk, ton_blcok. What about these packages? (reply to 89100)

&rey: got grants by whom, exactly? (reply to 89121)

Rishabh: By TON under TON grants program (reply to 89124)

&rey: There isn't a single entity called "TON" having money to issue grants. TON Foundation, perhaps? Or TON Society? (reply to 89125)

Rishabh: I don't bro. Just checkout TON official site there's a page called TON grants (reply to 89126)

Anton: from the UAHg project. We have noticed that certain individuals have created a token that mimics our project on the Ton network, directly inputting false data with links to the official resources of the real project. Dear colleagues, have there been any precedents for the removal of such tokens or deactivation of addresses with a token that is recognized as fraudulent? How can we address this issue?

&rey: TON Foundation grants, then. Grant updates are at bottom of the page, I think they are up to date. (reply to 89127)

&rey: not possible. Make sure that your users know address of official jetton master; perhaps include it in links as well, since those are kept? (reply to 89128)

Anton: Thx (reply to 89132)

Rishabh: Ohk. Then is there any list of projects which got grants? (reply to 89129)

Human: Tell me what is the latest working version of tonconnect ?

&rey: I don't know of one; you can compile it. (reply to 89136)

Rishabh: How can I compile it? Is there any source? (reply to 89139)

&rey: Sources = 1) grant updates at bottom of the page, 2) transactions from TON Foundation wallet (hard to filter, though). (reply to 89141)

Rishabh: Where at the bottom of the page? (reply to 89143)

&rey: This list: https://blog.ton.org/category/grants. (reply to 89145)

Rishabh: Ohk. So how does this grant program works?   Like does TON will give grants to two projects who are competitors in the same domain? (reply to 89146)

Hello everyone,  We are currently looking to collaborate with a professional agency that specializes in perfecting AI Crypto Bots and Mini Apps. Our goal is to enhance the functionality, performance, and user experience of our existing solutions.  Requirements:  Proven experience in AI and cryptocurrency-related projects. Expertise in developing and optimizing Telegram bots. Ability to create seamless mini apps with user-friendly interfaces. Strong portfolio showcasing previous similar projects. Excellent communication skills and ability to meet deadlines. If your agency fits this description or if you can recommend someone, please reach out to us with your portfolio and a brief overview of your approach to this project.  Looking forward to your responses!

Zain: Hey developers!  I wanted to hop-in and talk about TEP - targetted towards security.  We are trying to make TON easy, simple and user friendly, but this should also not comprimize on user security.  I wanted to start a discussion to talk more about the security of "mini apps" and how we can ensure they are not malicious.  After reading the WP it seems, TON has done a great work, but my idea is to deploy a safety tag that the user can set at their own end, which is displayed before connecting with any mini-app.  Keen to hear other devs on this idea.

Nekomya: When you first add the project to the liqid pool, the amount of tons put in and the pool prices affect the prices, so make sure you put it in a balanced way.  Since I didn't know this at first, I was caught in sniper bots, they deleted the liqid pool 2-3 times. - 400 ~ 500 USD  At the moment, it is very difficult to put money into the liqid pool because the price is unstable. This is just my experience, subject to. (reply to 89214)

Foxero: Thank you so much for the response, so there's no obligation to put a minimum amount of cash into a project? I can launch an app and choose the amount of cash? (reply to 89224)

rkonrock / "üå±SEED"/ üåä Wave: Hello admin please help me

Haq: Or any one know how to get USDT on testnet? the good one? (reply to 89282)

Aleks: Hey guys. Does TON have contract libraries/standards comparable to what OpenZeppelin offers on EVM?

.: Hi How to mint NFT with FunC?

Kingü•á: aha, ton-contracts will be help you (reply to 89292)

&rey: Within existing collection? (reply to 89292)

&rey: What functionality could such a library provide? I've heard of one existing, but it isn't that useful. (reply to 89291)

.: No, I want to mint NFT and collection with my FunC smart contract  For example, user send to smart contract 1 Ton, then smart contract create collection and NFT   Is it really ? (reply to 89294)

&rey: Yes, but absent other requirements it requires a contract architect to choose the best option to do so. (reply to 89296)

Haq: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/tutorials/collection-minting  Here you can start (reply to 89296)

Aleks: Like following the standards defined in the TEPs (reply to 89295)

.: Please, think first, then write This is guide with Node JS I need FunC (reply to 89298)

Haq: There you can read about NFT on TON, what you will need for your collection.  And also there are more resources about NFT and FunC.  That's way i wrote "Here you can start" (reply to 89301)

Bogdan: Hi everyone. Is there a function template for sending a Jetton coins to a specified address, such that only the recipient has to pay for the transaction?

&rey: No, it isn't even possible. (reply to 89310)

Bogdan: üò¢ (reply to 89311)

Nekomya: If such a thing happened, everywhere would be filled with scam users ‚ò†Ô∏è (reply to 89310)

Bogdan: I got it. I just wanted to make a game where you could get a reward for quests in jettons (reply to 89314)

Bogdan: Maybe it's done differently or maybe I just don't understand it right

.: Hi  I use example from docs for transfer NFT  But I got error with op::transfer (op::transfer() is not defined)  How to fix ?

&rey: 1. remove parens to get simply op::transfer 2. define const int op::transfer = 0x and HEX code from TL-B. (reply to 89319)

&rey: So, in your idea user gets jettons but they need to pay transaction fee, right? (reply to 89316)

Bogdan: yes (reply to 89321)

&rey: So, you need a system similar to payment channels, but single-directional (where only server sends jettons to user) and non-closeable. (reply to 89323)

DEGGAN | Dropsüíß: hi I want to ask. when I import my ton wallet from Telegram to Tonkeeper, why my address different?

&rey: Fully different or just a few characters in beginning and end? (reply to 89325)

&rey: Different wallet versions, probably. (reply to 89327)

Nekomya: Check your wallet is different from the main wallet and Tonspace (reply to 89325)

DEGGAN | Dropsüíß: so which one is correct? (reply to 89328)

&rey: Both? They are different accounts, indeed, but both might be yours. (reply to 89330)

DEGGAN | Dropsüíß: i import the phrase from tonspace beta to tonkeeper (reply to 89329)

DEGGAN | Dropsüíß: Ton network is build different than EVM? (reply to 89331)

Nekomya: It depends on which one you want to open in Tonkeeper. If you want to use Tonspace, here are the steps in order: Wallet     ‚è¨ Ton Space      ‚è¨ Settings      ‚è¨ Copy your 12-digit code     ‚è¨ Open and import the tonkeeper. (reply to 89332)

&rey: No unless you are its admin. (Testnet is not different from mainnet in most regards.) (reply to 89336)

Haq: Ok, hmm maybe you can how to get some USDT on testnet?  I need to write and test smartContracts which will receive USDT and store them (reply to 89338)

&rey: Get some other jetton via https://minter.ton.org/?testnet=true. (reply to 89339)

Ivan: Is there a service to catch transaction status by webhook in TON Network. like Alchemy ?

Tanya: Hello, devs. how to get a JettonWallet address from my Ton wallet?

&rey: Pretty easily (https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#how-to-calculate-users-jetton-wallet-address-offchain). (reply to 89346)

Tanya: what is this? (reply to 89347)

Ivan: Why address in TON transaction can be differ that wallet address?

Ivan: I'm using https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/master/example/accept-payments/main.go

Ivan: But message in logs show me different address then my sender wallet

&rey: Is it fully different or just a few characters in beginning and end? (reply to 89356)

Ivan: fully.. should be UQCfSNO_5T4YROw-nI4jOUjQnWmIJj_DpG38de0j4HXByphn but comes EQCfSNO_5T4YROw-nI4jOUjQnWmIJj_DpG38de0j4HXBysWi here is a transation: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/75d18101ab3152bd1fc8c6a0db45e958aa548145dbe08b78210a4600a1774526 (reply to 89357)

&rey: Just a few characters, alright. Different address forms (you expect non-bounceable, get bounceable). (reply to 89358)

Ivan: Thanks, but where did you see a few characters ?

Ivan: Ohhh..after -

&rey: .QCfSNO_5T4YROw-nI4jOUjQnWmIJj_DpG38de0j4HXBy... is same (reply to 89361)

Ivan: Can you tell how to convert it to bounceble ? (reply to 89360)

&rey: I don't know Go so I can't. (reply to 89365)

Ivan: to whom it can help, in Go it can be done this way  ti := tx.IO.In.AsInternal() src := ti.SrcAddr src.SetBounce(false)

Ivan: So if user connect (link) his wallet in web3 dApp it always be shows as non-bounceable ?

Ivan: So I can rely on it and link payments based on that flag?

&rey: Appropriate format of user address is usually non-bounceable. (reply to 89373)

Ivan: In the near future, all wallets in TON are transitioning to the non-bounceable format, so don't be surprised if, using the same key, you see different address formats in different wallets. It depends on the developers of the specific wallet and the format they have chosen, but official services will tend to adopt the new format.  Is that true info?

Ivan: Is there method in SDK to get all options in array? So I can check it at once ?

Ivan: like isValid('bounceble-address', 'sender-address')

Ivan: nvm, found docs üôÇ https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#what-flags-are-there-in-user-friendly-addresses

Vladislav: Have a nice day everyone üëã I use react and the @ton/ton package  My goal is to receive a transaction just sent via @tonconnect/ui-react and wait for its final result: success or failure and get the exitCode in this case  I receive targetBoc from the response of sending a transaction via tonconnect. Then I interpret it in hash with the following code: const hash = Cell.fromBase64(targetBoc) .hash() .toString("base64");  Then in a loop with some frequency I receive and analyze transactions using the code: const lastTxs = await client.getTransactions(walletAddress, { limit: 10, hash: hash });  for (const lastTx of lastTxs) { const txDescription = lastTx.description; if (txDescription.type !== 'generic' || txDescription.computePhase.type !== 'vm') { console.log(txDescription); continue; }  Until I find my transaction among the transactions by comparing hashes: if (lastTx && lastTx.inMessage) { const msgCell = beginCell().store(storeMessage(lastTx.inMessage)).endCell(); const inMsgHash = msgCell.hash().toString("base64");  if (inMsgHash === hash) { console.log("This is our transaction");  But then I don't understand how to understand whether the transaction is successful, my unsuccessful and successful transactions differ only in: lt, storageFeesCollected and body data and other hashes And also actionPhase is created and executed successfully for all transactions "actionPhase": { "success": true,  But the flags bounce: true and bounced: false for outgoing messages and incoming, if any, remain unchanged TonKeeper understands that the contract has issued an error and marks the transaction as unsuccessful. The contract produces an error using require  So how do you understand that the transaction is successful or unsuccessful?

Vladislav: Exit code 62972  as someone wrote is Invalid balance, https://t.me/tondev_eng/17625  from your code example:         // Update balance         self.balance = self.balance - msg.amount;          require(self.balance >= 0, "Invalid balance");  You are probably trying to send more than you have in your wallet. (reply to 89488)

Stephan: The fact is that after the deployment, I sent tokens to the contract (1000). (reply to 89489)

Vladislav: Yes, I saw that you have 1000 tokens. And how much are you requesting in the transfer?  If such an error occurred, and you did not change the code, then the attempt to withdraw is greater than the available amount (reply to 89490)

Stephan: self.tokenValue = ton("100");  Here. It‚Äôs enough (reply to 89491)

Nel_Z_I: I'm not a developer, but I'm in a few private groups for Web3 founders and have friends who are founders too. They often need developers. If you're a developer and interested, send me a DM.  Just a heads up, opportunities might not come up all the time, so keep your expectations in check.

Pibu: I actually found a way - compiled the minter and wallet, got their outputs from the build folder and used Cell.loadFromBoc() and I can deploy the minter from my test (reply to 89486)

Haq: Hey Man, did you found a way how to check is transaction was success? (reply to 89485)

Vladislav: I'm not sure, but it seems you're sending to the address of the tone wallet, not to the address of your token wallet (reply to 89496)

Vladislav: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQAXImSI3108Buwn-qRVgW-YM8Qde2NgT-3VZElnrwRzE57T/jetton/kQC2C3NAI10BnSK96hO_fBpAZ4dr8Pc8vXT77qQrKrh7bSaM  here you can see the holder address and the wallet address  try  the first one (reply to 89496)

Stephan: I know, but I also tried to send the message to JettonWallet, it also doesn‚Äôt work (reply to 89500)

Stephan: But even if this is the case, why does the error 62972 Invalid Balance come out? (reply to 89499)

Vladislav: well, yes, you are right, the execution occurs in this case precisely on the contract of your token wallet. Otherwise, the error would not be like that at all (reply to 89503)

Vladislav: yes, first step is this article https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-ton-transactions-how-to-track-transaction-results-and-utilize-tonclient-b992336eb3a3  and after this line: if (inMsgHash === hash) {  You can use this code block const computePhase = lastTx.description.computePhase; if (txDescription.type !== 'generic' || txDescription.computePhase.type !== 'vm') { // I'm not sure if I should use "vm" here too return; }  if (!computePhase.success) { const exitCode = computePhase.exitCode; console.log(exitCode); return; }  // Here it turns out the transaction was executed successfully  Something like that, I hope I helped (reply to 89498)

Stephan: to: contractAddress(initContract),   And how do I pass JettonWallet instead of this parameter while writing the script? That is, you can try after deploying and sending the token (and not before, as it was in the contract) to find out the exact Jetton Wallet of the sender and contact him already. As an option

Vladislav: your token wallet address should be and can be calculated based on the contract code and the input parameters of the initialization method  and also in the example code of the lesson that you threw - the master contract has a method for getting the initialization state, which can be used to get the wallet address virtual fun getJettonWalletInit(address: Address): StateInit { return initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), address); } then you pass the received StateInit to export declare function contractAddress(workchain: number, init: StateInit): Address; contractAddress from the '@ton/core' package  But I didn't do it that way, I did it differently: I took its class from the compiled contract code, say JettonWallet, and then used the following code: const jetteonWalletInit = await JettonWallet.fromInit(initArg0, initArg1, ...); const jettonWallet = client.open(jetteonWallet);  const jettonWalletAddress = jettonWallet.address In my case client is TonClient from '@ton/ton' package I guess that's all I can help you with :)  UPD:  Example code also has this getter     get fun get_wallet_address(owner: Address): Address {         let winit: StateInit = self.getJettonWalletInit(owner);         return contractAddress(winit);     } (reply to 89508)

Faithful1ofall: Do you need a paid. Consultation (reply to 89512)

Vladislav: sorry, I don't think so :)  I've only been messing around with the TON-network for the second week. I'm just trying to help newbies like me. Because there is often silence in the chat and scanty responses  UPD: sorry, I read it wrong (reply to 89513)

-/-: Hello, everybody. I'm on a research about TON and there is something im wondering about. Can somebody give me information about when to use FunC and when to use Fift?

Key - NEVER DM FIRST: Hi sir i have built a mini app, it works fun on desktop and ios , but it shows nothing on andriodÔºåhave anyone met this problemÔºü

-/-: I mean I understand that the Fift is a way low-level and better for direct interaction between TVM and contract but I cannot really find a real-world case for that (reply to 89706)

&rey: TVM assembly (commonly confused with Fift) can be used when you need certain placement of values on stack, or invoke some instructions directly. FunC is type-checked, on other hand. (reply to 89706)

-/-: So, can we say it like; Fift is for kind of "complex memory management" in TVM? (reply to 89709)

&rey: For instance, it is quite hard to rewrite such code in FunC: tuple digitize_number(int value)   asm "NIL WHILE:<{ OVER }>DO<{ SWAP TEN DIVMOD s1 s2 XCHG TPUSH }> NIP";

-/-: Okay but cannot i invoke instructions directly via FunC? (reply to 89709)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: Hey, How can I track the outcome status of transaction after sending using TonClient

Abdulaziz: On ton blockchain address can be wallet address, or smart contract or token or anything, right?

&rey: Yes. In particular, wallets are smart contracts. (reply to 89715)

-/-: @pcrafter , any idea on that? (reply to 89712)

&rey: You can (using asm intrinsics, though), when types of inputs and outputs can be written down. (reply to 89719)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: const TonWeb = require('tonweb'); const tonweb = new TonWeb();  async function checkTransaction(txHash) {     const response = await tonweb.net.queryCollection({         collection: 'transactions',         filter: { id: { eq: txHash } },         result: 'id, status, error'     });      const txDetails = response.result.data[0];     if (txDetails.status === 'success') {         console.log('Transaction successful');     } else {         console.log(Transaction failed with error: ${txDetails.error || 'Unknown error'});     } } r

Nerses: Hello everyone,  I'm excited to share a project I've been working on! We've developed a new protocol called PreHTLC, an evolution of the traditional HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contract) designed for crypto asset transfers. This protocol aims to facilitate truly permissionless and trustless cross-chain asset transactions.  We're providing a user-friendly UI along with the necessary links and access to our GitHub repository for those interested in diving into the code or providing feedback.  Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!  UI: https://layerswap.io/v8  GitHub: https://github.com/layerswap/layerswap-atomic-bridge

&rey: One lock can process at most 32K messages, right? Alright, seen that you delete inactive locks/commits. (reply to 89976)

&rey: I believe it would be best to put some thought into optimization. For instance, do something like     receive(msg: Unlock) {         let ctx: Context = context();         let lock: HTLC = self.locks.get(msg.data.hashlock)!!;         require(lock.timelock < now(), "Not Passed Timelock");         require(!lock.unlocked && !lock.redeemed, "Invalid State To Unlock");                      if (lock.sender == ctx.sender) {             send(SendParameters{                                 to: ctx.sender,                                 bounce: false,                                 value: lock.amount,                                 mode: 64                             });         } else {             send(SendParameters{                     to: lock.sender,                     bounce: true,                     value: lock.amount,                     mode: 0                 });             send(SendParameters{                     to: ctx.sender,                     bounce: false,                     value: 0,                     mode: 64                 });         }          self.locks.del(msg.data.hashlock);     }

&rey: (In fact, there is no place where unlocked would be set to true.)

Nerses: It will be optimization in context of compute fees,won't it ? (reply to 89978)

Nerses: as I delete it,I think there is no need to change state of unlocked (reply to 89979)

tony: Hello everyone! We are a team dedicated to building the TON ecosystem. We have developed several AI bots to assist with development. Currently, we have three bots: a bot to help with the issuance of Jetton tokens, a bot to assist in writing Tact, and a TON documentation assistant bot. We welcome everyone to give them a try!

Nerses: why it is better to use mode 64 than 0 in that case ? (reply to 89978)

&rey: Because it deducts TON used for computation fees. If you sent all of ctx.value back, contract would pay for computations on it, and that's not stable. (reply to 89985)

0xbera: what is the difference between external and internal messages in TON?

.: Hi, I have question, if I mint NFT, I will get on my address or collection address  ?

&rey: Externals come from outside of blockchain. Internals are between contracts and thus carry TON. (reply to 89999)

0xbera: so, external messages cannot carry TON? (reply to 90001)

&rey: Yes, because there is no TON outside of TON Blockchain. (reply to 90002)

0xbera: thank you - is something like this possible in TON 1. wallet-A prepares a message for wallet-C (msg-1) 2. wallet-A sends the prepared mssage (msg-1) to an intermediate wallet (wallet-B) 3. wallet-B sends msg-1 (prepared by wallet-A) to wallet-C  ??

kapil: A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.

0xbera: I was reading the source code for xssnick/tonutils-go and it sends all messages as external messages via the following line   err = c.client.QueryLiteserver(ctx, SendMessage{Body: req.ToBOCWithFlags(false)}, &resp)   I was wondering how fees are paid / deducted from the sending wallet..? (reply to 90001)

&rey: If contract (user's wallet) accepts the external, it pays its processing fees. (reply to 90021)

0xbera: ah - I see - thank you!

Nerses: I used this code from compiled files of my project,while trying to use it I get wrror too much referecnes but the maximum count of references I have is 4 which is ok.Can someone hint what can be the problem ?   let b_0 = new Builder();   b_0.storeDict(hopChains, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   b_0.storeDict(hopAssets, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   b_0.storeDict(hopAddresses, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   let b_1 = new Builder();   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstChain);   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstAsset);   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstAddress);   let b_2 = new Builder();   b_2.storeStringRefTail(srcAsset);   b_2.storeAddress(srcReceiver);   b_2.storeInt(timelock, 257);   b_2.storeAddress(messenger);   b_2.storeRef(jettonMasterAddress);   b_2.storeRef(jettonWalletCode);   let b_3 = new Builder();   b_3.storeInt(amount, 257);   b_2.storeRef(b_3.endCell());   b_1.storeRef(b_2.endCell());   b_0.storeRef(b_1.endCell());    let b = new Builder();    const forward_payload = b.storeUint(1734998782, 32).storeBuilder(b_0).asCell();

Raf: Thank you this is my Wrapper code to get balance , just slightly different    async getBal(provider: ContractProvider) {     const result = await provider.get('get_bal', []);     return result.stack.readCell().beginParse().preloadCoins();   } (reply to 90063)

&rey: Error usually points at specific line. Where does it point in this case? (reply to 90065)

kapil: What is the use of the msg value in the internal msg

ùòàùò≠ùò¶ùòπùò¶ùò∫: Hi (reply to 89407)

&rey: It allows contract to get how much TON were sent to it in the message. (reply to 90069)

Raf: @pcrafter i pushed this simple contract on github, it's supposed to just store TON right now, does it have security issues / or do you have any remark/guidance about it ? https://github.com/fabcotech/ton-func-contracts/blob/main/contracts/bank.fc

Nerses: I use it in ts script to intercat with smart contract.The error i get is Error: Too many references at ........(all files in node_modules)  and at line within the same script.The line is   await contractProvider.send(walletSender, { value: toNano("0.2"), bounce: true }, tokenTransferMessage); (reply to 90067)

&rey: Then probably error occurs within contract? (reply to 90073)

&rey: Yes, this contract has issues. in_msg_body~load_coins() cannot be trusted; you should add msg_value instead. (reply to 90072)

Nerses: i dont think it would be in contract,as i use that long script as forward_payload   for Jetton Transfer,and also when i comment one  of the storeDict  it works (although in that case contract as forward-payload gets invalid message throing exit code 130[invalid message]) (reply to 90074)

&rey: How is forward_payload converted into tokenTransferMessage?

Nerses: as forward_payload is Cell field within in tokenTransferMessage i pass all that aggregated data as argument for the field forward_payload (reply to 90078)

kapil: @pcrafter can you testing code for the jetton transfer token

Nerses: Slice as remaining is type for  forward_payload,i am mistaken.I pass the vraiable in previous code snippet (reply to 90079)

After testing in the browser, I noticed that everything works correctly and the wallet is disconnected correctly .What could be the problem?

Raf: @pcrafter When we deploy a contract with example toNano('0.05') (=50000000) as msg.value. This amount of TON is stored as balance of the contract right ? Just want to make sure.

kapil: Difference between the msg_value and jeeeton amount

Raf: msg_value is the amount of TON attached to the transaction, TON is the native asset of the blockchain, just like ETH is for Ethereum mainnet (reply to 90095)

kapil: I want to ask want is difference when we are sending the amount in the msg body and value in the internal message

&rey: can be arbitrarily set by sender. (reply to 90097)

&rey: Value of internal message is checked by validator.

kapil: Can you elaborate more

kapil: ... (reply to 90100)

Abdulaziz: I heard that a smart contract must pay rent during its existence, that is, all tokens and wallets are smart contracts, does this mean that the NFT can disappear from the wallet? Explain please

ùòàùò≠ùò¶ùòπùò¶ùò∫: I am not an employee of the TON Foundation. I am Pavel Durov from my second account, but several dozen people have already declassified me.   But seriously, I'm an ordinary person, and I was lucky to buy such a domain and link it to a zero address (reply to 90091)

ùòàùò≠ùò¶ùòπùò¶ùò∫: The payment there is so microscopic that the contract can live for several years without transfers. (reply to 90105)

Abdulaziz: NFTs also pay? (reply to 90108)

Abdulaziz: What's actual gas fee for minting nft with smart contact?

ùòàùò≠ùò¶ùòπùò¶ùò∫: Each NFT has a certain amount of TON to operate. If they run out, you will then have to pay a slightly higher commission to send NFT. (reply to 90109)

kapil: Value and amount (reply to 90100)

&rey: Around 0.02 TON should be left on NFT contract, so including collection update that should be near 0.03 TON. (reply to 90110)

sunyoki: what's the difference between this address calculation and the address calculation in jetton's warehouse

&rey: Both are writing the same bit-ref sequence in different ways.

sunyoki: Is it the same

Tom - Bushi: two nft questions: 1. I want the metadata to be stored on IPFS. Does that mean that the item's individual_content should store this IPFS link or is it found on the collection? 2. How can I get all the items owned by an address?

sunyoki: The first one is found in the TL-B document, which seems to be easier to understand

&rey: Common way is cell init = begin_cell().store_uint(6, 5).store_ref(code).store_ref(data).end_cell().

sunyoki: No matter what kind, including the one you sent, the result is the same, can be used

Blockchain: Hi, on contract, can I send multi send_raw_message?

Blockchain: with Func? I receive dict from client and each dict has wallet address and jetton amount, I want to send jetton to all addresses. is it possbile?

ùî∏ùïÑ: Hi everyone. I have specific question If you need to deploy contract with "coins" type field you can just use BigInt and then ~load_coins(). Easy. But what about dictionaries? When making dicts you have to provide exact amount of bits in BigInt. And here where i stuck. As far as i understand the size of coins value might be 128 bits long.  So it tried:   const allocation: Dictionary<DictionaryKeyTypes, bigint> = Dictionary.empty(                     Dictionary.Keys.Uint(32),                     Dictionary.Values.BigInt(128),                 ); but load_coins() fails here. But it works ok if i do load_uint(128).  Same with 64, 256 but only if i do load_uint(x). What could happen with load_coins()?  Thanks guys in advance

ùî∏ùïÑ:  (slice allocation_cs, int found) = allocation_data.udict_get?(32, whitelist?);          ifnot (found) {             throw(exc::tier_not_configured);         }         int allocation = allocation_cs~load_uint(256); ;; load_coins() not working here So currently i use 256 and it works but i am curious why load_coins() will not work here

ùî∏ùïÑ: I also tried both BigInt and BigUint if it makes sence

ùî∏ùïÑ: just loop the dict and call send_raw_message for each user. Here is my repo with hand-made jetton distributor using dicts. It's not perfect but could be a good example. It also has tests inside so you can make sure everything is working ok https://github.com/artemmartyhin/jetton-distributor (reply to 90722)

Just edit test/distributor.spec.ts  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { <‚Äî‚Äî change 10 to 1000             users.push(await blockchain.treasury(user${i}));         } and in test/distrubutor.ts  export const INITIAL_JETTON_BALANCE: bigint = toNano('1000.00');  extend to 100000.00 if u need 1000 users and the same result in tests

kapil: why the excess is not working can anyone tell me the reason

&rey: Last contract in that chain couldn't process the excess message. Somewhy it was sent to sender's jetton wallet.. (reply to 90816)

&rey: Bounce is automatic, happening if destination contract fails to process the message (for instance, if it doesn't have any code yet) and if sender specified that bounce may be run. (reply to 90787)

&rey: Ordinary users cannot send messages with "bounced: true" from their wallet in response to transactions which have happened.

sunyoki: The mandatory assignment is invalid, right? It's gonna be overwritten

Hankson: Hi guys, the EVM contract can deploy another contract. Can TON do this as well?

–ü–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å: I'm not familiar with JS, i tried to use it but failed (reply to 90827)

&rey: Yes. Just attach StateInit to the message. Btw are you familiar with TON address generation? (reply to 90829)

Hankson: üòÇ I'm not familiar with it. (reply to 90831)

Hankson: Any doc?

Eugene: Hi all! I've created a TON Site that opens perfectly in the browser using Tonutils-Proxy but doesn't open in Telegram  Sometimes doesn't open at all, sometimes the text loads without images and CSS   Do you have any idea what can be the problem?

Eugene: I can't post direct clickable link to the website here because of antispam, but it is paperplanes dot ton

Eugene: I see that Telegram uses intermediary websites on magic dot org  So for antonlukin dot ton there is antonlukin-dton dot magic dot org that's accessible even without proxy  But there is no paperplanes-dton dot magic dot org and I wonder why is that and how can I change it

User<745529128>: 1. You can host using the TON storage, then yes. Otherwise you need a reverse proxy to get an address in the TON network.  2. Yes, you can access using the adnl address or domain, but via proxy. (reply to 90845)

User<745529128>: i guess the answer might be https://bridge.ton.org/

Hankson: If bind a EVM address with a TON address, I can transfer toncoin between TON and EVM

Hankson: How did it work?  I mean program (reply to 90891)

MZ: I think I don't fully understand signature verification. I'd like to be sure, that connected wallet belongs to the user and save it to database.   I try to use this code to verify on backend: https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-with-react-ui/blob/master/src/server/services/ton-proof-service.ts.   As I see I need to generate payload "nonce", then user signs it during wallet connection and then there is the verification on backend. However, when I analyze that code I don't see payload "nonce" verification anywhere on backend. Am I missing something?  I assumed it should work like this: 1. I generate nonce on backend and save it to database. 2. User signs it during wallet connection. 3. I'm checking response from 2. on the backend and compare if nonce from point 1 is the same.  Does it work in this way? Where is the nonce verification on the backend then?

Almatbek: DM me (reply to 91138)

Alex: could anyone help me move coins from a pool on a validator onto a wallet? It seems like there may be a bug on my validator that prevents me from doing so...  Everytime I use withdraw_from_single_pool it actually adds 1.35 TON coin to it...

Alex: did you get it to work? (reply to 88124)

Hankson: Hi, guys. Does the TON wallet support a 12-word mnemonic? And does the TON mnemonic completely cover the EVM mnemonic?

sangmin: When I check it on tonscan, I don't see the jetton transmission record. I want to check the jetton transmission record using toncenter indexer, how can I track it?

Prince: recommend tonviewer (reply to 91162)

sangmin: I want to track it with the ton api interface. (reply to 91164)

Prince: sure you can

Prince: tonapi transaction you can see jettontransfer

&rey: Yes. Moreover, you can send payload in the same message and it will be processed as usual. (reply to 91108)

sangmin: Should I find out if it's a jettonttransfer in Opcode within the transaction??

sangmin: I only have InMsg Hash since sendboc.

Kowser |: TonWeb not support W5?

Rick: Is there a dedust api v3?

Shrish Yadav: Hi, can I create a mini app If the solidity smart contracts are deployed on an other blockchain, If not then is it mandatory to deploy those contracts on TON blockchain and will there be any changes in contract which I need to do?

yoshi~: Is there a significant indexing latency of tonapi? Is it more profitable in terms of latency and stability to use private liteserver or tonapi's indexing hardware is superior? The context is simple actions like getting wallet's balance and querying jetton metadata.

Matthew: hello my fellow indians

Casa: Hi I need a simple ton nft generating script. I am a newbie to ton chain. Could you guide me how to make it?

User<6623141573>: Hellow bros

User<6623141573>: How ya all doing mmm

&rey: You've probably wanted to ask this question about TON? Each transaction only works on one contract, so you need to do transfers from each wallet manually. (reply to 91210)

Shrish Yadav: can someone please help me re guarding this (reply to 91185)

&rey: Miniapp can work with EVM blockchains. Though this is chat about TON, and TON is very much not EVM-compatible. (reply to 91212)

ETON: I'm sorry, I sent you to the wrong group. I deleted it

Shrish Yadav: Thanks for replying, I have written a NFT marketplace in solidity smart contract and it‚Äôs deployed on bnb blockchain so can we use marketplace functionality using telegram app? or we have to deploy it on TON blockchain (reply to 91214)

Akachi: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQBkh2bzI-MaYgKne_9eLYSw4iCrQrD9CKT9zC_rsapym1u-?section=code  Hi, how can I verify this smart contract?

Lukasz: Hi guys I want create smart contract with new Jetton I clone repo from GitHub with smart contract from here  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter-contract.git  Next I need to install npm install   And what about this - npm create ton@latest Should I install this to project or not??  I try use function npm run build  in my smart contract from GitHub but this doesn‚Äôt works.  What I do wrong?

Lukasz: Help please!!

musashi: you use this command to create new blueprint project, so no need to run this command (reply to 91236)

Prince: you don't have to. (reply to 91217)

Assasin: Lt not in db..error...how to resolve this...when sending funds..to other address..  Any ideas guys?

K.: There are detailed instructions on how to deploy this contract from your computer in the README:  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter-contract?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions-1 (reply to 91236)

K.: https://verifier.ton.org/?testnet=true is for testnet üôÇ There's no switch in the app, sadly, but this works. (reply to 91226)

Lukasz: I did everything but I get error when try use npm run build. Error like no have installed funC.   And idk what should I do (reply to 91245)

Lukasz: 1 Make sure you have all "Dependencies and Requirements" as described in tonstarter-contracts repo.   So before I clone repo I should install this dependencies or not? There is npm create ton&latest (reply to 91241)

K.: Yes, absolutely.   npm create ton@latest does not install dependencies, it sets up a new project and not needed here. After you have cloned the minter-contract repo, you need to run npm install as the first thing to install the dependencies. You might need a FunC compiler as well: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-binaries. (reply to 91251)

Lukasz: So how instal this  dependencies when I open this file there I find another repo and in readme see command like npm create ton&latest but I don‚Äôt need this.   I try also install func compiler because I don‚Äôt have this at the moment

K.: There's no mention of npm create ton@latest in this repository you linked. (reply to 91251)

Lukasz: So what I should install apart npm install and clone repo? (reply to 91257)

Akachi: https://verifier.ton.org/EQBkh2bzI-MaYgKne_9eLYSw4iCrQrD9CKT9zC_rsapym-A0?testnet=  I tried, but can not verify. (reply to 91226)

Akachi: What do you mean? (reply to 91243)

Akachi: I tried true option, but still can not verify (reply to 91247)

Nerses: what indicates this Jetton wallet error 5 ¬∑ Integer out of expected range . more scpecifically what integer is mentioned about ?

Lukasz: Yea but there is info I need tonsttarter contract and when u open this there is link to new  version   https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint.git (reply to 91257)

User<69210164>: hello hello everyone!   I have a quick question about TON domains, I hope this specific chat is relevant to ask one: How can you renew an expired domain? The support told me to search here, but all 60 search results are not helpful at all and I can't find any details about it here.  I'm willing to pay $20 with an escrow/middleman for someone who helps me successfully

&rey: Renew? You can do so regardless of its expiry. (reply to 91279)

sunyoki: This is the code, isn't it forwarded to its own contract, it has no handler

sunyoki: üòÇ   inquisitive

Lucas: In Tonkeeper if you have your collectible sent there, there will be a button to renew... as i understand it... if you can... you'll wanna wait until like ONE hour before the expiry date to take care of it because regardless of when you execute the renewal it will always be for one year (reply to 91279)

Nerses: in this jetton transfer evrything worked correctly without any errors but why D contract havent done anything based on message which got with forward_payload ?

M: I installed mytonctrl2, and when I tried to run it with mytonctrl, it said: "Found new version of mytonctrl! Migrating!". So, I navigated to /usr/src/mytonctrl and attempted to run migrate.py, but I encountered this error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mypylib.mypylib'. This error occurred because the code includes from mypylib.mypylib import MyPyClass and from mytoncore.mytoncore import MyTonCore. It also has from mypylib.mypylib import run_as_root.  How can I migrate? How can I run this file?

Stephan: hello guys, please help, how do I link metadata to the nft and nft collections when deploying in the blueprint library?

Serhii: Guys, can someone recommend learning materials about low-level ton components like mempool, relay networks, validator work?  I‚Äôve read everything in docs.ton.org and whitepaper but it‚Äôs not enough.

yoshi~: Is there a significant indexing latency of tonapi? Is it more profitable in terms of latency and stability to use private liteserver or tonapi's indexing hardware is superior? The context is simple actions like getting wallet's balance and querying jetton metadata.

Pibu: hey everyone, I have a Root contract and Child contract. Child contracts are deployed per user address. User can do something in their contract and it sends a notification to Root. It is easy to discover the user contract by providing an address. But there is also a case when I get a string (let's say some code) and I need to find user's contract based on that string. I was thinking about using a dict (storing code -> user address) but as I understand this is not TON way. So am I correct to assume that it would be better to deploy a Child2 contract that maps that string to user and sends appropriate data to the Child user contract?

–ê—Ä—Ç—É—Ä: Hi guys! Could anybody explain this weird tact compiler behavior?

But when I try to specify some value in tons:   send(SendParameters{             to: self.bankWalletContractAddress,             value: ton("0.005"),             mode: 0,             bounce: true         });  compiler says "Error: Struct value is missing a field: body"

Nightfall: but if we are deep in the message chain, i.e   user wallet -> contract 1 -> contract 2 (failing here)  throwing error will just bounce back to contract 1, and if it does not process bounced message then the fund is stuck in contract 1, right? that being said, even if contract 1 processes bounced message, it will not even have the original sender address to send back the fund (since bounced message data is limited to under 256 bit of the original message, not enough to store the user address).  So in this case, should we catch the error in contract 2 and refund the user right away? (reply to 66695)

&rey: This is correct. (reply to 91783)

Nightfall: thanks! but in this case, the message from contract 1 -> contract 2 will not have an exit code, although it failed. So to determine if a particular function is successful or failed we have to do manually right? (i.e attaching more data - an exit code maybe - in the refund message) (reply to 91784)

&rey: Yes. Also, a good opcode to use in contract 2 => user wallet is 0xFFFFFFFF. (reply to 91785)

Nightfall: May I know why? Jetton uses 0xd53276db as excess opcode afaik (reply to 91786)

&rey: Because you are executing bounce, essentially? (reply to 91787)

Nightfall: oh (reply to 91788)

Nightfall: I did not think about that

Nightfall: I use the same opcode for refunding both in success and error cases

Nightfall: Will change that, thank you

Crypto noobie: Hi!  How can I implement coin transfers with fees on the TON blockchain using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend? I want to transfer coins from one user to another and also take a fee for each transaction.

&rey: Via TON Connect 2, you mean? (reply to 91854)

Crypto noobie: yes via ton connect

Crypto noobie: I want some guide, not asking for full implementation üôå

&rey: Visit TON Cookbook, token transfers are detailed there. To take fee, set responseAddress to your wallet and set outermost TON value to include that fee. (reply to 91856)

Crypto noobie: Thank you for the response. To confirm, based on the TON Cookbook example for token transfers:   await scaleWallet.sendTransfer(sender, toNano("0.3"), {   amount: amountIn,   destination: scaleVault.address,   responseAddress: sender.address,   forwardAmount: toNano("0.25"),   forwardPayload: VaultJetton.createSwapPayload({ poolAddress }), });   To confirm my understanding should I set the responseAddress to my wallet address to collect the fee? Is this correct? Also, can you confirm if the responseAddress is indeed used for collecting the fee or just for returning the gas fee to the sender?

Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn T√¢m: /

&rey: Jetton wallet returns unused gas (TON) to whoever is specified in responseAddress. (reply to 91860)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: Hi, can I ask why this transfer did not succeed in sending 0.07 TON to the receiver? The body:  const tx = walletContract.createTransfer({     seqno: seqno,     secretKey: keyPair.secretKey,     messages: [internal({         value: '0.07',         to: ADDRESS_TEST_2,         body: 'Test listen ton tx status!',         bounce: true // todo: check why set this true can not work?     })] })

&rey: This should be string in nanoTON instead. Or toNano('0.07') at least. (reply to 91969)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: I tried it but still not work. This is the tx: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/188f348c5d6919bef40eb844701b0c820b1c8c843f805cc5601fd48df43ac50a (reply to 91970)

&rey: Well, you asked for bounce if destination contract could not process the message, destination contract could not as it was uninit, so TON bounced.

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: How can I check if the destination contract can process the message or not? Or, should I always send my messages with the bounce flag set to false? (reply to 91974)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: I also read the bounce from the docs and it's said that we should not allow sends with unbounceable: It is a good idea not to allow the end user (e.g., of a wallet) to send unbounceable messages containing large amounts of value (e.g., more than five Toncoins) or to warn them if they do

&rey: You've read the full sentence, haven't you? (reply to 91976)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: So how to check if the destination contract can process the message? (reply to 91977)

&rey: Is ADDRESS_TEST_2 intended to be some wallet? If so, once you check that address is correct, bounce should be false.

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: ty, I get the point (reply to 91981)

Nerses: what is the proper way to use forward_payload  as body. Should it be converted ?  typescript      receive(msg: TokenNotification){         let ctx: Context = context();                 send(SendParameters{                                 to: myAddress(),                                 value: ctx.value,                                 bounce: true,                                 mode: 0,                                 body: (msg.forward_payload),                             }         );     }

Akachi: Is there any way to invoke the tx and execute using scan explorer like etherscan?

&rey: You can use msg.forward_payload.asCell() (though I think you don't want to send message to yourself in this case; just call appropriate function!) (reply to 92026)

Nerses: i want to send to my contract. Would it be better approach to use function for it ? (reply to 92029)

&rey: Yes, as each message incurs considerable forward fees. (reply to 92030)

Rjx: Hi Team,  I'm encountering an issue where the [TON_CONNECT_SDK] Bridge is reconnecting with a 5000ms delay. Could anyone provide insights into what might be causing this problem?  Thanks!

sangmin: I tried to check whether it was successful with exit_code value in complet_ph in the description, but there are transactions that do not have exit_code value.  help..

&rey: Why? You can just directly do the logic = update contract parameters, etc. (reply to 92046)

Nerses: now i get it.thanks for explanation (reply to 92049)

Nerses: does forward_payload¬†has such structure or it is just visualization¬†, so is it possible to get for example op_code¬†or value` ?

Chakra: ..

Nerses: let ctx: Context = context();         let op_code: Int = msg.forward_payload.preloadUint(32);         if (op_code == 1734998782){             // self._commit(Commit.fromSlice(msg.forward_payload), ctx);         }         if (op_code == 3995289619){             // self._lock(Lock.fromSlice(msg.forward_payload), ctx);         }     }   also same error get for this version. so it should occur only because of if statement.

Œõ≈Åƒ©: I used tonweb for transferring ton but why it refund every transactions    https://tonscan.org/address/UQDN8MT1l7IuFxmtFM3JQgQLv7NwcmUxYH__cHMu80d32fgK#events

&rey: That's called "bounce". (reply to 92132)

Œõ≈Åƒ©: I didn't get it actually (reply to 92134)

&rey: Almost all internal messages sent between smart contracts should be bounceable, i.e., should have their "bounce" bit set. Then, if the destination smart contract does not exist, or if it throws an unhandled exception while processing this message, the message will be "bounced" back carrying the remainder of the original value (minus all message transfer and gas fees). (reply to 92135)

&rey: addr.toString(true, true, false) (reply to 92140)

Joe: Hi, what if i send state_init to contract that is already inited? Will transaction bounce or init will be just skipped

&rey: Init will be skipped. (proof: jettons) (reply to 92151)

&rey: This should only be done once. (reply to 92150)

Nerses: so the second time when i do that operations the data already is cut and not exists,isnt it ? can preload be solution for it ? (reply to 92153)

Haint: Hey man, when sending a transaction that initiates a chain of messages between multiple contracts, how do I make sure that all the transactions have been confirmed?  await contract.sendUpdateSomething(); // using contract opened by TonClient    Is it correct that after this call we can say that all the transactions are confirmed?  I have seen people using seqno as a way to do the checking (if it increases then it's likely the transactions have landed) but I think it's not very reliable since the user can send another transaction elsewhere. (reply to 92162)

&rey: You can't. In general, you should wait until all effects are done. (reply to 92172)

Haint: do you mean I have to check the state? (for example, check if "something" is actually changed in the contract's storage) (reply to 92173)

&rey: Yes. Though, once first transaction of tree is sent, the others are bound to happen eventually. (reply to 92174)

Haint: I dont know tact, but the use of preloadUint might be a problem here (reply to 92333)

Haint: yes it is, the CommitData does not expect an opcode, the use of preloadUint will not modify the slice, so you end up passing the data with the opcode also

Haint: change it to loadUint

sunyoki: How did you get this trade hash

sunyoki: How do I know if the transaction is successful ü§£

&rey: "while it's still processing" does not make much sense, but common wallet cannot process two externals in the same block because of seqno protection (and emulation prefiltering of externals). (reply to 92360)

&rey: Well, my wallet has a test script, and it involves using plugins. That code can be as-is copied to wherever plugins need to be manipulated. (reply to 92314)

&rey: You can send same message cells several times (generally, until it is recorded or deadline expires). (reply to 92349)

&rey: One party can deploy a smart contract locking their tokens, which would release them to whomever pays appropriate amount of second token. (reply to 92348)

&rey: No, validators guarantee that source addresses cannot be forged. (reply to 92322)

&rey: Unfortunately if you learn Tact you will face mostly the same difficulties but attribute them to TON in general. (reply to 92291)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Hi everyone,  I am considering on developing a game on TON blockchain, but I have one question when it comes to the transaction fees that I don't understand.  My app would have a lot of small value transactions, but looking at the lost dogs for example (when I am buying BONES with NOT using Ton Space) I am getting fees of $0.3 per transaction, which I find a lot. I have tested sending NOT to a friend via TON space to mimic the transaction, and have seen that Telegram actually returns the excess funds (it has first told me that fee is going to be 0.1 TON but it was 0.017 TON in the end),  but I suppose that the network is not congested currently, and according to the docs, fee can go up to 1.05 TON (which could be around 5-10 dollars or more - depending on the TON price, which gives me the ETH and not Solana fees vibes)  TLDR: Are transaction fees on Telegram really this expensive, do you know of any plans to make them cheaper in the near future?    One more question, Why are some smart contracts such as the one from the Lost Dogs private and unable to be read? Only the 'assembly' code is visible, and the source code is hidden?  Isn't that the point of blockchain explorer?

Frol AnoGem: Hi there, can anyone explain to me how that formula works?   What is MIN/MAX parameters mean?

Vladimir: If developer verifies contract, you can see contract sources in places like TonViewer, otherwise you can see only TVM instructions (reply to 92382)

Nerses: is there a way to get blockhash in TON like is done in solidity ? https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#:~:text=blockhash(uint%20blockNumber)%20returns%20(bytes32)

SP: can i calculate txs hash from txs boc

cai: Yes, but Tact code is easier to read.ü§£ (reply to 92375)

&rey: What? Fees are constant. (reply to 92382)

&rey: The contract can be without source code if no one published said source code. After all, anyone can deploy a contract, and that requires only TVM assembly code.

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Why is so big fee for lost dogs for example, when buying bones with not coin?  Is their commission included in it, are that the smart contract expsneses? (reply to 92395)

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Is that fee for when sending any tokens to any sc?

&rey: It is usually lower, like 0.03 TON, but you do need to perform 3-5 transactions after all! (reply to 92399)

&rey: Wherever two jettons are involved, there are like 8 atomic transactions, more precise number depending on DEX.

Minimal ‚òÑÔ∏è: Hm, I am not sure I understand, still trying to get around the TON concepts, could you please translate that to this example:  Let's say I am building an app similar to lost dogs, it's going to receive and store couple currencies (let's say NOT, TON and USDT), and same as lost dogs, at the end of the day, I am going to take a % for myself and distribute the rest to the winners at the end of the day, but the difference is that there is going to be 5-15x daily transactions and they are going to be mostly low value (1, 5 or 15$), I'd like to know what would be TX cost for users when doing those transactions, or at last an interval (like between 0.01 and 0.03 TON)?  my main concern is how much would each TX cost for the users (because I am unable to reverse engineer lost dogs contract to see what they are doing inside and taking much more than 0.017 TON, if that is their commission or they have some expensive operations in their contract).

Kenny: Hi guys. I'm new to TON, and could anyone kindly help me understand the memory layout in TON? I know that memory in TON is based on cells. Unlike our computers, where the memory is based on bytes (or a large array of bytes). I know each cell can store up to 1023 bits, and can reference at most 4 other cells. As a result, we can only emulate the commonly seen data structures with some cells.  So am I working on a tree of cells, or on a DAG of cells? It seems that TON only limits the max number of cells one cell can reference, and it doesn't limit the number of cells which reference a cell.  The TON course says we are working on a tree of cells, but I think we are actually working on a DAG of cells. Which one is correct? Thanks!

Emma_dygli: /

Evgenii: for those struggling with the issue related to ton-connect manifest not found - recheck your SSL certificate on the server where the manifest file is placed. in my case I forgot to put the certificate chain. browser check passed well and everything seemed well. turned out that the wallet's party has way more sensitive SSL validation. it's good idea to check from tonkeeper mobile acc built-in browser if your manifest file can be opened.

MZ: Btw. do you recommend to just get jetton wallet once using code from the cookbook and save it or I should do it everytime, because it can change? (reply to 92519)

&rey: Once. (reply to 92526)

&rey: No jetton systems are deployed which would change their code. Moreover, it would be incompatible with pretty much any contract.

MZ: I don't get it. There is a variable for jettonMasterAddress and it's okay I'll paste there USDT master address, but what is userAddress? (reply to 92528)

&rey: userAddress is tonConnectUI.account.address ‚Äî whoever sends the token. (Jetton wallets are different for different users.) (reply to 92508)

MZ: I used this code and just get my wallet address finally. Meanwhile I expected to get USDT Wallet Address.  I thought it works similar to EVM, so: 1. I have USDT contract. 2. I use transfer function in USDT contact to transfer from wallet A, to wallet B.  So, I used in my code USDT contact address and expected to use a transfer function there and transfer tokens from wallet A to B.  How to do it properly? (reply to 92531)

&rey: No. In TON: user's USDT balance is stored in his separate jetton wallet contract. (reply to 92532)

&rey: So to use it message must be sent there.

Pibu: does anyone know about some articles/docs regarding running a local ton node? I'm starting mylocalton but I have no idea how to deploy my contracts to it. I'm using blueprint as well and I have the option to use a custom network but no matter what details I enter there it fails

MZ: Do you have any working github example where I can see jetton transfer code? (reply to 92533)

NPA120: It is an open source, mate (reply to 92537)

Pibu: here's a repo with reference jetton implementation https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft (reply to 92537)

&rey: Wait, you had one? Just fix the jettonWalletAddress and it's going to be fine. (reply to 92537)

&rey: Oh. Also fix forward TON amount. To zero, for lowest fees.

MZ: Ok, now I have this code, so used code from Cookbook, to obtain jetton wallet address, but it still doesn't work. (reply to 92540)

&rey: response_destination := tonConnectUI.account?.address forward_ton_amount := 0

MZ: Not sure where to change forward_ton_amount to 0, but changed responseDestination as you said and still getting error.  But now error number is 48. (reply to 92543)

&rey: .storeCoins(toNano(0.05)) // forward_ton_amount => .storeCoins(toNano(0)) (reply to 92544)

MZ: Yeah, finally works! Thank you very much! (reply to 92545)

MZ: Btw. I'm not sure if you use this package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui-react and if it's even official, but there is an error.   It connects properly when I run app on desktop, but it doesn't work in two cases:  1. When I try to connect using Chrome Responsive Mode (i.e. as iPhone 12). 2. When I try to connect when my app is open as Telegram Mini App on Telegram Desktop (macOS).  It even doesn't work on this official example: https://ton-connect.github.io/demo-dapp-with-react-ui/ (reply to 92545)

meomeocoj | Mike: We are on progress to docs stuff. Bassically, we implements based on IBC and RSQuad idea. (reply to 92700)

&rey: On TON, some processes can be run automatically, without you allocating any server to handle it.

MZ: @pcrafter I use a code from Cookbook to parse USDT wallet transactions, but the problem is that op of each transaction is equal to 395134233 which is 0x178d4519 in hex. As I see it corresponds to internal_transfer.   Meanwhile the code in the Cookbook has "if" only for 0x7362d09c which is transfer_notification.  Do you have any example of how to parse internal_transfer or should I do something differently?  I even tried to set destinationAddress in two fields on the screen instead of "tonConnectUI.account?.address" in response, but still doesn't work.   Here is the USDT Ton Wallet I'm trying to scan: https://tonviewer.com/EQCywXl0qspc31U5s_oY7KaLc43M-4s2SVPoa5vJnA-dg_1h

Kryptonite: can someone please let me know what should be my rpc url in mobile app config for tonkeeper testnet

&rey: Well, that is correct, you should adapt code instead to parse internal_transfer-s. (reply to 92749)

Then scan destination USDT wallet address using   const transactions = await tonClient.getTransactions(myAddress, {     limit: 5,   });  and all transactions have op === 0x178d4519 - so they are internal_transfer instead of transfer_notification.  How to get transfer_notification transaction then? (reply to 92757)

Apple: Hello

David: Hello!

Apple: Hi, I'm very interested in your custom wallet development.

MZ: In the cookbook there is an example of how to parse transfer_notification (0x7362d09c), but where can I find information of how to parse internal_transfer (0x178d4519)? There is just binary code in body, so I don't know how it's structured etc.  Alternatively what should I do to have transfer_notification in my transactions? (reply to 92757)

Dinesh: hello everyone. I have a mobile app. which is run by a bot and it has thirdweb connectivity. Opening it in the safari browser clicking on metamask redirects me to metamask.

–∫.: Hello guys, I was studying TON contracts permanent storage and I reached that each contract/actor has a cell as it's storage (but I didn't find any references of it on ton core source code to be honest). Now the question is how does FunC store a hashmap or an array in this given storage exactly?  How does it retrieve it?   Also, are slice and dict the same data structures as array and hashmaps in FunC?

–∫.: Also there are some guides and threads on ton answers and ton research about it, but still there are no exact low-level details of it. They mostly explain how to use them in FunC.

Rodolfo Azevedo: Hey folks, can I send a transfer from a wallet using v4 to a wallet using v3?

Rodolfo Azevedo: btw, Ton blockchain is down? It shows my wallet is active, but when I execute a transfer using JavaScript SDK it says my wallet was not deployed or I get error 500.

Rodolfo Azevedo: Testnet

Rodolfo Azevedo: Ok, the issue was on my side. It's solved. Good night everyone!

jojo: Does anyone have the writeup for the ton blockchain hacking challenge?

Davis: I check code examples in docs and found this code:  if (toncoinAmount.gte(toncoinBalance)) {     console.log('there is not enough Toncoin balance to process the Jetton withdrawal'); }    Why is gte used instead of gt? If they are equal, then the balance should be enough. Why can this be done?  Source: github+toncenter/examples/blob/main/withdrawals-jettons.js#L168-L170

Haint: just a guess, if you use mode pay fee separately from msg value, then you still need some ton in your balance after deducting the amount to pay for transaction fees (reply to 92864)

Asaki: When I use ton/ton client to call the get method of a contract, it occasionally returns a 292 exit code. Does anyone know what this error means?

Rjx: Hey guys, error: [TON_CONNECT_SDK] Bridge reconnecting, 5000ms delay. I am getting this error in my TG bot while using it, This issue does not occur continuously but intermittently. Can someone please assist me with this?

&rey: 1. Check out specific jetton you're listening to, its source code provides TL-B for internal_transfer. 2. Listen to transactions on common wallet, not on jetton wallet (you'll lose ones with zero forward amount) to get transfer_notification. (reply to 92816)

&rey: What do you mean "to check balance"? To do so you don't need any smart contract. (reply to 92877)

&rey: Contract only knows. Maybe it's specified in its code or build artifacts? (reply to 92873)

&rey: I guess because there might be storage fee, which is hard to estimate. (reply to 92864)

Matthew: i see your face (reply to 92891)

MZ: Thanks. What forward_ton_amount means in fact? Does it mean that I send also some TON to a recipent except Jetton tokens?  What is the main utility of forward_ton_amount? (reply to 92916)

Joel Mun: Its used for transfer notification (reply to 92922)

Joel Mun: Its another message that is sent from the message to the jetton recipients wallet

Joel Mun: For example, u might want to notify some other contracts about the jetton transfer

Joel Mun: In that case set forward ton amount and forward ton payload  as needed

MZ: Oh ok. I see. One more question.   @pcrafter said: "Check out specific jetton you're listening to, its source code provides TL-B for internal_transfer."  Here is the source code of the jetton I use to transfer and scan: https://tonscan.org/address/EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs#source  How can I find binary structure of internal_transfer body to know how to parse it? (reply to 92926)

&rey: It wasn't embedded within contract, but here is matching file: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/stablecoin-contract/blob/62f661d79012a259c0110dce611dafc31359be78/contracts/jetton.tlb#L67-L74. (reply to 92927)

MZ: Thanks. Btw. is there minimum TON amount that I should set in forward_ton_amount to get notification? (reply to 92928)

Joel Mun: it really depends on what the transfer notification will do to the contract receiving the msg (reply to 92929)

Alex: Hi everyone. I‚Äôve made a Jetton transfer from address A to address B. I‚Äôm trying to fetch last transfers from the address B and I receive only internal transfer from address C to B (address C has owner as address A). How I can get that owner address?

MZ: Just want to have notification to parse it like in this example: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#how-to-parse-transactions-of-an-account-transfers-jettons-nfts (reply to 92930)

Joel Mun: the jetton wallet test suite has 0.05 as a forward amount for a little payload of 128 bits. https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/21e7844fa6dbed34e0f4c70eb5f0824409640a30/sandbox_tests/JettonWallet.spec.ts#L273 it's a good strategy to adjust the forward amount to see below which amount it throws run out of gas error. (reply to 92933)

&rey: 1 nanoTON is OK if you parse that offchain. (reply to 92933)

&rey: 0.05 TON or like if destination contract parses forward payload onchain but doesn't make further jetton transfers.

Lucas: Ok, well how do you start the auction again for an expired domain, I can't seem to find what should be (and probably) is somewhere here already to find... (reply to 91279)

Lucas: thanks, amount is based on the domain length, right? (reply to 92938)

sangmin: Can you tell me how to decrypt msg in the transaction? plz...

MZ: Here: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#how-to-parse-transactions-of-an-account-transfers-jettons-nfts (reply to 92941)

sangmin: thanks !  Is there only a way to decrypt using tonweb lib? Is there a way to use ton-http-api's API?? (reply to 92942)

User<6034345711>: Hahaha (reply to 92921)

MZ: You can check also this, but I haven't used it: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing#get-incomingoutgoing-transactions (reply to 92943)

Ruslan: With ton-http-api you can only collect data, but you also need to decode it. (reply to 92943)

sangmin: Thank you! I'll check it out. (reply to 92945)

sangmin: I am worried because the message is displayed well in TON transmission using ton-http-api, but the message is not displayed in Jetton transmission. (reply to 92946)

Ruslan: Do you mean a text comment of Jetton transfer? (reply to 92949)

sangmin: yes ! (reply to 92950)

Ruslan: Okay, for this the only way is to decode it using tonweb or any other library (tonsdk, tontools, pytoniq, @ton/ton-core, tonweb)

sangmin: Is there a library available in java as well??

So if I have to check 100 addresses, I have to use 100 requests. Is there any way to check 100 balance of addresses in one request?. Thank bro (reply to 92917)

Nerses: @pcrafter would you please take a look ? I use in my contract fromSlice method.I get in this way message and send it to another party which cant execute it (exit code 130 Invalid incoming message) I think the main problem comes from wrong layout although cant figure out what is wrong.

Er: As you know is there any API to retrieve data from smart contract such as getters or execute msg ? (reply to 92971)

&rey: Getters = https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/run%20method/run_get_method_runGetMethod_post. (reply to 92982)

I'm: Thank bro. It works. I can check TON balance multiple addresses in a request.Hi, may I ask more question.  Can I withdraw TON balance in my jetton wallet? (reply to 92973)

&rey: In common implementations, this is impossible. (reply to 92984)

Er: Oh thanks , whare are the method and the stack referring to in the query parameter ? (reply to 92983)

I'm: Ok bro. Because when I use MyTonWallet app or use testnet to send jetton to other address. It also send around 0.01TON to receiver_jetton_address. It is so wasted money when I send to 100 or more addresses. Thank bro support. (reply to 92986)

Anton: Hi, Could you please help me? I can't parse the payload in onBounce; it fails on owner_address.    var msg = begin_cell()                 .store_uint(0x18, 6)                 .store_slice(tier_address)                 .store_coins(gas::min_tons_for_withdraw)                 .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)                 .store_uint(op::claim, 32)                 .store_uint(query_id, 64)                 .store_slice(owner_address)                 .store_coins(earnedAmount)                 .end_cell();              send_raw_message(msg, 1);  () on_bounce (slice in_msg_body) impure {      in_msg_body~skip_bits(32);        load_data();       int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);       if (op == op::claim) {         int query_id = in_msg_body~load_uint(64);          slice staking_owner = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();         int earnedAmount = in_msg_body~load_coins();          storage::earned += earnedAmount;         save_data();      } However, if I remove owner_address from the payload, everything parses successfully.   If the transaction doesn't fall into onBounce, then both owner_address and earnedAmount are successfully parsed on the receiving contract  if(op == op::claim) {         slice staking_owner = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();         int claim_amount = in_msg_body~load_coins(); }

&rey: Bounced message is cut to 256 bits (+ 32 bits for 0xFFFFFFFF opcode), and even one address usually takes 267. (reply to 92993)

Anton: Thanks a lot (reply to 92995)

&rey: Since staking_owner does not influence your actions, you should swap it with earnedAmount and read latter only.

Er: Only get method are retrievable ? Is it possible to query also execute method from a smart contract ?

Ruslan: Ah, okay. In background ton-http-api sometimes checks whether the node is an archival one or not

Ruslan: If you are able to query data from the ton-http-api, then just ignore these errors.

&rey: Please try searching in this chat. In particular, I've posted the solution. (reply to 93039)

Max: But can it work if all api workers are dead due to this error? (reply to 93059)

Ruslan: No, it can't

Ruslan: How to update the init_block?    Get latest masterchain block with getMasterchainInfo, then use workchain+shard+seqno to getBlockHeader. From block header you need to get new_seqno from "prev_key_block_seqno" field.    After this, put workchain+shard+new_seqno (workchain and shard will be the same) in getBlockHeader. The necessary info is in "result.id" field.    Finally, remove double quotes in shard field. (reply to 93064)

Ruslan: In private/mainnet.json there is a section init_block. Update this section by the instruction above. (reply to 93064)

Nguyen: my balance is 0.24 in Tonkeeper, but it return 241903. How can i get exactly 0.24 (reply to 93071)

Haint: divide it by 1000000000 (10^9) (reply to 93073)

Nguyen: It has to 10^6 @@! (reply to 93074)

Haint: yes depends on the decimals (reply to 93076)

Haint: your jetton master might have 6 decimals, in that case divide by 10^6

Nguyen: thank you sir

Max: Interesting... According to your explanation, the init_block http-api refers to is pruned, but I have both nodes Archival. Maybe during the node deployment "something" went wrong and the ledger got corrupted, idk.  I will be installing a few more fresh nodes, will test it and get back here. (reply to 13508)

Keep: I am looking for a developer to help me create a paid minting process for my NFT collection. This collection will consist of 5,000 identical NFTs (the same image). There needs to be a website where users can connect their wallet and a "mint" button that initiates a transaction for, say, 1 TON per NFT. Once the transaction is completed, the smart contract should create the NFT and send it to the user who paid, while transferring the TON to the owner.  Budget for that up to 400$  Please dm me if you did it before and cab do it.

&rey: 0028 is prefix added by ~dump, indicating ref and bit count ‚Äî you can find that in whitepapers under term "cell descriptors". (reply to 93272)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: I see in the value flow that the network fee = 0.002374097 = 0.002107428 + 0.000266669 (Fwd Fee).  So the 0.002107428 should be equal to action_fees + computation_fees + storage_fees. I try to sum up the three fees above, but the result is different. (reply to 93341)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Is it possible that differnt lite servers report different lt value for a transaction?

&rey: For same hash? Nope. (reply to 93515)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: Yes, it makes sense. I have trouble getting the actual balance of a wallet. I have a withdraw transaction and after a lite server signals it's completion it's not guaranteed that if i request my wallet's balance it's going to be updated with that transaction.  I thought i'd take the lt value of this transaction and then compare it to the lt of the account and only believe it's balance value if it's >= to the lt of the transaction. Does that make sense? (reply to 93516)

–ê–ª–∏–Ω–∞: It didn't work out. I'm still getting balance that is out-of date although withdraw transaction is marked completed.

&rey: Different liteservers might sync at different times, actually.

&rey: You can use pytoniq.LiteClient.raw_get_account_state specifying block where transaction has already been included.

Atharvaü•†: Hey guys, I just wanted a little help from u people I see a lot of DEVs here so I really wanted to ask abt it I'm a 18 years old and I'm soon going to start with my college Very recently crypto has caught my interest and TON has been a major reason for that I'm wishing to learn more and contribute as a DEV in our ecosystem and explore other opportunities in the crypto world I wanted to ask for a pathway to start of with my journey I'm just trying to begin with python can anyone of u help me with ur suggestions? @admin

&rey: You need to handle some message in A. It won't be in same transaction, of course. (reply to 93600)

Ahmed: what Im aiming to do I believe is called multi hop swap (reply to 93606)

Atharvaü•†: I'm sorry mate but was that reply actually meant for me? (reply to 93607)

Anton: Is it possible to make a swap and put the received token into the liquidity pool, in one transaction for the user (so that you do not have to wait and confirm the transaction twice). The problem is that a swap and a message to liquidity pool are sent to the network at the same time, which is why sending for liquidity breaks. Is it possible to somehow "delay" the message, or do you still need a smart contract or two requests to the wallet?

trungnotchung: @pcrafter hi mate, how can i increase gas_limit per tx, i have tried set_gas_limit but it didn't work, now it is only 1.000.000 gas uint per tx

MZ: I decided to use @ton/ton instead on tonweb to use the newest library.  However I see there is a little difference.   When I use the code from the screen it sends 0.03 TON and I don't get back any remaining amount.   Meanwhile when I was using tonweb I was sending 0.03 TON and was getting back something like 0,017043995 TON. At least I seen it in transaction history.  Do I need to set something more in the code? What is the reason I don't get unused fees now? (reply to 93529)

Almatbek: Who needs a developer?

&rey: response_destination: wallet.address (reply to 93614)

&rey: It's impossible to delay the message. (reply to 93610)

&rey: 1M gas is limit for any single transaction. You should split computation into several transactions. (reply to 93612)

MZ: Yeah, but where should I set it? sendTransfer doesn't have such option to set response_destination. (reply to 93618)

trungnotchung: can i increase gas limit for more complex tx (reply to 93620)

&rey: Please look carefully at the code forming body and its comments. (reply to 93622)

&rey: You should split computation into several transactions or ask validators to vote "yea" on gas limit increase. (reply to 93623)

trungnotchung: thank you (reply to 93631)

Anton: So sc is the only variant? (reply to 93619)

wendy: Hello everyone, does anyone know how to send an external message to a TON smart contract using the @ton/ton libraryÔºü

MZ: Thank you. I've found it and set as senderAddress. However, because of some reason it still doesn't work.   Maybe I need to increase forward_ton_amount or something? (reply to 93627)

Alexey: Hi all! Tell me, can you use the SendRemainingValue mod if you need to send several messages in the body of one function?

Nerses: the forward_payload which is aggregated like this    let b_0 = new Builder();   b_0.storeDict(hopChains, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   b_0.storeDict(hopAssets, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   b_0.storeDict(hopAddresses, Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), dictValueParserStringImpl());   let b_1 = new Builder();   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstChain);   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstAsset);   b_1.storeStringRefTail(dstAddress);   let b_2 = new Builder();   b_2.storeStringRefTail(srcAsset);   b_2.storeAddress(srcReceiver);   b_2.storeInt(timelock, 257);   b_2.storeAddress(messenger);   b_2.storeRef(jettonMasterAddress);   b_2.storeRef(jettonWalletCode);   let b_3 = new Builder();   b_3.storeInt(amount, 257);   b_2.storeRef(b_3.endCell());   b_1.storeRef(b_2.endCell());   b_0.storeRef(b_1.endCell());      const forward_payload = beginCell().storeUint(1, 1).storeRef(beginCell().storeUint(1734998782, 32).storeBuilder(b_0).endCell()).endCell();   i get as message field. I have correctly parsed the data of op_code . here is the code          let slice = msg.forward_payload.asCell().beginParse();          let flag = slice.loadUint(1);           let refCell = slice.loadRef();           let refSlice = refCell.beginParse();         let op_code = refSlice.loadUint(32);      could someone give a hint how I can get the data of b_0 ?   @TrueCarry can you have a look at this ?

KingsMan: Hello. I'm trying to write a bot that will inform about the creation of new Jettons on the network. I connected to the LiteServer through pytoniq. I'm downloading transactions from each block. And now my question. How can I recognize that a transaction is a transaction that creates a Jetton? Or where can I find a tutorial that describes the whole process?

Tim: Seems like your refSlice is b0 (reply to 93672)

Nerses: when I use fromSlice passing it as argument it throws cell underflow,while the layout of b_0 is exactly the struct i try to get from b_0. if refSlice is ok do you have any suspicions where the error can be ,as I am sure it is because of fromSlice? (reply to 93676)

Tim: Try one more loadRef from forward payload

Prince: analyze the transaction then you can get easily (reply to 93674)

TON Bounty Bridge: ‚ÄãToken Transfer Failed on TON Blockchain  üè∑ Developer Tool  Summary:I am experiencing an issue when trying to send tokens using the TON blockchain. The transaction fail...  Created by Deepakab56

[+_-]: Hey everyone, hope you're having a great week! I've got a few questions about dictionaries. First off, how can I calculate the storage size of an empty dictionary in a contract to avoid -8 exception? I came across this explanation in the documentation:  An empty hashmap is represented as null by TVM; hence, it is not a cell. To store a dictionary in a cell, you first save one bit (0 for empty, 1 otherwise) and then add a reference if the hashmap is not empty. So, store_maybe_ref and store_dict are interchangeable, and some smart contract authors use load_dict to load a Maybe ^Cell from an incoming message or storage.  From what I understand, this relates to the following TL-B schemes: hme_empty$0 {n:#} {X:Type} = HashmapE n X; hme_root$1 {n:#} {X:Type} root:^(Hashmap n X) = HashmapE n X; But I'm still not entirely clear‚Äîdoes this mean that HashmapE is either null or a reference, so we only count the one bit of the constructor? Or do we also need to account for {n:#}, which would add at least 32 bits?  If anyone here is well-versed in this, I‚Äôd really appreciate a few words of clarification. Thanks in advance!üç™üç™

Leo: {n:#} here is an implicit parameter of this type so it doesn't count into the bits data of the cell HashmapE is always exactly 1 bit in the containing cell and in non-null case it adds a ref to the actual hashmap cell (reply to 93981)

User<69210164>: hello hello everyone!   I have a quick question about TON domains, I hope this specific chat is relevant to ask one: How can you restart auction for an expired domain? The support told me to search here, but all 60 search results are not helpful at all and I can't find any details about it here.  I'm willing to pay $20 with an escrow/middleman for someone who helps me successfully

Nerses: in case my contract gets TokenNotification can i having only that message get the address who triggered his jettonWallet address to do transfer,and all that do on chain ?

Sniper Man: the message itself contains sender, query_id, amount and forward payload packed in a slice, use slice.load to extract each peace information (reply to 94003)

Nerses: is the value of sender  jetton wallet address who did internal token transfer or it is the address who triggered his jetton wallet address ? (reply to 94005)

Sniper Man: it is the address firing the transfer message of the jetton wallet, can be either a user wallet or a contract based on your context

0xbera: Hello!  I am sending 51 transactions between 2 wallets; the sum of their balances before is: 3.1413688669999997 TON; after sending the sum is: 2.64928451 TON. Am I correct to assume that sending these 51 transactions used 0.49208435699999953 in gas/fees (0.009648712882352932 per transaction)?   If so, this is twice as much as I expected üôÅ after each transaction I printed the total fees for it and I see a TON fee of 0.00521599 -- that fee multiplied by 51 would amount to 0.26601549  Can someone explain this difference?

Sniper Man: one possible way is to pack multiple nft transfer messages to a transaction using wallet contract v4, so you can execute multiple transfers with a single sign (reply to 94011)

MM: On wallet, there is no option to send message with transfer opcode (reply to 94016)

MM: You should update the nft_item contract (reply to 94024)

MM: I guess, no (reply to 94026)

MM: Yes (reply to 94029)

MM: You can create a single nft item, or you have to update both collection and item contract (reply to 94031)

Chi: Hello, TON newbie here. I am migrating a Ethereum project to TON, it basically consists of two contracts: A and Oracle B, where B receive regular price info from off-chain and A queries B for latest price info. However EVM supports synchronous call so I can do B(address).queryPrice inside A's code. But in TON's world, that's impossible. So I am thinking if I should combine A and B into one big funC contract so I can access latest Oracle price stored in storage cell, otherwise go with separate contract A.fc and B.fc, reading the price and process the data would be real pain in the ass. What's the best practice here? Please advice

Kenny: Hi! I've heard that in TON, developers can control who pays for the transaction fee, i.e., the message sender or the receiving contract.  I've already known that transaction fee is the sum of the following 5: 1) storage_fees 2) in_fwd_fees 3) computation_fees 4) action_fees 5) out_fwd_fees  Now, I'm wondering who pays the fee under the case of INTERNAL messages. Is my following understanding correct?  The in_fwd_fees doesn't come into play in the case of internal messages. All 3 of the storage_fees, action_fees, out_fwd_fees are paid by the contract. For the computation_fees, if the contract calls accept_message or set_gas_limit functions, then the computation_fees will be completely paid by the contract. Otherwise if the contract doesn't call either of these 2 functions, the message value (toncoins which are attached to the message by the sender) will first be deducted. Only after using up the message value, the contract balance will begin to be deducted.

[+_-]: Hi hereüëÄ I faced with compilation problem and it's still pretty unclear to me, so I've made a research and here is what I found. I'm using global variables in my contract, including a dictionary to make my code more concise. However, I'm encountering this compilation error: [ 1][t 0][2024-08-14 11:02:50.371000][Fift.cpp:67]  top: <continuation 0xb261c8>     level 1: <continuation 0xb1e320> { <continuation 0xb266d0> } <continuation 0xb25b00> **HERE** <continuation 0xb1e508>      level 2: <continuation 0xb1e6a0> 1 31 <continuation 0xb3e698> **HERE** <continuation 0xb21640> <literal of type 4> <continuation 0xb23250> <continuation 0xb1e320> 5 <continuation 0xb1e070> <continuation 0xb41280>      level 3: <text interpreter continuation>  main.fif:365:       GETGLOB:Out of range In message I reply to - there said that it is not possible to use global variables with modifying methods right now, so I changed my code several and tried to get rid of such a places, but nothing has changed, so I'm here to ask for help. Also, I haven't found lots of materials about compilation troubleshooting and so on - so if anyone know couple of nice articles, or something else I may miss, don't be shy to share it; thanks in advance‚òÄÔ∏è (reply to 15435)

Anton: Can you share a minimized example that can still reproduce the same error message? (reply to 94739)

L: No, it is impossible. You need some TON (reply to 94715)

[+_-]: What to you mean by minimized example? I thought that places, where I call modifying methods on global variables produces it, but seems like its not (reply to 94741)

[+_-]: (slice _value, int found) = this::some_dict~dict_delete_get?(ADDRESS_SIZE, pack_address(sender_address)); (reply to 94741)

&rey: Misleading: user by themselves can't, but with Tonkeeper battery they can. (reply to 94742)

[+_-]: But I believe that its is something else, I've been researching on how global variables works and especially GETGLOB opcode related to them: GETGLOB k ( ‚Äì x), returns the k-th global variable for 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 31. Equivalent to PUSH c7; INDEXQ k. But the I have 14 global variables, not 31, so out of range here looks strange (reply to 94739)

Anton: A self-contained FunC file that I can try compiling locally. It does not have to include all your original code, just enough to reproduce your error (reply to 94743)

&rey: You have too much this::... global variables, probably. (reply to 94744)

Max: that bug was fixed long ago as suggested above, you probably have too many global variables (reply to 94739)

[+_-]: But I have never seen about global var limits, how can I found out about this more? (reply to 94749)

[+_-]: I have 21, there are 5 cells also

Sprotoz: What is your game about, Is there a way we can get access to it before the space? (reply to 94806)

Benjamin: It's an online first person shooter where we give a different token every week as a reward for a 3 days tournament. This week we will give TON (which we buy on the market) as a reward and we will brand the game about it with holograms, the starting screen etc.

Benjamin: Since you are a chain involved in the gaming space and especially Telegram games we thought it would be a great chain to showcase to our community

Naman: Hey guys, what is the LiteClient 'console'?

Haint: Hello man, I'm having a problem with upgrading contract  I create a new version of my contract, with an additional global variable in storage. In the upgrade function, first I use set_code, then set_c3 so a method_id function is executed from the new code. Inside that function I set the new variable to a new value, then use set_data to save it. Problem is it keeps throwing exit code 7, and it would not if I comment out the set_data call. What do you think is going wrong? (reply to 94784)

Naman: In the GRAMCOIN howto link  they say " However, before running "pow-miner", you need to know the actual values of "seed" and "complexity" parameters of the chosen "proof-of-work giver" smart contract. This can be done by invoking get-method "get_pow_params" of this smart contract. For instance, if you use giver smart contract [REPLACE_GIVER_ADDRESS], you can simply type:      > runmethod EQDB8Mo9EviBkg_BxfNv6C2LO_foJRXcgEF41pmQvMvnB9Jn get_pow_params  in the LiteClient console and obtain output like: "

Naman: Is it a CLI tool? if so where do I find it? I cant find by googling LiteClient Console.

Development: Hello everyone,  I have been working on a smart contract using FunC for selling tokens. The goal is to accept 0.5 TON and issue 1 "next" token in return. I started by using code from the Disintar sale-dapp repository as a base, but I keep running into several issues during compilation.  Here is a summary of the problems I am facing:  Undefined Function store_data: The compiler throws an error saying that the function store_data is undefined. I have defined it in my contract, but it still isn't recognized during compilation.  Undefined Function msg_sender: Similarly, the function msg_sender is also reported as undefined. I attempted to replace it with get_sender, but the errors persist.  Issues with equal_slice_bits: The compiler also fails when applying the equal_slice_bits function, indicating a type mismatch between the slices I am comparing.

sunyoki: hi

Prince: what is this? (reply to 94996)

Ali: my text get ignore by bot here

Jacob: In my opinion, 'jetton_wallet' : This is the standard and more feature-rich implementation of a Jetton wallet. It supports advanced functionalities such as complex operations, interactions with smart contracts, and potentially more security features.    'jetton_wallet_simple' : As the name suggests, this is a simpler version of the Jetton wallet. It is designed for basic operations, with fewer features and possibly less complexity in terms of code and functionalities. It is typically used for straightforward use cases where advanced features are not necessary.

Ali: i want to know difference between jetton _wallet and jetton_wallet_simple (reply to 94996)

Ali: and wallet_v4r2 (reply to 95006)

Jacob: jetton_wallet_simple is a lighter, more basic implementation compared to the more comprehensive jetton_wallet.

Ali: It is strange why there should be so many different types and not one unified thing like other blockchains (reply to 95005)

Prince: That is ton's attractive, I think

Prince: everything is contract on Ton chain

User<7106205946>: Jettwon wallet is the full contract for managing jettons(TON tokens). And also it supports sending, receiving, burning, and other operations on jettons. At this stage, each jetton type has its own unique jetton wallet contract instance. And then it requires a small amount of TON for deployment and gas fees. (reply to 95006)

User<7106205946>: But in other wise, jetton wallet simple can be called as the  lightweight and simplified version. it supports basic send and receive operations for jettons and the shared contract instance can handle multiple jetton types.

Prince: Rather than asking here, I think you should read whitepaper.

Prince: oops. link is not allowed here?

Prince: docs.ton.org/learn/docs

User<7106205946>: If you need full control and flexibility over jetton management, including advanced functionalities such as burning, allowances, it's good to choose jetton wallet. (reply to 95006)

User<7106205946>: and if you only need the basic send and receive functionality and want to minimize gas fee and deployment complexity, jetton wallet simple will be more suitable. (reply to 95006)

User<7106205946>: anyway, I'm sure that jetton wallet supports the stronger security and other features. (reply to 95006)

Prince: it's really dangerous I think

Dung: hi, Anyone transfer USDT from wallet to wallet using python or JS?

Harry: Hi, may i ask a question?  We generate TON wallet for our users. If the user does not deposit $TON tokens into the wallet for a long time, will the wallet be invalidated on chain due to the lack of $TON tokens to pay for on-chain storage fees, resulting in the wallet being permanently unavailable?

Harry: i just saw the wallet contract 'valid' definition in the doc, so a little confusing

JT: Im not sure my understanding is correct. First, wallet can be inactive. And Owner still can reactivate by attaching an amount of TON to pay storage fee (upto that time) + tx fee (reply to 95055)

JT: As I also read, Validator can free-up the storage data but keeping the hash of last state. So when owner needs to reactivate, must submit its wallet data to verify the ownership

JT: Thats what I understand. Need someone else confirm it

Alfred: I am not quite sure about the detail. But I think it should be external message, which is sent to the contract and the contract pay the gas (reply to 95095)

Alfred: Then I think it can be a master contract there and child contract for each user. You can ask the user to create the signature and then you can use your protocol wallet to send the transaction carrying the signature and required info to the master contract and forward it to the child contract. Verify and execute.

Alfred: If you wanna sponsor the gas, then the transaction has to be created by your wallet, carrying enough data to verify and execute later.

gavin: Hey, this question is a bit difficult to explain. My usage is as follows: I may need to verify the signature of a complex Cell. First, I will use code outside the chain to write a complex Cell to do hash() (in TypeScript, you can directly use the hash method in Celll) and then sign this hash. In the FunC contract, I only need to calculate the hash once for this complex Cell (slice_hash method), and then check_signature is enough. (reply to 95251)

.: Hello, new TON dev here. I‚Äôve been looking at the documentation for a few days and already started to write my own contracts and reviewing contracts available in GitHub.  Although there‚Äôs something that I still don‚Äôt understand and I don‚Äôt know where to search the meaningful documentation for that topic.   I‚Äôve seen this pattern:   ``` begin_cell()         .store_uint(2, 2) ;; addr_std$10     .store_uint(0, 1) ;; anycast:(Maybe Anycast)     .store_uint(0, 8) ;; workchain_id:int8     .store_uint(cell_hash(state_init), 256) ;; address:bits256 .end_cell() ```  From .store_uint(2, 2) what does 2 and 2 mean? How do I know which values to put there?   That snippet comes from the FunC cookbook to calculate the contract address, but I have seen some other contracts where some of those magic numbers are different for a similar purpose. I was expecting more consistency on them but looks like I‚Äôm missing something.  Can somebody direct me to the documentation about it?

User<6984952426>: Hellio, guys.  I want to make TMA game. Right after app is started, I want to verify the user. I already tested get user's info(username, user_id, first_name, last_name).  Additionally, I want to get the information like when the user made their account, and how often they use telegram. Is it possible?

Paul: for your case, this variable can save max 2^2 = 4. and the stored value is 2 (reply to 95271)

.: But how do I know which values to set? It feels arbitrary but I also feel I‚Äôm missing something important.  How do I get to know which values to put there?  ``` () calc_address(cell state_init) {   var future_address = begin_cell()      .store_uint(2, 2) ;; addr_std$10     .store_uint(0, 1) ;; anycast:(Maybe Anycast)     .store_uint(0, 8) ;; workchain_id:int8     .store_uint(cell_hash(state_init), 256) ;; address:bits256     .end_cell(); } ```  This is documented in the cookbook that you can calculate the contract address with that. But why is that different when trying to calculate the contract address for a jetton wallet?   Note both are similar but jetton uses 4, 3 why? (reply to 95275)

Joel: actually just to make it clear. The max is 3 and min is 0 (reply to 95275)

Joel: you need to understand how TL-B schemes work. Basically it describes the structure of any cells. (reply to 95276)

Joel: Here's the definition of addr_std: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/5c392e0f2d946877bb79a09ed35068f7b0bd333a/crypto/block/block.tlb#L105-L108

Joel: addr_std$10 anycast:(Maybe Anycast)     workchain_id:int8 address:bits256  = MsgAddressInt;

Joel: You are basically defining this in cell terms

.: And how do I now that it means (2, 2) and not (4, 3) (reply to 95281)

.: I know workchain_id is always equal to 0, so it will be (0, 8)  And address bits is (cell_hash(init), 256)  But the first argument is what I don‚Äôt understand.

Joel: store_uint(4, 3) = 0b100 store_uint(2, 2).store_uint(0, 1) = 0b100 (reply to 95285)

Joel: it's the same thing. store_uint(4, 3) is a shorter version of store_uint(2, 2).store_uint(0, 1)

Joel: basic binary stuff

Joel: store_uint(2, 2) stores 0b10 store_uint(0, 1) stores 0b0 joined together, it gives 0b100

Joel: how are you defining your provider (reply to 95292)

.: Oh wait, I believe I got it.  So addr_std$10 = 2 binary 10 = 2 that‚Äôs an external address. (2, 2).  While addr_std$11 = 3 binary 11=3 for internal address (4, 3).  Is that right? (reply to 95291)

Resha: new TonConnectUI({ manifestUrl: url here }); (reply to 95295)

Resha: actually with this provider only connector.connectWallet(); is opening the popup, while using TonConnect popup is now shown and modal functions were not working

Joel: no. you are not using addr_std$11. You are using addr_std$10 for both cases. 0b10 is for the constructor prefix code $10 and the last 0b0 is for saying "there is nothing" for anycast:(Maybe Anycast) which is the next element in the TL-B scheme of addr_std$10.

Development: hello,Tell me, is it possible to create a jack token so that the smart contract can be an owner and manage funds from the jack token?

Russia: I want to swap usdt to ton using stonfi's getSwapTonToJettonTxParams function, is it possible? @pcrafter

&rey: You'll probably have to use another function, "jetton to TON". (reply to 95369)

Russia: but i want to swap tether usd to jetton token, i use stonfi library, is that possible.  I want to swap this pair (reply to 95370)

TKAINU: Hello, I created an additional callMinter file to add logic and call JettonMinter functions, but I have to deploy 2 smart contracts, right? Is there a way that I only need to deploy 1 contract to add logic but still ensure jetton_master standard of jetton ko

TKAINU: @pcrafter please help me

&rey: You can change existing files as well. Make sure to comply to TEP-74, that's all. (reply to 95372)

Nerses: Is it possible on the TON blockchain for one wallet to sign a message or transaction, and then have another wallet publish it, similar to how it's done in Ethereum? If so, how would this be implemented?

&rey: No, but w5 allows for equivalent effect. (reply to 95377)

Nerses: is there any docs or material where i can read about it in details. I am mainly interested in similiarities and disimliarites with Ethereum,and how in TON is achieved equivalent effect (reply to 95379)

Russia: but failed (reply to 95370)

&rey: Have you made up your mind on what you want to swap to what? (reply to 95382)

Russia: I am planning to swap Tether usd to ton, I use getSwapTonToJettonTxParams function of stonfi library (reply to 95383)

Russia: const txArgs = {                 offerAmount: toNano("0.5"),                 askJettonAddress:                     "EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs",                 // "EQC47093oX5Xhb0xuk2lCr2RhS8rj-vul61u4W2UH5ORmG_O",                 minAskAmount: toNano("0.1"),                 proxyTon: new pTON.v1(),                 userWalletAddress: wallet.address.toString(),             };

&rey: You know that you need getSwapJettonToTonTxParams, right? (reply to 95384)

Russia: yes i am using that function to swap ton to tether usd of stonfi (reply to 95386)

&rey: Have you read function name carefully? (reply to 95388)

Russia: I have read carefully and tried the functions of stonfi. However, if I have tether usd, I cannot swap, and I can swap all jettons in ton, but if I have tether usd, I cannot, but I want to swap to it, I don't know how to solve it. (reply to 95389)

Ali: How much is the TON fee per transaction?  I paid 1$ for a 7$ swap its super high

Nerses: could you please provide more detailed info or any material ? i have read this blog post but nothing was mentioned about it https://blog.ton.org/introducing-the-w5-smart-wallet-evolving-transactions-on-ton-blockchain (reply to 95379)

&rey: One swap involves around 6-10 transactions. (reply to 95394)

Kapil: Can we store jetton token in the contract

Aldric: of course, you can store the Jetton token code in a contract with the type cell. (reply to 95399)

&rey: Contract can own tokens and transfer the owned ones. (reply to 95399)

Aldric: Are you looking for a contract like factory? one sign transaction, and one publish contract? (reply to 95377)

&rey: Wallet v5 can receive a signed order-to-send-something in an internal message, that is, from another wallet. It still checks owner's signature so this is safe. (reply to 95396)

Nightfall: Hey everybody, do you know why this cell is only 96 bits, it should have been 160 bits (32 op, 64 query, two 32 bit uints)  const rawBody = 'b5ee9c720101020100190001182c8110b5000000000000000001001086c7413600001964'; const cell = Cell.fromBase64(Buffer.from(rawBody, 'hex').toString('base64')); console.log(cell.bits.length);

Kapil: I am creating the staking contract and I want to transfer the token from wallet to stacking contract. I have created a stacking contract I have send the request from the wallet to the jetton wallet contract which is deploying the stacking contract and I have used the dictionary to map the address and the amount of the jetton transferee from the wallet to the stacking contract. Now I am trying to do the transaction there is no exit code error in the transaction but it is showing me the transaction failed . Can anyone help me as soon as possible.

Aldric: because it only query and two 32 bit uints, opcode is not in body (reply to 95404)

Kapil: 00c16b5eb0cab704b978eeb91a0c70c5a30ec559c8ef97e4c2a2fa653038f0dd this is the tnx id (reply to 95406)

Nightfall: but the opcode is in that particular data if you are right then it also should have been 64 + 32 + 32 = 128 bits, but the above code prints 96 bits (reply to 95407)

Nightfall: sorry, my schema was actually incorrect, the cell has another ref that contains 2 uints. But the opcode and query id is in the body (reply to 95410)

Aldric: Do you try to modify contract jetton? (reply to 95406)

Kapil: Yup (reply to 95413)

Kapil: Check the tnx you will understand easily what I have done (reply to 95408)

Nerses: is there any code implementation ? (reply to 95403)

Nerses: i am not familiar with contract factory.I just need one wallet sign a transaction, and another publish it (reply to 95402)

Aldric: first of all, you shouldn't try to modify the contract jetton. You can send jetton to vault. (reply to 95414)

Aldric: You should deploy Staking contract first, and send jetton or TON in staking contract.

Kapil: Can you elaborate it more (reply to 95419)

Nerses: how message signing is handled by wallets in the TON blockchain. Specifically, I'm interested in how this can be done programmatically, ideally with a code example. Additionally, does the process of signing a message depend on the version of the wallet being used?

Joel: Whats ur purpose of doing so? I think it depends on what you are tryna achieve (reply to 95475)

Joel: If you want to respond programmatically on another smart contract, you gotta make use of transfer notification (reply to 95475)

Bojack: It's a wallet that receives user payments (reply to 95482)

Joel: Yeah then you can make use of transfer notification (reply to 95485)

Joel: But you gotta make sure end users pay forward amount and specify forward payload

Vladyslav: Okay, so, I have already started Full Ton node, and it is working, when I execute ‚Äústatus‚Äù via mytonctrl, it says it is synced. I did setup with help of sh scripts provided on the official website.  Now I want to launch opentonapi, so I will be able to interact with the node through http.  From what I understend, the opentonapi needs to connect to liteserver, the opentonapi represented as docker image.  So locally, when I execute lite-client, it is able to conect to the liteserver. But when I start the docker image for the opentonapi I get the error  failed to create liteapi client error all liteservers are unavailable  I suspect that it could be related to the public-key which should be passed to opentonapi. But I am not sure how to get it, the one I am using, is just from "id" field under "liteservers" in the global config. I also have this one liteserver_pub, but not sure how to decode it, it seems to be in binary format.  Could someone please assit me ?

:D: ill let you know if I find the root cause of the problem, will do some debugging soon haha

Aslam: eg: I have connected the wallet now the app needs to route to home  takes some time  also the switching pages in navbar buttons (reply to 96064)

Arjun: Hello frens, can anyone tell me how to get the transaction hash after native TON transfer ?

Arjun: I figured it out. Once the sequenceNo. gets updated, the below code will give the transaction hash. const state = await client.getContractState(address);  const { hash } = state.lastTransaction;

&rey: (You know that an incoming transfer ‚Äî for instance, from scammers ‚Äî might arrive in the same block?) (reply to 96097)

Arjun: That's right. Can you suggest any solution ? (reply to 96104)

&rey: I have written one previously, in a proprietary manner. (reply to 96105)

Arjun: Care to share please ? I am new to TON. Coming from EVM ecosystem.. (reply to 96106)

&rey: I can only share base idea: scanning transactions to find outgoing, then match outgoing transactions to the sent request. (reply to 96110)

Arjun: Got it. But what do you match it against ? The value or recipient can be the same. One thing that can be done is to have a custom message that can be checked (reply to 96111)

&rey: My script treats two requests to send X TON to address A as same and, if executed twice in parallel, will only send once. (reply to 96112)

&rey: (Conversely, for an arbitrary number of different transfers requested in parallel, all of them will eventually be done, each once exactly.)

Arjun: But it can be at different points of time that you send the same value transaction to the same recipient.  How do you check that transaction and get the hash ? (reply to 96114)

&rey: I have to scan all transactions, actually. If at a certain request K there is no overlap with txs from K-1, script loads more txs from past. (reply to 96115)

Aleks: Hey guys. What is the best way of dealing with race conditions on nft items minting? Imagine bulk minting where lots of processes are pulling the nextItemIndex and trying to mint, I assume bunch of such transactions would fail. Anyone has been dealing with that?

&rey: Avoid specifying nextItemIndex in mint message. (reply to 96119)

&rey: After all, those messages will be synchronized (sequentially-consistent) on collection contract.

Aleks: Ah interesting. So the chain would handle batch calls gracefully ü§î What‚Äôs the advantage then of specifying the nextItemIndex in a mint message. I see this practice in bunch of the documentation out there

User<7106205946>: Hi, when you configure the application for the TON chain, you should paste your wallet addresses into the MAINNET_WALLET and TESTNET_WALLET fields.   At this time, you shouldn't paste your private keys in these fields.  You should save the private keys more securely. (reply to 96252)

User<7106205946>: In TON, smart contracts don't inherently know their owner. The stdlib.fc file, which is part of the standard library for TON smart contracts, includes functions like my_address() that return the contract's address, but it doesn't provide a built-in mechanism to retrieve the owner's address.

Thanh: I think we should have this mechanism in smart contract üòÅÔ∏èÔ∏è (reply to 96263)

&rey: You mean, internal message from contract's owner? Better to store address in StateInit before deploying. (reply to 96263)

User<7106205946>: in TON, you can save the owner's address during the initial deployment of a smart contract and use it later to validate incoming external messages. (reply to 96263)

&rey: How do you validate external messages, given they come from outside of blockchain by definition? (reply to 96268)

Thanh: I mean external message, with owner signed, but some condition may has to check the same to internal message also ‚Äú)) (reply to 96266)

User<7106205946>: the each external message may include 256bit signature.  When an external message is received, verify this signature against the sender's public key to ensure authenticity. (reply to 96269)

&rey: The default option is "process messages from owner wallet, authenticate by chain-provided sender address". (reply to 96270)

User<7106205946>: during contract deployment or initialization, we should save the owner's address in persistent storage. and then when an external message is received, we need to use the get_sender_address() function to retrieve the sender's address from the message context. (reply to 96276)

Joel: Is there a strict definition of impure keyword somewhere? I know it means the function is supposed to run some side effects, but it is not clear to me which exact operations would need the impure label.   I've searched on TON docs here: https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/functions#impure-specifier but it only says "we should put impure specifier if the function can modify contract storage, send messages, or throw an exception when some data is invalid and the function is intended to validate this data."  Is this the complete definition of impure? Or is there something else?

Joel: For ex. what about 'reading' from contract storage? (reply to 96360)

&rey: Call to non-impure function can be skipped by compiler if returned value is proved irrelevant to further computation. (reply to 96360)

Joel: Thanks for the answer. But that is not really what I asked. I'm asking which things need to have their enclosing function as an impure function.  In other words, the documentation lists three examples: 1. modify contract storage 2. send message 3. throw an exception Is this everything? (reply to 96363)

&rey: My answer implies: Whatever instructions you don't want to be skipped, you must mark with impure. (reply to 96364)

&rey: Where have you met it? Contracts in general don't need any counters. (reply to 96372)

Mirodil O: from this tutorial. Counter logic Our local storage structure is going to be as following:  * counter_value - integer * sender_address - slice, the address of the wallet that sent increment command most recently In our recv_internal function we suppose that the local storage already has this data stored, so we just read it. We don't need to read the previous most recent sender, because when we save values back to storage - we are already going to use the new value for this - the sender_address of the current message. Once we get the counter value, we want to increment it... (reply to 96375)

Akachi: What do you mean by owner?  Deployer of the contract or the owner of the contract like ERC20? (reply to 96231)

Vincent: no I mean a caller. for example, I want to know if I send 200ton to another user will succeed. if in my wallet there are only 100ton, it will return false and give me some messages. if I have 300ton, it will give me a message of success. (reply to 96384)

MZ: I use code from the screen that I found here: https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-ton-transactions-how-to-track-transaction-results-and-utilize-tonclient-b992336eb3a3  The problem is that boc returned during sending transaction is really long, while the function from the screen returns short hash like: 4fLUfuHzde7xxo2wYwhQV7ZddILIjut9q1V3ZnuiF9I=.

&rey: You need to compare msgCell against boc. The best way is to convert both into hashes, indeed.

&rey: The send will succeed if and only if THE CONTRACT has 200 TON on its balance. (upd: got mixed up in replies) (reply to 96385)

Vincent: yup, this is an example. what I really want to know is can I know the result of the tx without actual execute it? let's take another example, in the code there requires sender = self.master. if the master send the tx, it will simulate true, and let the user know the execution will probably succeed. but if another user also simulates and it will return false, which tell the user it will probably not succeed.

J: I'm trying to better understand the serialization of a raw message. It looks like you can build a raw message to specify a source address, but i am also reading elsewhere that TON will automatically assign the source address to be the true source of the message.   Is this the case? And if so, in what phase does the source address get overwritten? Also, any resources that you can share that may better explain this would be greatly appreciated

/B4ckSl4sh\: As said in docs:  If a message is sent from the smart contract, some of those fields will be rewritten to the correct values. In particular, validator will rewrite bounced, src, ihr_fee, fwd_fee, created_lt and created_at. That means two things: first, another smart-contract during handling message may trust those fields (sender may not forge source address, bounced flag, etc); and second, that during serialization we may put to those fields any valid values (anyway those values will be overwritten).  So incorrect data will re rewritten by the validator when processing your outgoing messages (action phase) (reply to 96544)

Guillaume: Is it possible to get the public key from a private key ?

Alex: Hi everyone. Could anybody help me please?  I have a tonClient, like this  new TonClient({             endpoint: 'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',             apiKey: process.env.TON_API_KEY,         }) But it seems apiKey is not used - I'm getting the 429 (Too many requests).  Also I cannot see the X-API-Key in the request.   How I can pass the api key properly?

Ruslan: Which library do you use? I suppose there should be ‚Äúconfig: {..}‚Äù. Also check if apiKey parameter has a different name. (reply to 96796)

Alex: @ton/ton (reply to 96798)

SACGRO: Make sure this code is not executing multiple times (reply to 96796)

User<6797464936>: plz ensure that the firewall rules are correctly configured. the firewall rules are often processed in order. if a more permissive rule is placed before your blocking rule, it could allow connections that you intended to block. and also recheck the exception rules for the specific ip addresses you have allowed. (reply to 96821)

Luis: Hello, anyone here can explain me how ton‚Äôs storage cost works?

&rey: At each transaction at a contract, some TON (proportional to elapsed time and contract size) are deducted from contract's balance. (reply to 96829)

User<6797464936>: it's determined by several factors related to the smart contracts and the data they store. - the validator collects storage fees from smart contracts. - storage fee is calculated with this. number of cells used by contract total number of bits stored in those ceslls (reply to 96829)

User<6797464936>: storage fee = cell_count*cell_price+bit_price (reply to 96829)

I'm: Hi everyone, I have learn highload wallet and test to use it. I can transfer TON and Jetton to multiple addresses. I want to use highload to get TON and Jetton balance from multiple wallet. But I cannot¬† find and docs which give the example. Currently, I use API from tonapi to get TON balance in multiple addresses (no API for get Jetton balance in multiple address). So if you have funC code and it's example in Js/TS , please share it to me. Thank bro so much.

Joe: I would like to ask a question, how much bandwidth is required to run a ton validator node? I read in the document that it is 1Gbps, but the recommended bandwidth is 10Gbps. ThanksÔºÅ https://docs.ton.org/participate/run-nodes/full-node

Haint: Hey everyone, do you know how tonscan generate this hash for the internal (out) message coming out from a transaction?  I mean the data is not there in the transaction object, how can they link that particular hash with this specific message?

Kenny: Hi guys. I'm wondering if we can generate a safe random number in TON? The developer doc says something about random number generation here https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/random-number-generation . It says it's safer to skip a block (by sending message to master chain) before the random number generation.  But I don't think this is any safer. Since the malicious validator can send an external message earlier, so that when master chain sends back the message to the lottery contract, the transaction is exactly being processed in the validator's block. And the validator could change the block seed as he/she wishes. Is my understanding correct?

Milad: can someone please explain what is Something happened but we don't understand what does it mean  address: https://tonviewer.com/UQCkEQXerZZvw5-7DjKINUhkkgSOJT8Z5opi81W1HtS472eV

Nathan: guys, is it possible to get the transaction data? like the transaction id and hash. good morning

Nathan: how can i do that?

Slava: In my experience it's more like 4-5 seconds.  I haven't heard about any initiatives to decrease this time. Also, I believe this time is very reasonable for most applications.  And if you want quicker transfers you can always use payment channels. (reply to 97025)

Tom - Bushi: is there a function to estimate how much gas has to be sent for the full transaction to complete? along with any TON left for storage fees? preferrably in tact

Fardin: You could do it with TonWeb easily (reply to 96966)

Roland: Great community

Fardin: I'm working on that either buddy The Ton fee calculation isn't like EVM coins  We have several factors may affect on the fee  Storage Fees + Computation Fees + In Forward Fees + Action Fees + Out Forward Fees (reply to 97060)

Tom - Bushi: yeah I get it, just wondering if there is a way to estimate it without having all these hardcoded in a frontend somewhere to know how much should actually be sent.   On the other side of that, how can I tell if a transaction ran out of gas halfway through processing? It cant be as simple as seeing if any gas was returned, since some contract might just not send it back, or one might send some back while a further message failed (reply to 97064)

Fardin: That's right  Maybe we could do a research on the projects like tonkeeper (reply to 97067)

Tom - Bushi: Im still very early on in learning, not sure I could be of any help üòÖ (reply to 97069)

Alex ü¶â: you have an example? i don‚Äôt have any idea of how donit (reply to 97057)

&rey: Hardcoding is easier and produces less load both on frontend and on liteservers/whatever you'd task with estimating fees. (reply to 97067)

&rey: (Estimating fees costs at least those fees, from node owners perspective.)

Fardin: Yep its working for me (reply to 97091)

Big Chiano: bro can you send me some links please? (reply to 97043)

&rey: Well, it returns message hash instead of transaction hash... though explorers might process those in the same way, I guess. (reply to 97092)

[+_-]: Good morning guys; hope everyone having a great day!  I'm running into an issue while deploying a contract‚ÄîI'm getting exit code 7. According to the TVM Exit codes, it means: Type check error. An argument to a primitive is of an incorrect value type. If you encounter this exception in a func contract, it likely indicates a type error in the asm declarations. As far as I understand, this refers to functions that act as wrappers around opcodes. I only have one such function in my contract, and it‚Äôs related to a dictionary: (cell, (slice, int)) ~dict_delete_get?(cell dict, int key_len, slice index) asm(index dict key_len) "DICTDELGET" "NULLSWAPIFNOT"; However, I can't seem to spot any mistakes in it, and all the other asm declarations are from the stablecoin-contract. In the wrapper, I'm defining the type as damnProblematicDict: Maybe<Dictionary<Address, Slice>>, but I don‚Äôt think that's the issue since I'm loading null/1-bit length 0 uint into it during deployment. If anyone has dealt with similar problems or knows how to troubleshoot them in the sandbox with more detailed logs (         blockchain.verbosity = {             print: true,             blockchainLogs: true,             vmLogs: "vm_logs_full",             debugLogs: true,         }; ), I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights ‚òÄÔ∏è

K.: To call a contract method, you don't actually need to use your wallet directly. If you are using Blueprint for writing your contract, just create a Get method function and provide the parameters there. As an example, here's how you can call the get_wallet_address method on the Jetton Minter contract, whilst providing the target wallet address: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/21e7844fa6dbed34e0f4c70eb5f0824409640a30/wrappers/JettonMinter.ts#L134. (Name of the method and the parameter types, of course, depend on your contract.) (reply to 97279)

Jeb: @Durov_Guru Thank you, K. However, I want to call an impure contract method, which requires first sending an external message to my wallet contract. After that, my wallet contract would send an internal message to the target method. I'm currently stuck at the first step; I don't know how to send an external message to my wallet contract using the existing libraries (if there are any available).

As a team dedicated to building and enhancing the TON ecosystem, we‚Äôve found your work highly impressive and aligned with our vision. We would love to discuss a collaboration that could benefit both of our communities.

&rey: 1. What will you do if it is neither? 2. You shall not change accessible functionality of dApp based on that. If person connects v3r2 wallet and pretends to have v4, they have reason to do so. 3. Get address state (from Toncenter, for instance) and match code hash against known ones. (reply to 97311)

&rey: You can write script like this: const endpoint = await getHttpEndpoint(); const tc = new TonClient({endpoint}); const MNEMONIC = ...; const wallet = tc.open(new WalletContractV3R2(...)); const contract = tc.open(YourContract.fromAddress(...)); await contract.sendReport(wallet.sender()); (reply to 97288)

&rey: Yes. (reply to 97324)

&rey: IIRC (more precisely: if TON Connect uses send mode +1) forward fee will be subtracted from sender's balance. It's worth noting that storage fee of destination contract will come from balance of destination contract anyway. (reply to 97345)

&rey: This is jetton: non-native fungible token on TON blockchain. User's balance in each token is stored in a separate contract, called jetton wallet. You may read TON Cookbook for examples of interaction with jetton wallets. (reply to 97347)

&rey: Works for me. Maybe some TMA problem? If so, @devs is appropriate chat. (reply to 97351)

yarik: Hello, does anyone know how to send an NFT via a smart contract? I want to send an NFT to someone else, however sending it requires 1 TON, and sending an NFT through a smart contract only requires 0.5 TON, so for our system doing it through smart contracts is really the best way. How can I do this?

Gereon: Hi Everyone,  I am having some questions about the exact behaviour of set_gas_limit, commit and accept_message for external messages in recv_external. Unfortunately the docs are not super clear and even contradictory at times.   1. What happens if there is a commit before accept_message, and a revert from throw_unless inbetween? 2. Who pays for the gas if set_gas_limit is called and the gas_credit (10k) of external messages is exceeded before accept_message? If it's possible to arbitrarily increase gas limit without paying execution fees, wouldn't that be an issue for TON overall?  The docs state > If gas_credit is reached or computation is finished, and accept_message is not called, the message will be completely discarded (as if it never existed at all). During spending those credit, contract should call accept_message to set_gas_limit indicate that it is ready to pay fees for message processing.  > commit Commits the current state such that the current execution is considered ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù with the saved values even if an exception is thrown later.  Thank you!

MM: Hello, everyoneI'm writing a simple script to send NFT on ton network. It was working well but suddenly the transaction gets failed.There is no error in my code. It works well on the other pc or vps, but only doesn't work on my computer. I tried to run other sample codes but the same error occurs. I think, I can't send any internal message from my computer. Does anyone have the same issue? If so, please help. Thank you

MM: This is my code snippet (reply to 97379)

&rey: It does not. Try decreasing forward amount (preferably to zero) and total amount in the message. (reply to 97360)

&rey: Function doesn't guarantee that, though major wallet apps do best effort to ensure that message is included in blockchain. You have to track... presumably final effects, since that's often what you want to achieve. (reply to 97353)

H: Did you write it's related wrapper for collection contract? (reply to 97393)

yarik: No (reply to 97394)

H: First write the wrapper, i think it's a good approach to use any contract to work with contract, first learn how to write wrapper, then you can use transfer or any functionality related to contract (reply to 97395)

&rey: Please contact authors of indexers, perhaps they could help you. (Also, have you considered SQLite instead of Postgres?)

lw: hi, why the tx  https://tonviewer.com/transaction/73ae9be35218a8bdb452a2849017d08de640f4bf30ed24576b0ae61d3ae029ab  is SUSPICIOUS transaction?

Laisky: After some time of study, in my current understanding, the SendRemainingValue mode is quite risky and must be used with extreme caution. If there are other pieces of code that generate fees during the action phase, using SendRemainingValue could result in the actual fees exceeding the remaining value of the input message. Essentially, this means that the total fees could surpass what the sender has initially paid, ultimately draining the contract's balance.  The core problem is that there appears to be no way to dynamically determine how much money remains in the input value within the current context. The SendRemainingValue captures a static amount at the moment the action phrase is initiated. Therefore, if you forward twice consecutively, you will end up spending double the amount.

User<5657418771>: Hello üëã I run promotions on my YouTube channel at very affordable prices. Interested persons can send a message in private. Thanks.

Nikita: And what a problem? (reply to 97546)

Laisky: When a contract want to sending multiple messages, it struggles to manage its balance effectively. If the sender provides sufficient funds, there will likely be some leftover balance remaining in the contract. If an intermediary contract aims to avoid capturing excess funds, then it cannot send multiple messages.  If a contract intends to forward a message to two or more other contracts upon receiving it, without intercepting any balance, it is impossible to achieve that. (reply to 97549)

Nikita: Yes. You need use remaining balance for another cases. I will explain. (reply to 97550)

Haint: just send an action to reserve the balance of the contract first (reply to 97546)

Laisky: I am working on creating a contract that functions as a SaaS. My goal is for the user (sender) to pay all fees without tapping into the balance of my own contract. While there is a way to accomplish this, it will be somewhat complicated. (reply to 97552)

Haint: you need to have your user to pay the rent fee anyway (reply to 97553)

TKAINU: how to decode Cell using javascript

Nikita: If you want to send a request for a contract, and then send all the remaining money to another contract, then use the transfer of all remaining money with the 64 bit flag  If you want to make several transactions, and then send the remaining balance somewhere, then use the raw_reserve and send last transaction with 128 bit flag (reply to 97550)

Laisky: It isn't the total balance of the contract, but the remaining balance of the input within the current context. It would be ideal if we could dynamically access the remaining amount of context values at any moment. (reply to 97556)

Laisky: Users would certainly prefer to pay a fixed fee instead of having the entire remaining balance deducted as a charge each time. (reply to 97554)

Nikita: I do not undestand you. But if you show me example, I show you how need to do (reply to 97559)

Laisky: My current solution is to send multiple messages through the user's wallet contract when needed. This way, any remaining balance remains with the user, allowing them to withdraw it later. Additionally, my master contract is designed to send only single messages, ensuring that all input values are forwarded without imposing extra fees on the users. (reply to 97553)

Development: How does the Jetton Wallet FunC code calculate the address of the Jeton wallet? Where in the smart contract code is the logic that is responsible for creating and managing the Jeton wallet defined?

Haint: you can certainly send the rent fee to your contract yourself, so users doesn't have to pay rent fees (reply to 97559)

Nikita: Example 1. User send from Wallet to Contract 1 TON 2. You send 2 TON to Contract 3. Contract contain 3 TON. 4. Contract send 1 TON transaction to Contract2 5. Contract spend 0.1 TON fee. 6. Contract lock 1 TON and send all remaining balance (0.9 TON) to user Wallet (reply to 97561)

Nikita: Are there any objections to this decision?

Laisky: Imagine a pub/sub contract scenario where users send messages to a master contract. The master contract publishes these messages using the emit function. Many off-chain workers subscribe to these messages to process them further. Once the messages are emitted, the contract needs to reply to the user with any remaining funds.  The problem is that an emit call also needs fees, while replying to the user will deplete the master contract's balance.  This contract is designed to serve multiple users at the same time. It does not keep an internal ledger for users; rather, it aims for all expenses incurred during each call to be covered by the user's input value. (reply to 97560)

Haint: just measure the emit function gas fees (reply to 97566)

Haint: does that function come from another contract?

Haint: why my messages keep getting deleted?

Haint: I dont understand this. The gas fees for the emit function can certainly come from the msg value the user provided (reply to 97566)

Laisky: If you execute the emit and forward functions at the same time, you'll notice that the total cost exceeds the input value. (reply to 97572)

Nikita: Man show simple example. Look here. Your descriptions are too general. I have no same picture in my head like you. (reply to 97566)

Haint: which mode do you use for the emit function? (reply to 97574)

Haint: you certainly cant use mode 64 for multiple messages

Haint: just use mode 0 for the emit, and hardcoded an exact value

Haint: the last action you can use mode 64 or mode 128

Nikita: It looks like you made some system. Stumbled upon difficulties. And now you share these difficulties with us, instead of asking for a solution.

Haint: if you use mode 128 make sure you reserve enough balance for your contract first, or it will drain all of the contract balance

Laisky: I have recently been learning about tact, and it seems that it doesn't mention that emit can set the mode. (reply to 97576)

Laisky: Please forgive me; I haven't been studying ton for very long. The only way I can find solutions is by sharing my problems. (reply to 97580)

Laisky: If you utilize mode 64 with multiple messages, it may lead to costs exceeding the initial input value. This occurs because the remain value determined by mode 64 is based on the value at the time it enters the action phrase, rather than being a dynamic figure. (reply to 97577)

Nikita: Okay, I read it twice and understood as I suppose  Example 1. Master contract 1 TON 2. User send 2 TON from Wallet to Master 3. You raw_reserve 1 TON on Master contract 4. Master emin message with fixed price 1 TON using 0 mode 5. All remaining balance 0.96 TON send to user Wallet using 128 mode  Result On Master still 1 TON New emited message with 1 TON - fee User Wallet get 0.96 - fee (reply to 97566)

Haint: if you dont want leftovers then just reserve the exact balance your contract needs then send the rest to the user via mode 128 (reply to 97582)

Haint: I said you cant (reply to 97584)

Laisky: yep, my fault (reply to 97587)

Laisky: There are two main concerns. First, using 1 TON for emitting is prohibitively expensive. Second, we cannot use 128 since this master contract is shared by multiple users. (reply to 97585)

Nikita: prohibitively expensive No problem. Calculate what You need  Second, we cannot use 128 since this master contract is shared by multiple users. Why? You can (reply to 97589)

Haint: ton isnt like other blockchains, you have to manage your contract balance so it's sufficient to pay rent fees I know it's tedious but it is what it is just define a appropriate balance that the contract needs for storage (e.g 1 TON) then each user transaction will pay the rent fees if any, the rest you send back as mode 128  if you use ton, stonfi have a good package named funcbox, it has many helper functions to manage the balance

Haint: mode 128 has nothing to do with multiple users (reply to 97589)

Haint: if you properly reserve the balance then it's fine

Laisky: The balance in the contract is used to pay the rent fee. I hope that all the fees incurred by the user are paid using their input value. Using 128 will cause the balance to be misappropriated. (reply to 97590)

Haint: do you know about raw_reserve? (reply to 97594)

Laisky: The issue is not about keeping some money; the fundamental problem is that the balance is my money, not the user's. Users are only allowed to spend the amount of their own input value. (reply to 97595)

Haint: what's stopping you then? (reply to 97597)

Haint: if your contract needs the balance of 1 TON to function, you call raw_reserve(1 ton)

Nikita: Yes. You can reserve some ton on balance. 128 mode spend all ton EXCEPT RESERVED (reply to 97599)

Haint: I dont know why it's so hard to understand. You dont want leftovers, you define how much you want to keep, then send the rest back

Nikita: You can reserve as many tons as you need

Kaviüêæ: like mining app (reply to 97615)

lw: anyone? (reply to 97543)

Laisky: I tried it, but the problem remains unsolved. I still cannot return all the remaining input value to the sender while executing the emit function.  While mode 128 does exclude RESERVED, it does not exclude EMIT. I guess this is because the cost associated with EMIT is calculated during the action phrase stage. Therefore, it seems is impossible to use reserve, mode 128, and EMIT at the same time.  Is there a way to precisely control the fees of EMIT?  I would appreciate your help in identifying the issue with this implementation: (tx: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQD8DNPGNaxU9aGSUxvLbeZSDP5BzAPa0wSVedscrjEj1AHs)  receive(msg: RegisterBot){     let walletInit: StateInit = self.getWalletInit(sender());     let walletAddr: Address = contractAddress(walletInit);      nativeReserve(myBalance() - context().value, ReserveExact);      // emit("hello");  // this line will let the transaction failed      send(SendParameters{             to: walletAddr,             value: ton("0.03"),             bounce: false,             body: SetWalletManifest{                 manifestUrl: msg.manifestUrl             }.toCell(),             code: walletInit.code,             data: walletInit.data         }     );      send(SendParameters{             to: sender(),             value: ton("0.03"),             bounce: false,             body: "hello".asComment(),         }     );      send(SendParameters{             to: sender(),             value: ton("0"),             bounce: false,             mode: SendRemainingBalance,             body: "word".asComment(),         }     ); } (reply to 97600)

In Typescript, I can tranfer jetton with active-wallet, but I stuck when to send jetton coin if it is inactive. Do you have the code that can do that? Thank for your answer.

Pavel: thank you for the suggestion! I'm aware of tonapi, but since it requires an API key and is a paid service, I was wondering if there are any other methods or alternatives to retrieve token holders, or if tonapi is the only option available ? (reply to 97665)

Fong üáªüá≥: Hi everyone, I want to deploy a TON archive node.

Ivan: üëã everyone  I‚Äôve set up a small but useful chat for everyone heading to TON Gateway in Dubai  Join in @tongateway2024  I think it‚Äôll really come alive as the event gets closer! üôÇ

thebatclaudio: Hello! I'm trying to deploy an nft collection on testnet, but on tonscan I see that "Contract Type" is "Unknown". I think that I'm writing the offchain content url in a wrong way, but I don't know how to debug.  So I'm asking: - Do you know how can I debug a deployed contract to read the content? (in this case, I need to check if my content url is the right one) - Do you have any other suggestions to debug deployed contracts?   Thank you!

–ö–æ—Å—Ç—è: What happens if the user bought the nft that is on the pinata, and the one who deposited it stopped paying after some time for the pinata, the one who bought it, the nft disappears? Does the person who bought the nft need to add the cid / link to it to his pinata, so that it would not disappear if such a situation happens?  What happens to the paid pinata account from which you made a deposit if you don't pay for it? Will it be cleared? Or?

&rey: NFT will not disappear anyway but might have its image gone. Or not gone, because indexers have a presumably infinite cache. (reply to 97774)

–ö–æ—Å—Ç—è: Thx

–ö–æ—Å—Ç—è: Or maybe there are some free ways to store a large number?

Nathan: can you get a transaction by id?

Nathan: I was trying to use the lib tonweb, but it's not very useful

C: hello is there anyone know about how getgems or tonviever reading metadata of nft. when i check from contract method get_nft_data individual_content is ipfs link and its true but metadata is unavailable tonviewer and getgems .ƒ∞ couldt understand the logic .And the other question is ton nft concept can i create custom nft collection for example collection will add new nftItem data there will not be user sending the content like on ethereum. if i create custom nft contract how it will seem on tonscan ,tokenviever etc.

Crypto: üëãHello, is there any video or tutorial to help me how I develop mini app on bubble io (no code platform)??? Thx

J: Hello Devs! We are looking to develop on TON, a quick question for now. We need unique user registration filtering process for onboarding on our platform, if we use dApps, user can connect 'n' number of non-custodial wallets which we can not serve. We can not treat every new wallet as a new user. Telegram 'wallet' is interesting, we could work with 'Basic' identification level. How do think we can build on Ton and TMA? We need unique identification number for individual users as well as information of country of origin would help us to deal with regulators. Any suggestions?

Adam: Nop (reply to 97870)

Adam: If you interact with it using ton connect

Adam: It cant steal for you , you still have to approve the transactions on the wallet

Santiago: Thanks.  Ok, so, the only way to lose my funds is with some evil transaction; i.e. when completed, it either steals you or it doesn't, right?  I mean, there isn't anything like in Ethereum with which I could give full access to my tokens to a smart contract forever, right? (reply to 97874)

Adam: Yeah the only way to steal from you (reply to 97876)

Adam: Is to accept that evil transaction yourself.

Santiago: Great.  Thank you. (reply to 97878)

Doug: Somebody know API of back end of firebase of data real time ?

(https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk/issues?q=Decryption+error, chat history in EN and RU chats)  In chat history or issues no one has answered how to solve this, there're only ideas about the domain relationship, but no comments from the developers.

H: Hii , how do I state dictionary in wrapper to be able deploy it ?? And how to i initialize dictionary to fill save_data on deploy?? I tried a lot of possibility but i get exit code 7.

&rey: This is not related to TON and explained in variety of sources. (reply to 98307)

Maple: import { TonWeb, WalletV5 } from 'tonweb';  You can use this module. and also pls create a TonWeb instance and specify the network endpoint. and then create a wallet v5 contract using "WalletV5" class.  why the wallet is detecting v3r1 addresses even when using the v5 contract is that the address generation depends on the wallet contract version used. Each version has a different initial data and code, resulting in different addresses for the same public key. (reply to 98308)

Danil: Hey, guys! I know there is ability to emit events in tact, to parse them offchain.   emit(StakeEvent{amount: ton("0.007")}.toCell());  But how to do similar in func? Thanks!

Rookie: There‚Äôs any plan to support any other language than func for contracts ?

&rey: Actually, the only language contracts support is TVM assembly. FunC is compiled into it. Tact is (via FunC) also compiled into it. Anyone is free to create their own language... although doing optimizations is hard, and studied as a separate field of programming. (reply to 98376)

Rookie: Thnx

&rey: I have also heard of ton-solidity or something like that; it is tuned for another fork of TON but certain features might work here as well.

Rookie: It would be cool to see rust as an option

&rey: Rust exactly won't ever be an option since it heavily refers on pointers, and guess what: TVM does not have any pointers, + all of its types are Copy! (reply to 98381)

&rey: So, &T would need to mean same as T, and &mut T would need to refer to specific place in stack. That already stops you from reimplementing even core, as much as alloc or std.

Rookie: Got it

&rey: Though, I have thought about that idea. 1. FunC's syntax sugar var~change() could be kept instead of mutable references; 2. Lifetimes... lifetimes could refer to validity of values received in messages! Like, contract's jetton wallet address would have lifetime 'forever, while its balance requested in a message would be 'once ‚Äî value which is possibly invalid even at time of arrival.

Suhara: Hello guys, let me ask a little bit, can I do transaction like transfer token, nft using toncenter api? Thanks everyone

User<7207320521>: Hi

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: Yes, you can use the Toncenter API to perform transactions such as transferring tokens and NFTs. The API provides various endpoints that allow you to interact with the TON blockchain, including sending tokens and managing NFTs. You'll need to review the specific API documentation for details on how to make these transactions, including any required parameters and authentication methods. If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific examples feel free to ask! (reply to 98645)

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: The contract suspends the processing of pending messages when there is a large number of internal messages to prevent system overload and ensure stability. By pausing message processing, the system can manage resources more effectively, avoid potential bottlenecks, and maintain a smooth operation. This approach also helps to ensure that messages are processed in a reliable manner without losing important data or causing delays in critical functions. (reply to 98639)

0xtitn: hi guys. who knows tact dex?

Suhara: Hi i need use endpoint sendBoc , right? (reply to 98649)

Suhara: I can't find examples of endpoints, where can I find them? ü•≤

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: Yes, if you need to send a BOC (Binary Obfuscation Code) message, you would typically use the sendBoc endpoint. Make sure to check the documentation for the specific API or service you are using to confirm the endpoint's exact usage, parameters required, and any necessary authentication or headers. (reply to 98651)

w: Where is the specific code for this mechanism (reply to 98649)

Suhara: if i want to send ton or other jetton which endpoint i need to use? do you have demo of it? Thank you (reply to 98654)

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: As for the specific code for this mechanism, it would typically be found in the contract's source code or the implementation of the messaging architecture. You would need to refer to the specific blockchain or smart contract documentation, or review the contract code on a platform like GitHub, to locate the part of the code that handles this suspension logic. If you have the actual contract in question, you may want to look for functions related to message handling or queuing. (reply to 98655)

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: To send TON (The Open Network) or other jettons (tokens on the TON blockchain), you would typically interact with the TON APIs. Below are the general steps and an example of how to send TON or jettons:  ### Step 1: Connect to the TON Network You would need to connect to a node of the TON blockchain. This can be done through a public TON RPC endpoint or by running your own node.  ### Step 2: Prepare the Transaction You'll need to prepare the transaction details such as: - Sender's wallet address - Recipient's wallet address - Amount to send - Optional: Message or other transaction parameters  ### Step 3: Sign the Transaction You need to sign the transaction using the private key of the sender‚Äôs wallet.  ### Step 4: Send the Transaction Submit the signed transaction to the network using a specific endpoint.  ### Example using a hypothetical API endpoint  Here's a pseudo-code example to demonstrate the process:  import requests import json  # Defining constants rpc_endpoint = "https://tonapi.io/v1/transfer"¬† # Example endpoint api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"¬† # Replace with your API key  # Transaction details transaction = { ¬†¬†¬† "to": "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS", ¬†¬†¬† "amount": "10",¬† # Amount to send in TON ¬†¬†¬† "jetton": "JETTON_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",¬† # If sending a jetton }  # Headers including authentication headers = { ¬†¬†¬† "Content-Type": "application/json", ¬†¬†¬† "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}", }  # Sending the transaction response = requests.post(rpc_endpoint, headers=headers, json=transaction)  # Print the response print(response.json())   ### Note: - Replace YOUR_API_KEY, RECIPIENT_ADDRESS, and JETTON_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with actual values. - Ensure that the API endpoint is valid and supports the actions you want to perform. - You might need additional libraries or setup depending on your development environment.  ### Additional Resources For detailed documentation, you would usually check the official TON API documentation or the documentation of the library you are using. If you need more specific demos or examples, please specify the platform or library you're using, and I can help with more targeted information. (reply to 98656)

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: You're right that in a mature public blockchain ecosystem, sending tokens, including native cryptocurrencies like TON or jettons, should be a well-defined and straightforward process. Mature public blockchains typically provide:  1. Well-documented APIs: Clear and comprehensive documentation that makes it easy for developers to understand how to interact with the blockchain.  2. Standardized Protocols: The protocols for token transfers, smart contracts, and other operations are standardized, making it easier for wallets, exchanges, and applications to implement them.  3. Robust Developer Tools: Libraries and SDKs that simplify interactions with the blockchain, enabling developers to focus on building applications rather than dealing with complex low-level details.  4. Testing Environments: Public blockchains often provide testnets where developers can experiment without risking real assets.  5.

w: This is just a large number of users sending transactions on dex, and the number of users is only about a few thousand (reply to 98671)

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: It sounds like you're referring to a scenario where a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the TON blockchain experiences high transaction volumes despite a relatively small user base. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including:  1. High Activity per User: Even with a modest number of users, if each user is actively trading or sending transactions frequently, it can lead to a large total number of transactions.  2. Automated Trading Bots: Many DEXs are targeted by automated trading bots, which can generate a significant number of transactions in a short time. These bots might be programmed to execute trades based on specific strategies, increasing the overall network activity.  3. Liquidity Pool Interactions: Users might frequently add or remove liquidity from pools, perform swaps, or claim rewards, all of which generate multiple transactions.  4. Promotions or Incentives: If the DEX is running promotions or liquidity mining programs, users may be incentivized to transact more often, leading to increased transaction volume.  5. Network Effects: As more users start interacting with a DEX, even a small base of active users can lead to a cascading effect, where more transactions occur due to increased trading activity and interactions.  6. User Interface Design: A user-friendly interface that encourages frequent trading can also contribute to higher transaction volumes.  ### Managing High Transaction Volumes  If you are involved in developing or managing a DEX, you'll want to ensure that your infrastructure can handle high transaction volumes efficiently. Here are some considerations:  - Scalability: Ensure that your backend infrastructure can scale to handle bursts in transaction volume without significant delays or failures.  - User Experience: Optimize the application to provide a smooth experience and minimize transaction times.  - Monitoring and Analytics: Implement monitoring tools to keep track of transaction volumes, network performance, and user behavior. This data can help improve the platform.  - Communication with Users: Keep users informed about possible delays or issues, especially during peak times.  If you have specific questions or need advice on managing a DEX or handling transaction volumes, feel free to ask! (reply to 98672)

w: So how do we know when contract overload is suspended? Can you check it from the node? (reply to 98676)

User<7207320521>: Please I don't understand this app

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: Sure! To find out if a contract overload is suspended, you can check the status of the contract from a node on the TON blockchain. Typically, this involves querying the smart contract using a specific RPC call. Here‚Äôs a general approach to how you might do it:  1. Connect to a Ton Node: Make sure you're connected to a TON node (either your own or a public one).  2. Query the Contract: Use the appropriate RPC method to get the current status of the contract. This could include checking specific variables or states that indicate whether the overload is active or suspended.  3. Look for Indicators: Typically, contracts have certain state variables that can tell you if they are overloaded or suspended. You‚Äôll want to look for flags or error states.  ### Example of How to Query a Contract  Here's a simplified pseudo-code example of how to check the contract status:  import requests  # Your node endpoint node_endpoint = "https://tonapi.io/v1/contract"  # Contract address to check contract_address = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"  # Making a query to get the contract's state response = requests.get(f"{node_endpoint}/{contract_address}")  # Check the response if response.status_code == 200: ¬†¬†¬† contract_state = response.json() ¬†¬†¬† # Assuming the contract state includes an 'overloadStatus' field ¬†¬†¬† overload_status = contract_state.get('overloadStatus') ¬†¬†¬† if overload_status == "suspended": ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print("The contract is suspended due to overload.") ¬†¬†¬† else: ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† print("The contract is active.") else: ¬†¬†¬† print("Failed to fetch the contract status.")   ### Important Notes: - Replace YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS with the actual address of the contract you want to check. - The way you query the contract will depend on the specific node implementation and the API used. - Make sure to handle errors properly in production-level code to deal with network issues or unexpected responses.  If you have access to the node's logs or additional monitoring tools, you might also check there for more detailed information on overloads. If you need further details or examples based on a specific library or framework, feel free to ask! (reply to 98677)

Gold: @malev , would you please tell me how can I get the current block number in the TON smart contract?

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: Be patient the problem will be solved soon   The problem is global and the congestion of servers is due to people's warm welcome to Ton's network and large ecosystem (reply to 98682)

Gold: Would you please tell me how can I get the current block number in the TON smart contract? (reply to 98686)

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: To get the current block number in a TON smart contract, you‚Äôll typically use the built-in functions available in the TON smart contract development framework, such as FunC or Solidity. Here‚Äôs a general approach on how to retrieve the current block number in both FunC (the native language for TON smart contracts) and Solidity (if you are using the TON-compatible version).  ### 1. Using FunC  In FunC, you can access the current block number through the now global variable, which returns the current time in nanoseconds, and then use the internal methods to derive the block information.  Here‚Äôs a basic example:  main() { ¬†¬†¬† // Get the current block number ¬†¬†¬† block_number := slice2int64(get_block_number()); ¬†¬†¬†  ¬†¬†¬† // Continue with your logic ¬†¬†¬† // ... }    ### 2. Using Solidity  If you‚Äôre working with Solidity (which can also be used for TON-compatible contracts), you can use the block.number property, which contains the current block number. However, as of my last knowledge update, Solidity isn't natively supported on TON, so you would typically use a compatible framework.  Here‚Äôs an example in Ethereum-style Solidity:  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;  contract MyContract { ¬†¬†¬†  ¬†¬†¬† function getCurrentBlockNumber() public view returns (uint256) { ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† // Simple method to get the current block number ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return block.number; ¬†¬†¬† } }   ### Deploying and Testing  After you write your smart contract, you can deploy it on the TON blockchain. Once deployed, you can call the method to retrieve the current block number.  ### Accessing from a Node or Client  If you want to get the current block number from outside the smart contract (say from a client application or a script), you would typically query the node using an RPC call. You'd use an endpoint to get the blockchain state, and request the latest block number.  ### Example RPC Call to Get Block Number  Here‚Äôs a pseudo-example of how to do it:  import requests  # Your node endpoint node_endpoint = "https://tonapi.io/v1/getblock"  # Making a query to get the current block response = requests.get(node_endpoint)  # Check the response if response.status_code == 200: ¬†¬†¬† block_data = response.json() ¬†¬†¬† current_block_number = block_data.get('block_id') ¬†¬†¬† print(f"The current block number is: {current_block_number}") else: ¬†¬†¬† print("Failed to fetch the current block number.")   In this case, you would replace node_endpoint with the actual endpoint of your Ton node.  Feel free to reach out if you need additional information or examples! (reply to 98687)

Nerses: I'm working on a smart contract that involves verifying a signed message on-chain. The contract receives a message with several fields, including signature, data, and a few others. The contract first checks the validity of the signature before proceeding with any further logic.  I've implemented the off-chain message signing using ton-crypto and passed the signed message to the contract, but the signature verification fails on-chain. I'm not sure if I'm missing something in the signing process or if there's an issue with how the contract verifies the signature.  Could someone help me figure out what might be going wrong? I've provided the relevant parts of the code in this GitHub Gist. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

Maksim: Hello! Could you please help me in finding an answer? =) I just tried to find any info about the order of internal messages processing.  For example, my external message to highload wallet is first in a block (after shuffling and etc.). Does it mean, that internal message from highload wallet to jetton wallet processed faster than others in the block? In practice I see (in tonviewer), that order of internal message doesn't depend on order or external message.  So the question, what does the internal messages order in a block depend on?  I tried to find the answer in the blockchain code on github, but it's complicated for me. May be you can share some details. Thank you! (reply to 48600)

Andrey: Hello everyone!  A question has arisen regarding the @ton/crypto library When using these two methods on React Native  const mnemonics = await mnemonicNew(24); const isValid = await mnemonicValidate(mnemonic);  Both give the error [TypeError: Cannot read property 'derive' of null]  What could be the problem? Strangely, everything works fine in React Js)

„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§ „Ö§„Ö§„Ö§mamad: The error you're encountering (TypeError: Cannot read property 'derive' of null) when using the @ton/crypto library in React Native can often be attributed to the differences in the JavaScript environment between React Native and web browsers. Here are a few potential issues and solutions to consider:  ### 1. Dependency Issues The @ton/crypto library might depend on certain Node.js built-in modules or browser-specific APIs that are not available in React Native. You could check if @ton/crypto has any dependencies that need to be polyfilled for the React Native environment.  ### 2. Polyfills You may need to manually polyfill certain features. For instance, React Native might be missing some of these modules:  - Install relevant polyfills. You can try using libraries like react-native-crypto:  npm install react-native-crypto   - You may need to add additional polyfills/configurations depending on which specific modules are required by @ton/crypto.  ### 3. React Native Environment Make sure your React Native environment is correctly set up. Some libraries may not work out-of-the-box without proper configuration. Double-check your Metro bundler setup or any other configuration if you are using any special setups.  ### 4. Async Issues Make sure you are handling the asynchronous calls correctly. Since you are using await, ensure that you are in an async function, and consider error handling (try-catch) around your await calls to capture any other potential issues.  ### 5. Library Version Verify the version of the @ton/crypto library you‚Äôre using. Sometimes, libraries have bugs or incompatibilities with certain environments. Check their documentation or GitHub issues to see if there are known issues related to React Native.  ### Example with Catch  Here‚Äôs a sample setup that includes error handling:  import { mnemonicNew, mnemonicValidate } from '@ton/crypto';  const generateAndValidateMnemonic = async () => { ¬† try { ¬†¬†¬† const mnemonics = await mnemonicNew(24); ¬†¬†¬† console.log('Generated mnemonics:', mnemonics);  ¬†¬†¬† const isValid = await mnemonicValidate(mnemonics); ¬†¬†¬† console.log('Are the mnemonics valid?', isValid); ¬†¬†¬†  ¬† } catch (error) { ¬†¬†¬† console.error('Error during mnemonic generation or validation:', error); ¬† } };  // Call the function generateAndValidateMnemonic();   ### Conclusion The exact solution may depend on the specific context of your project and which dependencies you have installed. If the problem persists, consider checking the library's GitHub repository for any open issues or reaching out to the maintainers for assistance. Additionally, you may want to explore other alternatives for mnemonic generation and validation that are known to work with React Native. (reply to 99076)

???: Hello everyone, I need to implement a ton donation button, which is what I actually did using ton-connect-ui, but I encountered some errors, not all wallets can send transactions, for example using the main one, or the tonkeeper wallet simply cancels the transaction after its initialization, if you connect to the tonhub page, then the transaction can be completed, but everything takes a very long time.  What exactly could be the problem?  I also noticed that my site in tonhub is initialized as an extension, although in fact it should be in applications, because it does not depend on tonhub in any way

Greg: any core devs here? could help us debug this ton validator node problem?

User<6753518952>: While PHP excels in web development, it's not well-suited for blockchain or on-chain ecosystems due to performance, concurrency, security, and lack of native blockchain support. This has led to the adoption of other languages better aligned with blockchain needs. (reply to 99259)

I16000: I think you don't need do anything,just validators should (reply to 99291)

User<6753518952>: The 706 error is a contract execution error, often related to gas issues or invalid operations. By examining the transaction details and reviewing the smart contract code, you can usually pinpoint and resolve the cause. If you're consistently encountering this error, revisiting the smart contract's logic or adjusting gas fees may be necessary. (reply to 99283)

Laisky: TON has encountered issues with validator failures in the past, and it appears that many users have reported frequent validator crashes on GitHub issues this year, but no responses received.

Chaincode: Isn't TON a sharded, high-performance blockchain network? Why was it brought down by a DOGS? I lost a lot.

Laisky: IMHO, If there were infinite validators, and each one was infinitely powerful, then TON's performance could also reach infinite strength. However, the reality is that validators have limited performance, and there are bugs in the software. As a result, performance peaks will still exist for a certain period (though this peak is currently the strongest among all chains). (reply to 99308)

Soon Guan: did the master chain block numbers sequence got messed up after the outage?

Soon Guan: context - I'm polling all the raw entities of Ton and indexing it on a db - one of the checks that I perform is  checking whether the masterchain blocks are in sequence (i assumed that they will be continuous)

Haint: you save the old state, execute the transaction, then get the new state and compare with the old state (reply to 99433)

Haint: otherwise you have to have some mechanism inside the contract that signify the result of the operation

Haint: one way is to have the contract returns the exit code to the user as the last message in the chain

Haint: I'm personally doing so

Haint: if the operation fails, I send back the remaining fund and attach an exit code if the operation succeeds, I will emit an event

Nerses: i just cant understand what means compare,as it can change the state but not like i expected,how should i be sure ? (reply to 99436)

Haint: you dont know which state would change if the operation succeeds ? (reply to 99441)

Nerses: Yeah I know (reply to 99442)

Nerses: So I just need to see state changes

Haint: for example sending jettons, you save the recipient's balance before sending the tx

Haint: but it doesn't work if you are trying to build an indexer. If you control the contract, you should use some kind of mechanism to indicate if a particular tx is sucessful or not, like I mentioned above

George: Hello, I encountered a problem today for several times: A create_transfer request was made via toncenter, and everything was ok, no errors, but in fact the transfer itself was not created at all, neither in tonviewer nor in tonscan is it anywhere, not ‚Äúcreated and not completed‚Äù, not ‚Äúcreated and completed with some error‚Äù or something, but in general it is nowhere to be found. Has anyone else come across this?

Testarudo: 5 to 10 secs (reply to 99540)

Testarudo: Is anyone using flutter and dart for the client code of a ton dapp?

&rey: If block utime is larger than valid-until of wallet order, old transaction will not be recorded. (reply to 99539)

Tamagoshi: Hey guys, a question: What is "OBJ" Tag on payload transactions?

Aram: Hey guys I am trying to parse ForwardPayload from token transfer message. and isForwardPayload is false. Do you notice something obviously wrong here?

Leo: this bit indicates whether the forward payload is stored in the same cell or as a ref; not whether or not a forward payload exists (reply to 99558)

–≠–ª—å–¥–∞—Ä: I think isForwardPayload = slice.loadBit() is unnecessary here, isForwardPayload must check if still any data persist in slice and if it persist then it true, else false. but i can mistake (reply to 99558)

Tamagoshi: Anyone can help on this? (reply to 99554)

Tamagoshi: I sent a transaction for my cex with memo and there's a tag "OBJ" on my biggest transaction

Dom: Yo I'm looking for ton developers ... I have some jobs to do, pls send me DM of anyone interested

Aram: still something off, can't get to actual payload

Aram: but for example forward ton amount is correct

Steve: Hi guys. Stupid question: if you get wallet seqNo, then make a transaction (e.g. send another wallet some TON), and then want to immediately make another transactions, you would need the seqno to be incremented by 1, however the getSeqno() method of walletContract still gives the old seqno‚Ä¶  Does that mean you can not send new transactions until previous seqNo has been incremented?

Ryo: I have a question. Only about 190 validators participated in this election, why is that?  https://tonwhales.com/staking/stats

Deny: Yes, you can only wait current seqno incremented to make another transaction (reply to 99583)

George: Thanks a lot, as I understand valid-until is smth from tonconnect, but I searched more info based on your answers and now I realize that in my case seqno that I actually already specify in the message solves the problem, I just need to refactor code a little bit now that I understand the purpose of seqno better. (reply to 99552)

Abdulaziz: how to send like this transaction ?

Steve: thanks for the help! isn‚Äôt this a bit‚Ä¶ weird? let‚Äôs say you are using node.js to send funds to another wallet. if the node.js process dies, then you loose the knowledge of the latest seqNo you sent? so you would have to fetch that from some presistant off-chain storage to understand if you can proceed with new txses‚Ä¶ or am I getting something wrong? (reply to 99590)

dazzler: hi (reply to 99577)

Deny: Check this my question a few months ago https://t.me/tondev_eng/53055 (reply to 99599)

Moein: Hello everyone We have launched a game a month ago and 2 weeks ago we added the feature for users to connect their ton wallet The feature worked until some days ago and it suddenly stopped working We are using ton-connect sdk (vue). The code works fine on other domains and many suggest doing that but I‚Äôm not sure if it has to do anything with domain being faulty but rather maybe it‚Äôs been blocked for some reason? If someone could confirm there is no such a thing as banning the domain we will simply change our domain Thanks

david: Hey, does ton is preferrable than using stars ? cause stars take a lot of fee ?

Jacob: Yes, a domain can be blocked or banned for various reasons, including security concerns, suspicious activities, or violations of service policies by platforms or wallet providers. (reply to 99609)

Moein: Thanks for the answer If it‚Äôs an automated process I believe our domain has been blocked by mistake Can we request a review? (reply to 99612)

Jacob: Security Warnings or Misconfigurations: If the domain has been flagged for security issues (e.g., SSL problems, phishing warnings), it could be blocked by the TON wallet or related services. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Issues: Misconfigured CORS policies on your server can prevent the TON wallet connection from working properly. Domain Reputation or Blacklisting: If the domain is associated with harmful or malicious activities, it might be blacklisted by certain services. API Rate Limits or Restrictions: If the domain exceeds API rate limits or violates terms of use, access may be restricted.

Jacob: If there's no direct banning policy confirmed, it might be best to test with another domain to see if the problem persists. I think so....

Moein: We know with another domain it works fine It‚Äôs just we don‚Äôt see a point in changing if there is a chance that the automated process block our new domain again üò≠

Jacob: Check this.  To prevent future blocks, Check your domain‚Äôs reputation: Ensure it's not flagged or blacklisted. Review CORS and security configurations: Correct any misconfigurations. Monitor traffic and API usage: Avoid triggering rate limits or suspicious patterns. If issues persist without clear reasons, changing domains might be necessary, but maintaining good domain hygiene will reduce the risk of recurrence.

zhuohong: Hi, I have a question about developing a contract. A user sends 1 TON to my contract, but the total value of the TX will be slightly greater, say 1.1 TON, to cover the gas fee. I can‚Äôt determine the actual gas used in advance. If the gas fee ends up being 0.01 TON, how can I return the remaining 0.09 TON to the user?

&rey: send_raw_message(<to user with value 0>, 64) Though if you want message to cover storage fee as well then task is harder. (reply to 99864)

Ho√†ng: Hi . Can i ask a question ? can be a message was sent success but seqno not increase after wait infinity ? How can i catch this issue ?

&rey: Well, external messages (to your wallet) do not have guarantee of delivery.  You should retry sending with the same seqno (once per 10s is fine); when you receive error resulting from invalid seqno, you know that something has been sent. (You may also check whether it was the order you wanted.) (reply to 99879)

Ho√†ng: thanks sir , im writing a script to send TON like this code , but i think if validator miss my message , this loop wait seqno increase will be infinite . Now i just send another same message instead of waiting ?      const walletContract = client.open(wallet);       const seqno = await walletContract.getSeqno();       console.log(seqno);         await walletContract.sendTransfer({           secretKey: key.secretKey,           seqno: seqno,           messages: [             internal({               to: "EQA4V9tF4lY2S_J-sEQR7aUj9IwW-Ou2vJQlCn--2DLOLR5e",               value: "0.09", // 0.05 TON               body: "Hello", // optional comment               bounce: false,             }),           ],         });         let currentSeqno = seqno;         while (currentSeqno == seqno) {           console.log("waiting for transaction to confirm...");           await sleep(1500);           currentSeqno = await walletContract.getSeqno();         }         console.log("transaction confirmed!"); (reply to 99880)

JT: Hey all,  I have a question regarding the Payment Handler. In EVM, one contract can be implemented a logic to handle as Payment Handler: receive a payment, split payment then transfer to multiple accounts. Once success, contract can call another contract to mint the NFT ticket. As I researched, TON has a different mechanism and architecture. Fungible and Non-Fungible Token consists of two contracts: Jetton Minter and Jetton Wallet. In transfer between wallets, identity will be validated by checking original_sender + jetton_wallet_code + jetton_master === sender_address. Therefore, sending a transfer logic from Payment Handler will likely fail.  Please tell me the pattern to achieve the same things as EVM in TON  Many thanks

Haint: you only need a destination wallet address to transfer jettons (reply to 100302)

JT: EVM Payment Handler can resolve split payments, then call to mint NFT in one single call (a.k.a transaction). I just want to know whether I could do the same thing in TON (reply to 100311)

Haint: No, each transfer is a separate transaction (reply to 100314)

Haint: You can have a contract that interact with other contracts but each operation is still a separate transaction. It does not work like any other blockchain.

Alfred: What do you mean by split payments? (reply to 100314)

Alfred: If it's similar to addLiquidity, which the user needs to provide one token and then another, I think it's can be implemented.

JT: Partial failure handling is a problem. I can write script that ask users to sign 3 txs and transfer jetton tokens to 3 destination addresses. Once receiving 3 confirmations, off-chain client can send a transaction to mint NFT. However, how to handle when 2nd/3rd jetton transfers are failed? (reply to 100315)

JT: here's a detail description: (reply to 100317)

Haint: Read stonfi contract. They implement a similar function to add liquidity (user needs to transfer 2 assets in 2 transactions) (reply to 100319)

Alfred: Yeap. Check stonfi, you need to contract to record which is transferred.

JT: It's pretty common to split one payment into multiple destinations in EVM. Buyer purchases the NFT and make a payment. Partial of the payment go straight to the Seller, whereas a fee will be transferred to the Exchange. Once done, NFT can be minted or transferred to Buyer

Haint: You'll have to make sure all the transfers will success before executing on your contract. I admit sometimes it's a difficult problem but there's no other way, since you cant revert the state after you send the jettons (reply to 100323)

Haint: For example in stonfi at the last stage of swapping (transfer the tokens to the user) they just ignore the result of the transfer, because you cant do anything at that point.

Nerses: In my smart contract on the TON blockchain, the protocol requires a user to complete two transactions for successful execution. To streamline the process, I've removed the need for the user to perform the second transaction themselves. Instead, during the first transaction, the user provides their signature, which allows an LP (Liquidity Provider) to execute the second transaction on their behalf.  I need to ensure that during the second transaction, I can verify that the provided signature indeed belongs to the user, using only the information available within the smart contract. Although one approach is to store the user's public key during the first transaction, I would prefer a more secure and efficient method, such as leveraging the TVM instruction ecrecover or other techniques to verify the signature's ownership without explicit key storage. What would be the best approach to achieve this?

Nerses: can you explain why the approach of using signature verification might degrade UX by preventing non-wallet smart contracts from interacting with my system? Specifically, why would only wallet smart contracts be able to send transactions in this context? (reply to 100413)

Champer Wu: the Error message: Cell underflow  would be cuased by loading wrong bit , I think it is your loading code make it error, maybe you could check it first. You can preload it and check the value is expected (reply to 100399)

Champer Wu: The meta data was assembled by collectionContent and item. These two parts are stored in Collection Contract and item contract. Collection contract would store the root path like ipfs://some-hash, and item contract would store the file name item.json. So it would be combined as ipfs://some-hash/item.json You need to check the location of your item.json was uploaded sucessfully to your web storage (reply to 100409)

Sina: is there chat group for Core Developer ? (reply to 100362)

Nerses: smart contract doesnt have private key can it have public key in that case ?

Nerses: as public key is derived from private key (g^priv_key = pub_key)

Champer Wu: the data for deploying would be       const mintParams = {       queryId,       itemOwnerAddress,       itemIndex: parseInt(Item.index),       amount: toNano("0.03"),       commonContentUrl: `item.json`,       authorityAddress,     } as mintParams;      const seqno = await Item.deploy(       wallet,       mintParams,       nftCollectionAddress     );  and individual_content will return the value as item.json it should not be 0 (reply to 100436)

Laisky: Your suggestion is that instead of returning 0, it should return 0.json?   As I understanding, according to the TEP-62, when the collection exists, the format of individual_content is not restricted. The complete metadata URL should be provided by the collection contract's get_nft_content interface.  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#get-methods (reply to 100449)

Champer Wu: As your understanding the url would be provided by collection like    const collectionData = {     ownerAddress: wallet.contract.address,     royaltyPercent: 0.05, // 0.05 = 5%     royaltyAddress: wallet.contract.address,  //sbt-only     nextItemIndex: 1,     collectionContentUrl: `https://cf-ipfs.com/ipfs/${metadataIpfsHash}/collection.json`,     commonContentUrl: `https://cf-ipfs.com/ipfs/${metadataIpfsHash}/`,   };   and the item contract would store the data as       const mintParams = {       queryId,       itemOwnerAddress,       itemIndex: parseInt(index),       amount: toNano("0.03"),       commonContentUrl: `item.json`,       authorityAddress, //sbt-only     } as mintParams;    you can see that the full url was assembled by `collectionData.commonContentUrl`+`mintParams.commonContentUrl` the example will be like https://cf-ipfs.com/ipfs/${metadataIpfsHash}/item.json  the item contract should store the file name on ipfs and collection contract should store the ipfs absolute location and combine two of them together. as https://cf-ipfs.com/ipfs/${metadataIpfsHash}/item.json (reply to 100450)

Laisky: I gave it a try and I don't think that's the issue. The nft_item is now able to return 0.json, but it still cannot read the metadata.  https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQD2IWbvrV9My7oSJ_uGccWA_gY73wSIhcTCuRyMr3GYS-5g?section=method  const result = await masterContract.getGetNftContent(        BigInt("0"),         beginCell().storeStringTail("0.json").endCell()    )     console.log(result.toBoc().toString());     // ÔøΩÔøΩrA2`https://s3.laisky.com/public/nft/ton-demo/0.jsonhÔøΩÔøΩ  I'm sorry, it seems that Telegram has a serious bug that always causes it to lose part of the messages I send. (reply to 100452)

Nerses: can smart contract(not wallet contract) in TON sign transaction as it doesnt have private key ?  and also does it have public key ?

Champer Wu: and the metadata should store the image url  {   "attributes": [     {       "trait_type": "Edition",       "value": ‚Äúhahaha‚Äù     }   ],   "content_url": ‚Äúifps://some‚Äù-hash/cool-duck.png,   "description": ‚Äúduck on the road‚Äú,   "name": ‚Äúhahaha‚Äù duck,   "image": ‚Äúipfs://some-hash/preview.png" } you need to check the meta include image and the path is correct (reply to 100453)

Wilson Gomes: Hey Devs, is it possible to promote audit related stuff here as well?

Laisky: https://s3.laisky.com/public/nft/ton-demo/0.json   The current issue is unable to read the metadata file, rather than the content within it. Furthermore, the content of the metadata seems to be fine. (reply to 100457)

I just need guidance to provide a comprehensive report.  How long do I need to stay connected to the network with my equipment to be recognized as a validator? And can I borrow the entire 300,000 TON? Do I need to have a specific amount of balance?  Thank you.   @pcrafter

&rey: No need to do so in advance (though it's better to run for 12 hours to test if your hardware and network work fine). (reply to 100889)

&rey: Normal nominator contracts require validator to have at least 10'000 TON. I don't remember how they are created ‚Äî presumably in mytonctrl.

User<6912843672>: Hello. I am a web developer . I'd like to share my experience my technical issue and its solution during casino site .

User<6912843672>: During the casino site development, I faced challenges like ensuring a scalable backend, integrating secure payment gateways, and implementing fair play through reliable RNG. The initial backend struggled with high traffic, so I adopted a microservices architecture and load balancing to enhance scalability. For payments, I implemented SSL/TLS encryption and integrated PCI-compliant gateways to handle multiple currencies securely. To ensure fair play, I integrated a certified third-party RNG and added monitoring tools. Additionally, I optimized the user interface for mobile devices using React Native, and ensured compliance with KYC and AML regulations through advanced verification systems.

Jedidiah Chiemerie üå±SEED: Hello everyone. Can someone help me with how to display a connected address after click on the "Connect Wallet" button. I've been testing mine.

researcher: https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/cookbook#how-to-update-the-smart-contract-logic But you should use it very carefully because an incorrect update can cause your contract to brick. The standard approach is to develop a new contract and migrate the tokens. Usually, contracts are quite stable. (reply to 101118)

Cryptskii: Building this on TON anyone that feels they are wanting something like this and can contribute Im just now considering a few co-founders and core team , this will allow ton to have Instant horizontal scalability on private transactions off chain without compromise high, censorship resistance, higher than any other Blockchain can offer that way to my knowledge. The paper is very technical, so be prepared for a bit of a read. Serious inquiries only if you're looking to learn new stuff and push your skills this isn't the project for you I'm sorry to say if you don't already know everything I'm talking about in The proposal to good amount of certainty then of course you're welcome to contribute on the open source code when released but for the key roles I mentioned above you'll need a high degree of understanding and experience with the technologies mentioned: https://ethresear.ch/t/1st-completely-trustless-blockchain-using-pure-math-and-zk-snarks-for-validation-high-censorship-resistance/19756

Cryptskii: Originally when I published this it was anchored to ethereum but obviously I'm posting here because I think ton is the better choice or at least my preference and is where I plan to initially implement this on

researcher: have you read about payment channels in ton? (reply to 101125)

Cryptskii: I have

Cryptskii: This only settles occasionally with a global Merkle root for consistent on chain storage so that should cover anything you were about to warn me about I‚Äôm guessing

Cryptskii: Just thought I‚Äôd say that right away, so would likely just be its own version of payment channels

Gabriel: got a thumbs down, anyone can explain a bit why the seeds would not be compatible? I've seen eth wallets that can take 24 words too, not just 12 words ü§î (reply to 100986)

researcher: I meant most of the things are already there (or will be soon) and you can just build on top it. Like Chain money transfers (5.2.4 https://docs.ton.org/ton.pdf) proof checks can be done by zk (reply to 101129)

Cryptskii: I don't know why it gave me a warning researcher but anyway, I sent you a DM

Cryptskii: The key difference here is that there's no need for global consensus to confirm and process transactions. Unlike traditional consensus methods like POS or POW, this approach is beneficial as it enhances guarantees against gaming and censorship. You don't have to worry about your transaction being censored by specific validators.  This method is simpler than alternatives like homomorphic encryption with blind validators, which adds significant overhead. As a self-taught researcher and coder, I've realized the importance of making connections, so I welcome anyone interested in collaborating.  I'm working on a project that focuses on local verification, maintaining critical functionalities while ensuring privacy, decentralization, and trustlessness. I plan to make the repository public for feedback from interested parties.  At this point, if we can achieve what I propose, I believe it could be a turning point in our efforts to establish this technology as a standard, integrated and shipped by default with hardware devices. This, in my opinion, would define real mass adoption‚Äînot through speculation but through utility. If this technology can perform everything existing solutions do, but better across the board, we will see true integration and acceptance.  In summary, integrating this with Telegram could lead to mass adoption, marking the beginning of the next generation of blockchain technology. Those invested in Layer 2 solutions like rollups might want to reconsider their investments, as this represents a leap forward‚Äîsimilar to moving from VHS to Blu-ray.  Achieving this first will establish a foundational layer for Web3 and likely be integrated into hardware for massive adoption, providing the highest level of censorship resistance. This is why this initiative is so important. Thank you.

Barry.Lee: Anyone who can advise?  1. I recently purchased Dogs Scam. (stored in TON Space) 2. Zeroed out to eliminate dog fraud. (Go to TON Space->Wallet) 3.

Freed: Why do they conflict? (reply to 101159)

&rey: Your story seems confused. In particular, any two tokens on wallet do not interact in any way; even if you transfer A and it turns out to be malicious, it cannot steal funds or token B. (reply to 101159)

Barry.Lee: ton space - This is the swap page.  When the user makes a selection, only one must be selected, but currently both Scam and Real are selected.  Perhaps because of this, a bug occurs on the front end when withdrawing coin.

Barry.Lee: The image doesn't upload.

&rey: You should try another wallet app (from https://ton.org/wallets) at the same mnemonic/contract. (reply to 101163)

Gabriel: thanks for answering! and why would this be a problem if the starting point is the seed? won't ton key derivation always result in the same key1 and eth key derivation always result in key2? is there a danger of losing control of the keys? (reply to 101150)

&rey: Well, not all mnemonics are valid in TON, not all are valid in ETH, and those sets differ. Mnemonics are converted into seeds in different way as well. (reply to 101168)

Gabriel: I see, thank you for clarifying üôå (reply to 101169)

luis: I have a question... after sending a transaction of a jetton coin like USDT and obtaining its hash, how can I verify that the transaction is correct? I‚Äôve noticed that there are transactions that are confirmed, but what actually happens is that the user sends TON and it is returned to them. For example, this transaction: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/1e6fccace09f28735c518536688ad30db87aebfd4b3aa6a4441ce2972700cb9f

D: Who can help me to parse BOC (bag of cell) in Nodejs ?

Geek: The recipient address is not exist (reply to 101258)

Laisky: I can confirm that the issue isn't with get_nft_data. I've tried multiple times; I've tried return only individualContent or the entire metadata URL, and there‚Äôs no difference.  Metadata should be retrieved using the collection's get_nft_content method, and it is not directly related to the nft item's get_nft_data method.  Moreover, The image displaying correctly on Tonscan shows the metadata can be read properly. (reply to 101202)

Vincent: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/b5abfef1d386fbc5306bdc581bc0e4100966ffc2c81dfa1083f143367efd6c69 what does this error possibly be?

Vincent: It shows nothing about the reason of the error

Laisky: I have finally resolved this issue. It turns out that the implementation of nft-template-in-tact was incorrect, and the description of TEP-062 is also lacking important information.  ref: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md#content-representation  TEP-064 actually describes that offchain and onchain metadata have different serialization prefixes. (reply to 100697)

Champer Wu: Good to heard that! So the root cause is collection contract in tact was incorrect right? (reply to 101296)

Laisky: The collection's get_nft_content method should return a uint8 to indicates if metadata is off-chain or on-chain. check the PR for details. (reply to 101299)

Laisky: here is the full code: https://github.com/Laisky/HelloWorld/blob/ac5c067cd6e0a96dfd778f17f214aefe38f4c0e8/blockchain/ton/contracts/nft/contracts/nft.tact#L159-L167 (reply to 101300)

Champer Wu: I was implementing the contract by the getgems example. Accroding to this implementation, the NFT would be deployed sucessfully I‚Äôm als interested in the implementation with tact. Could you share the correct version to me ? ref: https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts/blob/main/packages/contracts/sources/nft-collection.fc (reply to 101300)

Champer Wu: Oh! Thank you , it very useful! (reply to 101301)

Champer Wu: Do you write the collection contract and item contract in the same file?

Laisky: yep  BTW, This is an experimental project‚Äîcorrectness isn't guaranteed, and changes will happen often (reply to 101304)

Champer Wu: In funC, the contract deployment of collection and items would be individual file If the implementation in the same file, the blueprint would output two different hex ? Or I need to divide it by myself? (reply to 101301)

Laisky: All you need is to run:  npm i npx blueprint build npx blueprint run --testnet --tonconnect mint (reply to 101306)

Champer Wu: Okay I would try it, thanks for sharing (reply to 101307)

Cryptskii: 1. Channel Structure:    - Proposed: Unilateral (one-way) channels    - Traditional: Typically bilateral channels    - Advantage: Simplifies state management, enables massive parallel processing  2. Fund Management:    - Proposed: Unified liquidity pool, no fragmentation; 50% spending rule    - Traditional: Fragmented liquidity across individual locked channels    - Advantage: Significantly more efficient use of capital, flexible fund usage  3. Privacy:    - Proposed: zk-SNARKs for all state updates    - Traditional: Often relies on hash-based approaches    - Advantage: Stronger privacy guarantees, complex state transitions provable  4. Scalability Approach:    - Proposed: Hierarchical structure (wallet, intermediate, root contracts), partitioned storage    - Traditional: Typically flat structure, relies on off-chain transactions    - Advantage: More efficient aggregation of transactions, potentially "infinite" scalability  5. On-chain Operations:    - Proposed: Minimized, mainly for periodic state commitments    - Traditional: Required for channel opening/closing, disputes, rebalancing    - Advantage: Reduced blockchain congestion, lower fees  6. Mathematical Foundations:    - Proposed: Balance Consistency Theorem proved by induction    - Traditional: Varies, often not explicitly emphasized    - Advantage: Strong mathematical basis for system integrity  7. Dispute Resolution:    - Proposed: Uses zk-SNARKs, less on-chain data required    - Traditional: Often requires submitting channel states on-chain    - Advantage: More private, potentially more efficient dispute resolution  8. Network Topology:    - Proposed: Flexible, easier multi-hop transactions    - Traditional: Often requires direct channels between parties    - Advantage: More efficient routing, better network liquidity  9. Consensus:    - Proposed: No global consensus needed for transactions    - Traditional: Also typically doesn't require global consensus for each transaction    - Similarity: Both avoid global bottlenecks for individual transactions  10. Implementation Complexity:     - Proposed: More complex due to zk-SNARKs, hierarchical structure     - Traditional: Generally simpler implementation     - Trade-off: Increased complexity for improved features  11. Cryptographic Basis:     - Proposed: Heavy reliance on zk-SNARKs     - Traditional: Often uses simpler cryptographic primitives     - Advantage: Enhanced privacy and expressiveness in state transitions  12. Mass Adoption Potential:     - Proposed: Higher, due to unified liquidity and flexible fund usage     - Traditional: Lower, hindered by fragmented liquidity     - Key factor: Solving "fragmented liquidity" issue  13. User Experience:     - Proposed: Simplified, funds usable across network without pre-locking     - Traditional: Complex, requires active channel management     - Advantage: More intuitive for average users, closer to traditional banking experience  14. Capital Efficiency:     - Proposed: High, funds readily available across the network     - Traditional: Lower, funds siloed in specific channels     - Advantage: Better utilization of user funds, potentially attracting more capital to the system (reply to 101135)

Cryptskii: Privacy:  Proposed System: - Uses zk-SNARKs for all transactions - Transaction details (amount, sender, receiver) are hidden from everyone except the parties involved - Even the network operators can't see transaction details - Provides "selective disclosure" - users can prove specific facts about their financial history without revealing everything  Traditional Banking: - Banks have full visibility of all transactions - Limited privacy from government and other authorized entities - Transaction details often visible to multiple parties in the payment chain  Security:  Proposed System: - Cryptographically secure - relies on mathematical proofs rather than trust - No central point of failure - distributed system - Funds aren't "locked" with specific counterparties, reducing risk - 50% spending rule limits potential losses from compromised accounts  Traditional Banking: - Relies heavily on centralized security measures - Vulnerable to large-scale hacks and insider threats - Often requires trusting multiple intermediaries  Visibility and Control:  Proposed System: - Users have full control and visibility of their funds at all times - Real-time settlement and balance updates - Ability to prove account state without revealing all information - Transparent system rules enforced by code, not policies  Traditional Banking: - Limited visibility into transaction processing - Delays in settlement and balance updates - Opaque system rules and processes - Limited control over how personal financial data is used  Why People Might Say "This Does Everything My Bank Does, But Better":  1. Instant Transactions: No more waiting days for settlements.  2. Enhanced Privacy: Conduct business without exposing financial details.  3. Lower Costs: Reduced overhead could mean lower fees for users.  4. Global Access: Seamless cross-border transactions without extra fees or complications.  5. 24/7 Availability: No bank holidays or off-hours.  6. Self-Custody: Full control over funds without relying on a third party.  7. Programmable Money: Ability to set complex conditions for transactions.  8. Transparency: Clear, immutable record of all activities.  9. Inclusive: Potentially accessible to anyone with a smartphone, regardless of traditional banking status.  10. Future-Proof: Designed to scale with technological advancements.  Nothing is Harder: - Basic transactions are as simple as using a mobile banking app - Complex operations (like multi-party contracts) are possible but optional - User-friendly interfaces can abstract the underlying complexity  By addressing privacy concerns, providing robust security, and offering unprecedented control and visibility, the proposed system indeed has the potential to outperform traditional banking in many aspects. Its design aligns well with growing demands for financial privacy, security, and user empowerment, positioning it as a strong candidate for wide-scale adoption.

Cryptskii: Privacy: - TON Payment Channels:    * Transactions within channels are private between participants   * Channel balances and settlements are visible on-chain   * Less private than proposed system, but more than traditional banking  - Proposed System:   * Uses zk-SNARKs for all transactions, offering stronger privacy   * Even aggregate data is cryptographically obscured  Security: - TON Payment Channels:   * Cryptographically secure within channels   * Funds locked in channels, potentially limiting flexibility   * Relies on on-chain settlements for ultimate security  - Proposed System:   * Cryptographically secure for all transactions   * No fund locking, potentially more flexible and efficient   * Constant off-chain security with periodic on-chain commitments  Visibility and Control: - TON Payment Channels:   * Full visibility within channels   * Limited visibility across the network   * Requires active channel management  - Proposed System:   * Full network-wide visibility while maintaining privacy   * Less user management required due to unified liquidity  Ease of Use: - TON Payment Channels:   * Requires understanding of channel opening, closing, and rebalancing   * May be complex for average users  - Proposed System:   * Aims for user experience similar to traditional banking   * Potentially simpler due to unified liquidity management  Scalability: - TON Payment Channels:   * Good scalability, but limited by channel capacity and network topology   * May require frequent on-chain operations for channel management  - Proposed System:   * Potentially higher scalability due to hierarchical structure   * Fewer on-chain operations required  You're correct to point out that TON payment channels do offer improvements over traditional banking in many of these areas. However, the proposed system aims to take these improvements further, particularly in terms of privacy, liquidity management, and ease of use.   The key differences lie in: 1. The use of zk-SNARKs for enhanced privacy 2. The unified liquidity pool vs. fragmented channel liquidity 3. The hierarchical structure for improved scalability

Cryptskii: As you can see if we were to implement my payment channels on TON or just upgrade it to mine as the new standard, we actually have something now that is practical for mass adoption. Mass adoption only happens when you can replace one with the other well not affecting the user experience and the negative way or sacrificing anything people are used to and would have a problem sacrificing nothing in crypto can actually achieve this yet that is this would be the first time.

Nerses: In my TACT smart contract, I have receivers that accept messages but don't require TON for processing. How should users specify the exact amount of TON to send with the message to avoid the transaction being reverted? Alternatively, should the contract automatically send back any excess TON?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: contracts interact using messages, so typically you define structure of expected message (TL-B) and should not care what contract (not even wallet sometimes) sent it to you. (reply to 101694)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: gasless transactions is a message too (surprise) so it has its own TL-B so you have to read about them to understand how to send/receive them. IIRC, gasless transactions are made by ask some service (tonapi for example) to send your "payload" from their service contract, and you "guarantee" to refund gas they spend for this tx by some other way. for example with "battery" subscription or with additional tokens (you send 101: 100 to destination, 1 to tonapi as gas refund)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: if my opinion is correct, then you can't send gasless transaction from contract, because contracts interact with messages which require gas.  real usage of gasless transaction for users, so they do not required to buy TON for gas to send not/dogs/... - they can "give" same jettons as gas refund to tonapi/other serivce who really pays for gas for their tx (reply to 101696)

Bahar: ‚≠ïÔ∏è‚≠ïÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Hello TON Community,  I‚Äôve successfully installed a TON liteserver node using the MyTonCtrl tool following the official TON documentation <https://docs.ton.org/participate/run-nodes/enable-liteserver-node> and the GitHub repository <https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl>. I also allowed the udp ports of the node after installation.  After completing the installation, I ran the status command to check my node's status. However, the output only displays the <Local validator status> section. The other expected sections, such as <TON network status>, <TON network configuration>, and <TON timestamps>, are missing.  I‚Äôve reviewed the setup process and believe all steps were followed correctly. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Could it be related to configuration files, node synchronization, or something I might have missed during installation? Any advice or troubleshooting steps would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance for your help.

Faheem: GM everyone,  I am Faheem, founder of MEGLAND. We are in the middle of developing our mini-app MEGBattle, as well as the overall MEGLAND project, and we are looking for a motivated developer to join our team.  I want to be transparent: there is no immediate compensation in stablecoins. What we are offering is a unique opportunity to join a growing project, with percentages of tokens allocated under a vesting plan. This structure is designed to align the interests of our team over the long term, by rewarding commitment and contribution to the success of MEGLAND.  We are not just looking for a developer, but a true member of our core team, someone who shares our vision and is willing to invest with us until the launch of our token. This launch has been awaited by our community for four years, and we are finally getting closer to this crucial moment.  MEGLAND is currently based at Station F, where we were selected in the most selective batch in their history. We are also members of the TON Nest group level 2, and we are preparing to join level 3. We are at a key moment in our adventure, and this is an opportunity for someone to join us to be part of this story.  If you are interested or know someone who might be, I would be happy to discuss it in more detail. We are based in Paris, so if you speak both French and English, it would be ideal to ensure smooth communication within the team.  Thank you all and see you soon!

Mr Shelby: Does anyone here know how to transfer Jetton tokens to another wallet using React Native?

Gigen: Excuse me, I enabled web H5 in TG. When the user clicks to connect to the wallet, my original screen will be closed and the wallet will be opened. I hope not to close the original screen.

Maiwand: What should i do

Tiqan: How do i tell tonviewer what the contract type is?

‚Äî 2024-09-06 ‚Äî

Soon Guan: given that ton is async, how long can it be before a transfers triggers an internal transfers (e.g. for a simple transfer of jetton token on the network?)

Soon Guan: similarly, does a transfers needs to be "ack" within N hours before it is dropped?

JT: Let's break it down the procedures. Unlike Ethereum, transactions, in TON, are called message. When you interact with TON, you basically send external_message to your Jetton Wallet then it triggers the internal_message

SH: then how do i know which transactions are connected and they are all confirmed? (reply to 102482)

JT: Contract -> contract: internal_message. Once is sent, your contract respond to you what if an error occurs. However, the outcome of the internal_message won't be guaranteed (reply to 102483)

Haint: there's a validUntil config when sending transaction. As for messages initiated from a contract I dont think there's a time constraint, but they will eventually be included (reply to 102481)

SH: so even if it's a internal transaction between another contracts, it will notice back to me. did i understand correctly? (reply to 102484)

Soon Guan: oh my gosh - so the upper limit seems to be... limitless? (reply to 102485)

JT: I can give you an example as follows: - User A makes a payment to User B - User B receives a payment and update balance, then make transfer_notification to Notification (custom) contract that would issue a receipt - Assuming there might be some errors that Notification handles the transfer_notification op and revert, outcome on User won't be reverted

Haint: looks like it, the tvm guarantees all internal messages from contract to be delivered but I dont think they make any promise on how long it will take (reply to 102487)

SH: ah gotchu thanks

JT: true. It takes from 0 -> infinity. No guarantee (reply to 102489)

JT: you won't achieve what so call atomicity in TON, so must have a proper design or solution, and also be aware and well-prepare for possible failures (including partial ones)

Soon Guan: i see, this is helpful thanks! and everyone who replied (reply to 102489)

dann: hi, is there a way for me to get 1000 TON testnet tokens?

Haint: yes you can get 5 TON every 1 hour, so it will take 200 hours to get 1000 TON (reply to 102496)

dann: is there another way or someone i can contact to purchase / get 1000 testnet TON straight? we are running an app on TON and need a ton of gas üòÖ (reply to 102497)

Haint: why do you possibly need 1000 TON for gas? it's dirt cheap (reply to 102499)

kj: hi

Leo: the left side of the equation you wrote is just the hex representation of cell data while the right side is (hex repr + length), which contains more information than left side so they are not equal - e.g. [0x8_] maybe the hex repr of 1[8_], 2[8_], 3[8_], 4[8_] (reply to 102507)

Lee: I initiated a transaction and used the API to query it, but the API only returned the final message (D). Can someone tell me how to retrieve the previous messages A, B, and C? The transaction ID is 5aa36f8db0b509a01e2111c760912d393f5e97af35838b26c474b61ca3bc60eb.

Daniel: hey guys how do you emit events on func just like on solidity

Laisky: Use trace api (reply to 102515)

&rey: The next question will be "how to get emitted events", right? Just skip both of those and track transactions on your contract. (reply to 102518)

Daniel: Just skip both of those and track transactions on your contract.  do you mind expanding on this? (reply to 102520)

Lee: What is  trace API? Is it a specific API from a node? (reply to 102519)

Soon Guan: are all hex addresses on Ton len 66? (e.g. `0:EE87D1CDA0977F041950A6905774908C49C5E1FF78CAEE8D5E0C09441444A777`)

&rey: Repeatedly poll, or subscribe to, transactions on your contract (each transaction corresponds to one internal message). Then you can check exit code and message data. (reply to 102521)

Daniel: so there‚Äôs no way to do this? (reply to 102518)

&rey: There is but external-out/log/emitted messages are useless. (reply to 102527)

Soon Guan: @pcrafter thanks! - i'm trying to figure out the jetton masters in all transfer messages - i noticed that the messages don't include the jetton masters and Im using initstates to figure out (which has owner, jetton master and the jetton address) (reply to 102524)

Carterüßπ: I'm looking to get the actual wallet code to compare Jetton Wallet Code across many Jettons.  I can pull the Cell from get_jetton_data, and I assumed it would just  be a long string of cells containing data bytes. It looks like this is not the case.

–ê–º–∏—Ä: Only if you implement specific functionality with message signing as in general ton wallet (reply to 102617)

&rey: Wallet doesn't solve zero-fees problem for you; it is also by far not the best choice for users. (reply to 102615)

&rey: You should consider payment channels... ah, those are not available in most wallet apps, sorry.

Ayor: Ok sad, I was very hyped by this.  I have to wait a L2 on TON (reply to 102619)

Ayor: Thanks !

&rey: To send an internal message to jetton wallet, you need something converting external=>internal. Wallet contract is exactly that. (reply to 102624)

&rey: You can choose such wallets that they are in same shard as specific jetton's wallets. That's (now) 4 bits of unlikelihood per jetton. (reply to 102626)

&rey: Shards are deterministic and may only split or merge at predefined points. While max split depth is 4, then all workchain accounts with same 4-bit prefix of hash part will always be in the same shard. (reply to 102630)

–ê–º–∏—Ä: You can implement same logic as in v4r2 with external msg processing (reply to 102624)

&rey: Yes. If you decode base64, first two bytes are tag and workchain, and the third byte starts hash part. (reply to 102634)

User<5762094943>: so let me know if that possible

So I sent 59 TON but as soon as I did smn took and sent the money to another account from this wallet; meaning he has acccess to it. And I checked the history of the wallet and the history isn't mine as well; I have used this Ton Space on this account but now history is completely different and smb has access to it. In the end I lost 59 TON. Anyone can explain how could thing like this happen?

[+_-]: Hey everyone, happy Saturday!  I've been running a sandbox with a mainnet mock, and it's performing terribly: only about one in ten runs succeeds, with most failing due to timeouts (despite increasing all timeout limits, including for requests) or throwing random errors that disappear on the next iteration. I've tried both the tonhubapi link and getHttpV4Endpoint({ network: "mainnet" }). If anyone has extensive experience with the mainnet-sandbox, I'd really appreciate any tips on how to improve this situation. Thanks!

Alex: Hi guys, do you know the best way to find a transaction by transaction hash?

Alex: Ok, could you give me some advice please‚Ä¶ I use the ton connect library for the frontend. The result of send transaction method is BOC. I managed to convert this boc to hash, but I don‚Äôt understand how to find this transaction on the backend side, because there‚Äôs no such method in toncenter‚Ä¶ (reply to 102836)

Alex: Is there a way to take the transaction address from that BOC? (reply to 102836)

&rey: Btw that hash is not transaction hash, and it doesn't guarantee transaction being recorded. (reply to 102837)

Alex: Ok, what do I need to do with this kind of result? How I can use it to identify the transfer or some transfer details? (reply to 102845)

&rey: wait, transfer details? You have sent the transfer via TON Connect so you probably should already have full order? (reply to 102846)

Alex: I mean any useful data. I have order details, but I don‚Äôt have any blockchain info: address, hash, etc (reply to 102847)

&rey: Address? You have both source one (user's) and destination (in order). Hash? You have to listen to blockchain, yeah, because TC2 response doesn't guarantee it. (reply to 102848)

Alex: Transaction address‚Ä¶. Ok, now I‚Äôm lost. Could you explain please what‚Äôs the answer from the ton connect‚Äôs response. It is a BOC which represents what? (reply to 102849)

&rey: That BOC = serialized external message to user's wallet. (reply to 102850)

thebatclaudio: Hello! Can I create an NFT collection and allow other users to Mint NFT?

&rey: Yes, but it's nontrivial. Please try searching.

Alex: Thank you. What is surprising, that I‚Äôve converted that BOC to hash and I am able to search by this hash in ton scan, so I was thinking that I actually can use this hash to find the transaction in blockchain. Do you know a possible way to do so? (reply to 102854)

&rey: Explorers are quite smart so they can look up message hashes as well. (reply to 102859)

Rudolf: Hi guys, do someone know how to get the contract type (interface, like it shows tonviewer), but without using tonapi or some other api service. Thank you

&rey: Well, you need something classifying contract by their code or code cell hash. Also, you need to load contract state somehow; I assume you can do so through liteservers, which are not API. (reply to 102868)

LucifetüçÖ: Why not when you got stolen and you know where address of the scamer is (reply to 102883)

&rey: I acknowledge; blockchain by design is IMMUTABLE storage of transaction.

&rey: (You have better chance to convince scammer to return money than doing something onchain.)

LucifetüçÖ: And why then ton support just contact me now

&rey: More scam? Watch out, they'll say "just send a bit more money". (reply to 102903)

&rey: Blockchain is an automatic system. Can you prove to computer that you intended to do something? You can't, so it won't be possible to pull money out.  After all, from chain perspective the situation is equivalent to you being a scammer, sending a payment for something and revoking it afterwards. (reply to 102885)

I receive internal msg with struct Item: struct Item {     prop1: String;     prop2: String;     prop3: String;     prop4: String; } and I wanna save its hash with price in a small map like a catalog. If I use  sha256(msg.item.toCell().asSlice())  it returns the same hash for all incoming items (probably because it hashes only ref cell). So what is be the best approach of hasing a stuct with string fields (taking into account, that sha256 is relatively havy hash func and I can stand with lighter hashing)?

Mahdi: You don't have problem like this?  where is your server? (reply to 103077)

31dzairy: Help Needed with Stolen Assets Stored on Username NFTs  Hello team,  I‚Äôve lost over $20,000 in assets through an exploit, and I‚Äôve traced them to a DNS associated with a username on the TON blockchain. The scammers used the Fragment platform and stole my anonymous "888" blockchain numbers. I‚Äôve uncovered disturbing details about the accounts involved, including strange usernames and likely photos of one of the individuals.  Who is responsible for handling cases of stolen assets being stored on username domains, and can anyone assist with tracking or recovering them?  Thank you

&rey: No one can move assets on blockchain back. (reply to 103094)

31dzairy: i klicked something wrong. but anyway is there a way to freeze stolen assets

JC: I may have missed the method mentioned in the document, but I really didn't find the best practice. .

JC: Because I found that the send method has no return value (I think this may be due to asynchronous reasons), but usually a send method will generate multiple transactions (such as Jetton transfers). I hope to get whether a specific call (such as Jetton notification) is successful. Is there any good way? (reply to 103102)

C.: Every address is created in deterministic fashion so you don't have to hold information regarding to child addresses. If you want to query the jetton wallet address of a EOA you just send a get query to the minter contract and it will return you the jetton wallet address.   https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-minter-discoverable.fc  In this implementation at line 147 it shows the reference implementation of the get query for example.

Atsushi: About a week ago, I developed a Telegram mini app game and submitted a review request to have it listed on the "TON App" site, but it was rejected. However, I have no idea why it was rejected. When I contacted support, they only replied with "Reviews have been published," and I couldn't figure out where to check the details. Has anyone experienced something similar and managed to resolve it? If so, could you please share how you resolved it? (reply to 103190)

Justin1: Hi, is it possible to calculate the exact gas consumption when contract handle a message?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: https://minter.ton.org/?testnet=true (reply to 103197)

&rey: To answer that, you need to ask "who will provide value, if any" first. That implies that one of these must happen: ‚Äî someone must buy out those NFTs at no profit to themselves, ‚Äî someone must add utility like access to a closed community, ‚Äî someone must reward NFT holders.

Kapil: Can we store tuple on the blockchain

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: yes and no. You need to "serialize" it to cell manually, you can do it by storing members "one-by-one" only. Later you'll read them back (from slice), one-by-one again (reply to 103252)

Atsushi: Hello! We also provided all the necessary information, but our listing on TON App was rejected. We contacted support as well, but the only reply we received was "Reviews have been published." We responded with "I'm sorry, but I'm not sure where I can find the published review. Could you please let me know where I can check it?" and sent several follow-up messages, but we haven‚Äôt received any further replies from support, which is quite frustrating. Have you had any progress on your side? (reply to 100049)

Josh: Anybody know where/how I can download transactions data of a ton wallet to a csv? I don't see an option on Tonscan or Tonviewer

unreadyplayer: Nope. Last 'feedback' we received was that our app looked unfinished, even though it is.   Very broken process and I guess it comes down to the whim of whoever is looking over the application at that time. (reply to 103265)

Vgo: Thank you so much! i am going to try it (reply to 103152)

Atsushi: Thank you for sharing that.  Based on that feedback, it seems like the review criteria might be whether the features expected by TON App are implemented. ü§î That being said, I can only hope they tell us what exactly looks unfinished...  > Very broken process and I guess it comes down to the whim of whoever is looking over the application at that time. I completely agree. Haha. (reply to 103269)

the_renovatio: hey, is there a way that a transaction is 100% deployed to the blockchain? right now i am using tonapi to send the boc, but sometimes the transaction does not change the seqno of the wallet, so transaction is not processed by validators. do you know a solution?

Carterüßπ: liteServer.getAccountState is giving me back pruned state, starting with a merkle proof.  How can I get it to give me the complete state for the account? I want to get the code for the account.

Carterüßπ: Maybe it's my deserialization, though I thought I would have found all bugs in this as I can deserialize full Block structures

Steve: hi. does anybody have experience with dedust SDK?  i am looking at their docs to swap jettons to TON, but it doesn‚Äôt make much sense tbh: https://docs.dedust.io/docs/swaps

NPA120: You can use this link:https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#how-to-send-a-swap-message-to-dex-dedust (reply to 103397)

Steve: To swap TON to JETTON, sendSwap method is used of tonVault.  However, when I am following the docs to swap JETTON to TON, scaleWallet.sendTransfer is used.  When I look at the typescript code, ‚Äì const scaleWallet = tonClient.open(await scaleRoot.getWallet(sender.address); ‚Äì scaleWallet does not have .sendTransfer method‚Ä¶  Maybe I am missing something‚Ä¶  Also can‚Äôt find from the docs what sendTransfer ultimately is:   await scaleWallet.sendTransfer(sender, toNano("0.3"), {   amount: amountIn,   destination: scaleVault.address,   responseAddress: sender.address, // return gas to user   forwardAmount: toNano("0.25"),   forwardPayload: VaultJetton.createSwapPayload({ poolAddress }), });   for example, what is the second argument of toNano(‚Äú0.3) ?

Shapeshift77: Along with coding we need to learn how to stop the fake opportunities

&rey: That's... an architecture question with an easy answer: you probably need a backend. Btw quickly-changing items also require backend. (reply to 103733)

Gleb: You mean a simple web 2.0 backend? And using ton only for  payments? (reply to 103736)

&rey: Exactly that. Backend might sign data with Ed25519 keys for some validation in contracts, if needed. (reply to 103738)

Gleb: Make sense. Another question than. Is it possible to call backend from contract to get data? Or send data from contract to backend? (reply to 103739)

&rey: It's only possible from backend side to poll whatever happens with contract. (reply to 103740)

Laisky: I have a thought that I‚Äôm uncertain about: the TON protocol does not have built-in defenses against message replay attacks. This means that an attacker could replay historical messages, and contracts must implement their own defense against replay attacks using a nonce. Is that correct?

Laisky: I found this in the white paper that suggests only external messages need to consider replay attacks. (reply to 103798)

Kapil: I know that but I am asking who I can Store the data without getting this error (reply to 103806)

Daniel: You are writing a lot of data in one cell. The possible solution is to put some data in new cells and store as a ref. If 4 refs is not enough, then to create refs in refs. (reply to 103807)

Nam: hi, does anyone know how to get Status success or failed of a transaction?

‚òÄÔ∏èüêñüèéü•îüç∑üç∫„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§„Ö§: Question: we have a couple of devs, but they're not really familiar with TON or the blockchain. Does anyone want to join our project to build a game? The concept is quite mature, and we have most documentation necessary to put it together. We are currently volunteering together to launch something big that we hope can pay off well. It's a very big project, but the work isn't that much! Or does anyone know anyone who would be interested? Either send me a DM or respond to my message please :)

Nam: for example I have a transaction on testnet tonviewer adjacentTransactions

Nam: it always return success, I cannot distinguish when i really success or it failed

Nam: how about if i'm checking using api of tonviewer? For now i'm using api/v3/adjacentTransactions, the "aborted" is the same as "aborted": false in API?

Giessen: is there anyone can tell me how the metadata of ton dns nft is embeded

Kapil: Is there any limit of storing the data in the dictionary

Champer Wu: check the exit code and align the detail from  https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-exit-codes (reply to 103877)

Champer Wu: furthermore, you can check the hex on this file https://gist.github.com/a2468834/323f0be6ad029a503cad1a24d598fd09

Nam: yes, I tried get transaction detail using toncenter, unfortunately it always tell me aborted : false even when my transaction is success (reply to 103879)

Kapil: Upto much data we can Store (reply to 103881)

Kapil: Okk (reply to 103889)

Nam: yes, I understand this point, I mean there is no field show me if transaction is success or failed using toncenter API  Here is the example: 1. Success transaction: testnet.toncenter com/api/v3/adjacentTransactions?hash=2112af068e87cea371b0d89b8a7ef58e9c80a0da060332653c3954115496ba40  2, Failed transaction:  testnet.toncenter com/api/v3/adjacentTransactions?hash=4c5d1a62df97c4afb754b1356259c14b1caf8c0ab7039f8dfdea6fd955ebd932  Sorry for the inconvenience, I cannot directly insert a link (reply to 103887)

Nam: but it shows me "failed" like this image üòÇ (reply to 103872)

Nam: > the "4c...932" transaction is not aborted (it's A in the tonviewer message flow chart) and the aborted tx is C  so when the tx C is aborted, my transaction is Failed in overall?

C.: Does anyone know why Adress.parse fails on pTon contract

Nam: I understand, thank you for your explanation and suggestion ‚ù§Ô∏è (reply to 103901)

Nam: just one more question in my particular example. If both transaction I provided here are successful, Is there any way to distinguish when it is "Failed transaction" or "Confirmed transaction"? (reply to 103872)

Max: Hello, guys!  Any plans to continue updating https://archival-dump.ton.org/ ?

Cat: Hi! Could you please tell me how transactions sent from a contract are executed? Is there any queue in which they are placed in the order of sending? I've read about lt, but in practice I don't fully understand how it works. I have a contract that sends money to several people in a cycle and then sends the balance to another contract. And it seems to me that these transactions are not quite sequential, because I get error code 37 (Not enough TON). There should definitely be enough money on the contract. This is how I send the last transaction. How can I be sure that myBalance() here returns the final balance after all the previous transactions?  send(SendParameters{     to: self.parent,     bounce: true,     value: max(0, myBalance() - context().value - self.MinTonForFees),     mode: SendRemainingValue });

&rey: Sending is sequential, and your code is incorrect. See: value, mode. (reply to 103965)

Cat: Got it, thank you very much (reply to 103966)

Buggy: Yes, it's what I'm doing right now and the problem is it's really slow because it has to wait for tx confirmed.  Or do you mean grouping messages with highload wallet? (reply to 103963)

Bahar: Hi everyone!  I have a question regarding running a TON fullnode or liteserver. Any advice or troubleshooting steps would be greatly appreciated!  I‚Äôve successfully installed a TON liteserver node using the MyTonCtrl tool following the official TON documentation <https://docs.ton.org/participate/run-nodes/enable-liteserver-node> and the GitHub repository <https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl>. I also allowed the udp ports of the node after installation.  After completing the installation, I ran the status command to check my node's status. However, the output only displays the <Local validator status> section. The other expected sections, such as <TON network status>, <TON network configuration>, and <TON timestamps>, are missing.  I‚Äôve reviewed the setup process and believe all steps were followed correctly. Could it be related to configuration files, node synchronization, or something I might have missed during installation?   Thanks in advance for your help.

Web360: Hi lads!

Web360: Hypothetically, if someone was building the first ever betting platform in Whatsapp and TG and had implemented fiat deposits but wanted to integrate TON wallet for crypto deposits - how would they go about that? üëÄüëÄüëÄ

&rey: Well, conditioning on void proposition "first ever betting platform" isn't that needed, but to the point: Telegram has been pressured by certain corporate entities to disallow TON usage in certain TMA contexts which you'd need a lawyer to truly get; Telegram also disallows something of betting by ToS.

I can't understand how exactly the initialization vector (IV) is formed for encrypting AES packets.  For ADNL TCP, it is clearly described which bytes are taken during the handshake procedure (the shared secret key and the SHA-256 result). And after the handshake is completed, from the sent packet.  In the UDP documentation, I was able to find the key formation, but I did not find the IV, perhaps it is similar to the TCP algorithm?

Aleks: Deploying an NFT collection, there is this interesting behaviour where some NFT itmes of the collection won‚Äôt show the collection name but its address (on clients like wallets and explorers; metadata is good).  For example the Gatto | Official NFT storage when you look at a specific item in an explorer, it doesn‚Äôt show the collection name but instead the collection address. The logo of the collection is also not shown (on an item page)  We have 2 collections on testnet that used the same deploy scripts and one has the collection name on the UIs whereas the other only shows collection address.

Barus: Hello TON experts, I have a task   Create a trading API for the TON network. To buy and sell meme coins that get listed on dedust.io as that is where a lot of them arrive first (a bit like Raydium on Solana). Provide any necessary tools or API to convert the seed phrase into the Private Key needed  If anybody is confident about this task, then please contact me.   This is just creating buy and sell API on TON chain.   Programming language is node js  Deadline is 2 ~ 3 days.   Thank you.

&: Do you know the structure of that cell? Then you can do it. (reply to 104250)

&: Do not care about that errors. That error comes out due to unexpected token transfer. To be perfect, a token should send to other jetton wallet, and jetton wallet should send notification to it's owner wallet, If this logic is wrong, tonviewer shows error, but anyone can fix this logic. (reply to 104146)

Michael: I don't know about it. It's my first time doing it. I'm just looking for a way to decode it (reply to 104254)

Champer Wu: you need the other package to do it like @ton/ton @ton/core,  and transfer the boc to cell then parse it https://ton-org.github.io/ton-core/classes/Cell.html#fromBoc (reply to 104250)

Nerses: Hi everyone,  I‚Äôm building a smart contract that needs to send notifications (messages) to users for certain events. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a standard message format or structure that works with different wallet versions. My aim is to make sure these notifications are compatible across various wallets so all users get them.

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: Hi!

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: Does anyone know this transaction error? https://testnet.tonviewer.com/0QCLQG7k6kiPDpdue7-BsbEMSYEOf4CXs6skgHi6AArqhLV6

WG: Hello, could anybody help me creating a data structure like map[string -> object] in FunC?

Kapil: Can we dump the value on the testnet

Haint: you can use dictionary, and hash the string to int and use it as key note that the keys need to have the same length for object just use cell (reply to 104289)

Suhara: Hello guys, how convert EQ to UD üôè

WG: could you let me know how to use 5 dictionaries? When I try to save data, I get Cell Overflow error (reply to 104292)

Haint: cell overflow means you store more than 1023 bits or 4 ref just reduce the store data or design a different schema (reply to 104294)

WG: ref means dict? (reply to 104296)

Haint: ref means cell. a cell can reference up to 4 other cells

WG: map[string -> object]  regarding this, can I still do the same for  map[address -> object]? (reply to 104298)

Haint: yes, you can (reply to 104299)

Haint: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/vesting-contract/blob/main/contracts/vesting_wallet.fc  you can see a reference implementation here, in this they have a "whitelist" cell that is a dictionary of address => cell.

WG: is this correct implementation example? (reply to 104300)

Vincent: Is there a way to console in the mainnet to debug?

Haint: you cannot store 5 dictionaries in one cell. You can have max 4 other cells referenced from a single cell (reply to 104302)

WG: In this case, the main cell has 3 cells, doesn't it?   ref_cell, dict_registered_customers, dict_all_transactions (reply to 104304)

Haint: okay, I thought they were the same because the names are similar (reply to 104305)

&rey: Please note that it'd be more optimal to use dt~load_dict() directly; it uses single zero bit if dictionary is empty (and 1 bit + 1 ref otherwise). (reply to 104302)

Haint: I thought they do it because the data might not have any more bit (slice_bits() == 0), if you use load_dict would it throw exit code 9? (reply to 104308)

WG: Yes, I am getting exit code 9 (reply to 104309)

WG: How can I resolve this issue? (reply to 104309)

Haint: a lot of things can cause exit code 9. You better put ~strdump in places where you suspect can cause error, to see which line is the issue (reply to 104312)

Haint: ofc you need to run unit test to see the log

WG: So this structure has no issue atm, right? (reply to 104314)

Haint: why not? We dont know how you save the data, so it's totally possible the schema you use to read the data is different from the one you use to save it (reply to 104315)

Haint: as I said, your best shot is to use strdump to debug the code

WG: this is the way I saved data (reply to 104317)

WG: I see. Could you give me links for strdump usage docs? (reply to 104318)

Haint: https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/builtins#dump-variable (reply to 104320)

&rey: You'd just store enough null dicts (zero bits) when initializing contract. (reply to 104309)

WG: I am using @ton/ton npm library, how to get the logs from the strdump/dump? (reply to 104321)

Haint: just run unit test, it will automatically show (reply to 104324)

Kapil: Is there a way to console in the testnet to debug?

WG: They say to use dump/strdump, and run unit test (reply to 104327)

Kapil: How to get the logs

Liora: Is there any way to use my solidity marketplace contract to mint nfts on ton ?

FakeName: Can anyone help me here ?  I'm getting error from Ton Api.  the transaction works pertfectly sometimes & sometimes I'm havin this issue

&rey: No, at least because those are very different blockchains. (reply to 104469)

Liora: Thx i read about messaging mechanics in ton, doesn't useful ? (reply to 104472)

&rey: It is very useful, in contrast to Solidity-specific knowledge. (reply to 104473)

Liora: I imean to send message to solidity contracts and get the result (reply to 104474)

Liora: For instance sending message to solidity contract to mint nft

&rey: Those are incompatible. You'd better create a new collection on TON. (reply to 104476)

Liora: Thx i got. Could you a sample git for nft marketplace on ton? (reply to 104478)

Liora: In func language?

Liora: You mean nfts are preminted ? (reply to 104498)

H: Yes , the Marketplace contract and sale contract provide you to put nft to sale, yes first you must have the nft to be able transfer it. (reply to 104500)

Liora: I actually need this way

H: So i think you don't need marketplace and sale just customized your collection contract (reply to 104502)

Liora: In the solidity we have ERC-1155 and ERC-721 standards to create nft collections. In ton are these standards too? (reply to 104507)

Liora: Could u send the link? What do you mean of TEP? (reply to 104511)

C.: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs (reply to 104512)

C.: ERC-721 means Ethereum Request For Comment. It is same logic in here (reply to 104512)

C.: TEP-62 = ERC-721

C.: TEP-74 = ERC-20

Liora: Great, in 721 we have for example an specific collection in which each token is unique like an art (reply to 104514)

Liora: In Tep-62 every token id is completely unique ?

Liora: Do you familiar with hamster mini aps ? The cards in the hamster are nfts?

Frainkly: is that correct?

&rey: More than previous code, but still incorrect. No bip39.mnemonicToSeedSync, but TonWeb.mnemonic.mnemonicToKeyPair instead.

Ahab: Hello @pcrafter, how are you doing? I would like to ask about jetton transfer in node.js If I know my wallet seed, jetton contract address, and receiver address, how can I transfer jetton using node.js? Please help me kindly.

&rey: address.toString(false) IIRC, though why? (reply to 104705)

Champer Wu: I was asking my partner and I got the summary as following, share for everyone 1. through getTransactions  get the code of `stateinit`Ôºåafterward compare the boc Ôºàfirst transaction would include stateinit certainlyÔºåand it contains code and init dataÔºâ 2. checking state init is avaiableÔºåbut it doesn‚Äôt work on modified codeÔºàbytecode would be differentÔºâÔºåor follow TEP180 query get method id  getAccountInformation would get state init

Frainkly: cause if i run it said address cant decode (reply to 104707)

&rey: May https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#how-to-construct-a-message-for-a-jetton-transfer-with-a-comment help you. (It's by far not the best idea to use node.js for backend interaction with TON; pytoniq has better ways to write stable code.) (reply to 104703)

Ahab: Btw, I am using node.js backend so it's unsafe for jetton transfer? (reply to 104710)

Champer Wu: but the malicious code may be disguised as certain contracts  and the method querying get method id as known wouldn‚Äôt recongize it

&rey: Any external message may be lost instead of initiating transaction tree; I do not know how are you going to handle this in JS. In Python, transfer-certainly script takes 200 lines of code. (reply to 104711)

Ahab: Okay, thank you üôè (reply to 104713)

&rey: Well, such a contract will get recognized as a jetton (or something other). (reply to 104712)

Prince: just use API on frontend (reply to 104734)

Adam: is there really no way at all to make transactions confirm faster? it takes like 2 minutes to confirm a swap on stonfi, which is very long compared to other blockchains

Nerses: I‚Äôm working on a TACT smart contract where I need to send a text message to users that includes some variable data.
