NuSs: hi, how can i get test tons? I tried a bot in teleram, but I could never get any ton :( (reply to 14284)

doni: is your wallet on testnet ? (reply to 14285)

Rasoul: It is strange to me that no one knows the answer (reply to 14272)

NuSs: uhmmm idk, how can I check that? I thought it was (reply to 14286)

doni: which wallet ?

doni: you can use a block explorer   try tonapi.io (reply to 14287)

Rasoul: How can I access it directly from the network itself? (reply to 14290)

doni: checkout toncenter api

Rasoul: Is a node not directly accessible? (reply to 14292)

doni: it is

doni: you need to use lite client protocol

doni: there is a good npm package for that

Rasoul: tonapi.io  Does this website work the same way? (reply to 14297)

doni: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton-diamonds/ton-lite-client

doni: yes eventually  when you query a full node   you query its lite server ‚Ä¶  toncenter is an http layer over lite client api ,  lite client works over udp (reply to 14298)

NuSs: How can I add my wallet to test net?

G.H.Xu: ImportError: cannot import name 'BitString' from 'bitstring'

G.H.Xu: When executing "toncli start simple_storage"

Andrey: pip install bitstring==3.1.9 (reply to 14310)

–º—É—Ö–∞: Which api i should use, to get sold nfts for some collection?

G.H.Xu: Thanks, that works (reply to 14313)

Slava: No, both networks are now using TON coins and the testnet coins have no direct value. (reply to 14312)

Slava: I guess you can forget about that. (reply to 14317)

NuSs: Is there any documentation? (reply to 14308)

Slava: See the pinned message? (reply to 14320)

NuSs: I started by the hello world but there says that I need a wallet, I thought it was in other networks where a wallet lives in main and in test. But I think I need other previous documentation

NuSs: I think I have to start from this:  https://society.ton.org/how-ton-wallets-work-and-how-to-access-them-from-javascript

Daniil: I mean where did you get this hex from? What does it mean? (reply to 14328)

Javad: it's from transaction in_msg (reply to 14329)

Javad: from this site : https://dton.io/ (reply to 14329)

Daniil: Is it transaction hash? (reply to 14331)

Javad: no it's destination address hex (reply to 14332)

Javad: in_msg_dest_addr_address_hex

Javad: What should I do ? (reply to 14332)

Max: You need to know the workchain of the account (0 or -1) then you can find the account in any explorer with address format <workchain>:<hex> without the <> brackets

Andrey: This is address (reply to 14328)

Andrey: Just add workchain to it

Andrey: 0:E4148E2538CAE1D2252952B5F724B43DAD79CE2B341BB58DB74893C133EA8798 e.g.

Javad: Thanks  but in tonscan show like this   EQDkFI4lOMrh0iUpUrX3JLQ9rXnOKzQbtY23SJPBM-qHmGeh (reply to 14340)

Max: this is the "friendly" format of addresses  you can find an example of how to serialize addresses to this format here https://github.com/ton-community/ton/blob/17b7e9e6154131399d57507b0c4a178752342fd8/src/address/Address.ts#L147 (reply to 14341)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): News   - Updated open-contracts with fixed version of EC math. Now it (should) work with any Elliptic Curve (even pairing friendly ones, imo). I included only secp256k1 paramters.  The main problem is that ecMul with large scalar will easly reach gas limits, making the library non-functional. A better approach could be to create a verifier contract that save the stack and send a message to himself to continue the computation, but I'm not going to implement it.   https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/tree/main/contracts/crypto/elliptic-curves (forwarded from Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox))

doni: send me in dm your address

Step: is it possible to validate address using tonweb without making any api request?

Daniil: Depends on what do you mean by "validate" (reply to 14360)

Step: like address format (reply to 14361)

Daniil: You can try tonweb.Address() (reply to 14363)

Step: like this? tonweb.Address(address)

Slava: try { new Address(addressString) } (reply to 14365)

Step: what is the difference in isBounceable: false|true? (reply to 14366)

Daniil: If you send coins to unbounceable address, you won't get them back in case of some error (reply to 14367)

Step: but why ton decided to have such different type of address? these exists in other network? (reply to 14368)

G.H.Xu: An error appeared when I sent a message to a contract

G.H.Xu: This is the contract shown in a tutorial, I have deployed it on the testnet successfully and I am able to call a getter method

&rey: Because otherwise you would be unable to initialize new contracts at all - money would instantly bounce back. (reply to 14369)

Hartmann D.: Mami, use English please. (reply to 14376)

G.H.Xu: Is TL-B neccessary for contracts?

G.H.Xu: Can it be generated automatically?

User<5126596027>: Now more often TL-B is used as a supplement to the documentation of smart contracts, written manually. To my knowledge, TL-B compiler in ton c++ monorepo can generate code based on TL-B, but I haven't seen any cases where this has been used in practice outside of ton monorepo. (reply to 14387)

Step: how to solve this error LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot apply external message to current state : Failed to unpack account state

Daniil: This error can appear in different situations. It often happens when you're trying to interact with a not deployed contract (reply to 14390)

Daniil: What did you do exactly?

Step: looks like private key mismatch (reply to 14392)

Step: can you tell me how to convert keyPair to seed? that i will import using tonweb.utils.keyPairFromSeed ? (reply to 14392)

Daniil: If you already have a keypair, you don't need to convert it to anything, just use it in tonweb (reply to 14394)

Step: i need to store as seed that i will use later. (reply to 14395)

Step: size of seed is smaller than secretKey so i prefer seed? ü§î is it wrong practice ?

Step: ü•π

G.H.Xu: "Request failed with status code 429"

G.H.Xu: Why do I always get this error?

G.H.Xu: So I do not have to learn how to use TL-B for contracts development, right? (reply to 14389)

Step: api has very tight ratelimits. (reply to 14404)

Step: register in bots to get api key with increased limit i.e 10r/s   @tonapi_bot -  tonapi.io @tonapibot  - toncenter.com (reply to 14403)

G.H.Xu: Thanks

Daniil: It is not necessary but still important if you want to develop something big (reply to 14405)

G.H.Xu: I am a newbie, and do not find any scenario I can use TL-B, perhaps I will find one later

Daniil: TL-b is usually used to describe how smart contracts interact with each other. Usually when you write a contract, you also write a tl-b scheme where you explain the format of data that your contract takes as input and maybe return in response (reply to 14410)

Daniil: It is required mostly for internal & external messages because they don't have some exact format for message body. Developer can put any data in any format in it

G.H.Xu: So, is this similar to an api doc?

Daniil: It is similar to ABI for ethereum contracts, but more customizable (reply to 14413)

Daniil: TL-b is a language that can describe how some data type should be serialized and deserialized from binary format

Step: sometimes after auction ends if someone send ton to auction item contract address ton is coming back to sender, is it manually triggered or automatic by contract? (reply to 14411)

Step: is there any book to master skill on ton smart contracts?

Daniil: I'm not sure but probably that behaviour is defined in contract's code, or maybe it just raises an error so coins are bounced back to the sender (reply to 14416)

Daniil: Whitepaper and docs (reply to 14417)

Step: noob programmer cant gain anything from whitepaper. üòè (reply to 14419)

Step: in ton , address contract type is unknown until there is first outgoing txn?

Daniil: It just should be deoloyed (reply to 14422)

Daniil: And when we're talking about wallets, they're usually deployed with the first outgoing tx

Step: yea this (reply to 14424)

lin: Send 0.01ton to an account, why is it always returned 0.009

Andrey: Because of transaction fee (reply to 14426)

lin: Are transaction fees too low?

Andrey: Yep (reply to 14428)

lin: Do I need to specify a fee to create a transfer transaction?

Andrey: No, it is constant and depends on the executed code (reply to 14430)

&rey: By the way, seed + publicKey = secretKey. (reply to 14397)

Step: yes thanks. (reply to 14446)

Step: is it possible to send ton to 2 different address in single txn ?? (reply to 14438)

Mr. John: yes

Mr. John: you can send up to 4 tx with v3 (or v4) wallet, and up to 255 with highload wallet contract

Step: can you direct me to any tonweb example that implement this? (reply to 14452)

Mr. John: I don't know if tonweb has this kind of examples

Step: ü•π

Mr. John: https://github.com/tonstack/ton3

Mr. John: here is ton3 highload wallet example

Mr. John: https://github.com/tonstack/ton3-contracts/blob/main/src/wallets/wallet.ts#L63

Mr. John: also here is source of <4 tx for non-highload wallet

Step: i want example for v4 address in tonweb

Daniil: Nobody "owns" TON. Idea and early development - Telegram. Currently - open source devs. (reply to 14464)

Andrey: your conclusions are strange, what makes you think so? (reply to 14466)

NuSs: this makes no sense, can be an open source project, but someone has to be the person who pay the deploy of the contract, receive the x millons of tokens, etc. (reply to 14465)

NuSs: also makes no sense, can be usa, china, singapur, all world, woth no proff is better not to talk (reply to 14466)

NuSs: I think is a good question, I just knew that the first time was telegram creator, but after some bad steps he stop the development and transform it in a open source, and other people continue, but dont know who is current owner of the project (reply to 14464)

Daniil: I don't understand what do you mean by "the person who pay the deploy of the contract" (reply to 14468)

Daniil: nobody is "owner" (reply to 14470)

Daniil: there are some core developers who write the most code of TON, but they don't control the whole network. Validators do. But the thing is that there are a lot (200+) validators and that number will only rise with time.

Daniil: Nobody can change something in TON without 50%+ of validators confirmations

User<5321317577>: You think we need Proof Of Reserves on exchanges or entire ecosystem?

NuSs: so, one questoin, who is the person or community who deploy TON on the blackchain? TON can not have an owner but do  a resposible person/people

NuSs: ok, until I can see reading a little (in other words can not be the truth at 100%), just for your knowledge:  the responsible team of current TON is TON foundation (previously NewTon) and the people who deploy the original testnet was Durov, and testnet2 (currently mainnet) NewTon, and I understand that people in charge of eveything is:  https://github.com/orgs/ton-blockchain/people

NuSs: is good to know who worked on the project one is involved

davide: hello, where is the line of code that specifies the price of a Jetton? here, where i mint the token, I can‚Äôt even set a price! https://minter.ton.org

RocketMan: it is not ICO contract, it is just jetton contract (reply to 14662)

davide: so a jetton hasn‚Äôt a value ? (reply to 14663)

davide: I understood that it was the equivalent of tons of the ERC20

RocketMan: jetton is kinda ERC20 token (reply to 14664)

davide: an ICO contract can be a jetton contract? (reply to 14663)

davide: so a the jetton contract‚Äôs value is set by market (reply to 14663)

RocketMan: you could make ICO inside jetton minter contract (reply to 14667)

RocketMan: yes, you need to list your jetton on some dex, set its price by your project, back it by providing liquidity, etc etc. (reply to 14668)

davide: but the price how is set (reply to 14670)

davide: and In a contract I can write that if the price of the token is at 5$ (for example) it burn some token?

Max: You cannot set a price for erc20 too, because it is not a part of the standard  Most erc20 tokens have value because you can swap them on DEXes and CEXes, and the price is determined from them

Max: You can run an ICO for an erc20 token, but it is not part of the standard  The exact same principle applies to jettons

davide: Ok, but I don‚Äôt know how DEX/CEX set a value. do they add code? (reply to 14673)

Max: No Say a DEX has a BTC/USDT pair If there are 10 btc and 150000 usdt in it, it means that 1 btc is worth 150000/10=15000 usdt (susceptible to slippage and price impact)

Max: These 10 btc and 150000 usdt are the 'liquidity" that Aleksandr was referring to

Max: And are usually provided (at least initially) by the creators of a token if it is a new token

davide: mmh ok

Max: You may provide less liquidity for example 1500 usdt and 0.1 btc, but that would cause huge price impacts even for small swaps

davide: is there an open source dex on ton ?

davide: but if in one exchange I provide less liquidity than in anorher, the token would have a different value? (reply to 14680)

Adil: hii

Adil: how can i get ton testnet?

davide: sorr guys for all the questions üòÖ. i have a last: how an algorithmic stablecoin mantain price pegged to 1 dollar if the price of the token is set by the exchange? How the smart contract knows if the token is unpegged?

RocketMan: yes but arbitrage between dexes will do the job (manual or automated, doesnt matter) (reply to 14683)

RocketMan: if it is pegged, it means you can change it to real dollar somewhere, then again arbitrage between different exchanges does the job (reply to 14688)

Max: yeah but that only works for custodial stables (reply to 14691)

Max: for algorithmic stablecoins you need to read the whitepaper of the stablecoin itself

Max: depends on implementation

RocketMan: ah, that's correct

Max: from what I know (very unsure about my knowledge in this), they are usually backed by some other, unpegged token, and if the price goes down (idk how the smart contract knows that price is dropping), that other token gets sold to maintain the peg

Max: an example would be UST and LUNA

Max: not sure about that right now, none that I know of (reply to 14682)

Dario: Yeah, and if in a dex a trade is traded >1$ usually you can mint more from stable protocol itself (by lending etc) and sell them to lower the price (reply to 14696)

davide: yes the problem is how the contract knows? (reply to 14696)

altoshi: SC gets data from oracles (reply to 14696)

Dario: If its backed by crypto, usually they use oracles, a fancy word to say that someone push the data inside the smart contract (reply to 14701)

Max: in ethereum and other EVM networks there's chainlink for example

davide: and in ton,? (reply to 14704)

Vladimir: Can you give a link to everybody?   If not, why do you say it is open source? (reply to 14719)

Step: does not open source neutralize the competition? (reply to 14742)

Step: it is the reason why telegram server is closed source. (reply to 14748)

Step: ü§£

Vladimir: That is a different topic where you can bring gitlab vs github and other examples of open source vs. closed sources.  But if someone says that a code is open source he/she must show the sources, otherwise better he/she should say the sources are closed. (reply to 14749)

Vladimir: Personally for cryptocurrencies I will not trust anything without sources that I can audit and compile.

User<5321317577>: Does TON only use Fift language and where can I learn it?

altoshi: TON uses FunC, which compiles into lower-level Fift  But you can use Fift, which is 100x harder than FunC :) (reply to 14974)

User<5321317577>: 100x harder?üò¢  Is it also harder than C# or Python? (reply to 14975)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): thanks, what about bip44? i saw all library are useing incorrect method like mnemonic > seed > keyPair but it should be mnemonic > seed > bip44-path + index > keyPair, all popular blockchains use this like bitcoin, eth, sol... (reply to 15021)

Slava: We don't commonly use BIP44 in TON. There's a wallet ID option, that allows you to generate multiple wallets from the same private key. (reply to 15023)

Slava: However, I think I saw an implementation of TON HD wallets somewhere. (reply to 15024)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): yes, is have to read the v4,v3 wallet, but what if i want use more then one privateKey? I saw in the Satoshi lab TON with path number 607 is it right? (reply to 15024)

Slava: You can use as many private keys as you want. One for each contract. The way you generate them is up to you though. And if you would use some non-standard generation approach then your wallet contracts will be incompatible with the existing wallet software. (reply to 15026)

Yuri: Thanks mate! (reply to 15001)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): i fully understand it, i mean currently i see the issue with generate keys in the TON software, becouse any cryptocurrency has standards which support all platforms. If TON has a path of bip44 standards i don't understand why it doesn't use in the ecosystem (reply to 15030)

Yuri: Maybe it should be left in the docs which is the supported version

Slava: This could be a legacy. TON has a long history and several core development teams in the past. (reply to 15032)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): a good approach, i already implemented the bip39, bip44 for TON (javascript only) for derive path which use ed25519 by defualt üòåüòåüòå (reply to 15034)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): i have tested success it. with https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md

Slava: By the way, why do you think that HD wallets is a better approach than the current one?

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): * this is the industry standard * there are 2 possibilities, generating wallet (via contract, HDKey) * it separate keys of others chains * also important is for developers to understand how it works (that's what standards are for) * last one, seed gets 512 bytes, tweetnacl which uses in the library use 256 for derive * if you lose a privateKey, you lose only one account, not all addresses (reply to 15037)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): i think if i will make a TON wallet, i will add both methods, so users can manage via bip44 and v4 wallet

Slava: Seems fair :)

A question from another newbe, which stuck at the very beginning)) I took a "hello world" project, added .env with variable DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC with private key of my wallet, containing 24 words separated by space as per instruction at github. Then build is succeeded, tests succeeded, but deploy failed with the logs attached. The thing is that for some reason this is unfamiliar wallet address, it is not mine. Any help would be nice and sorry if someone already asked the same :)

I want to test my contracts using tonstarter-contracts(https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts) I write a hello function that always return 1, but dont know how to test. I write test code that imitate the code in test/*.spec.ts but it doesnt work. I notced that contracts/main.ts storage some mapping relation between contracts function and hex int, should I add the relation about my hello function? and how can I find the corresponding hex int? Can that be automatically? Any help would be nice and sorry if someone already asked the same :)

J: without a HD wallet, it's hard to switch to different addresses for different purposes, so users are re-using the same address for everything (reply to 15037)

Behrang: Just consider that in TON, the sender address is very useful (based on my current knowledge). So using a new address for each transaction may not be useful.   For example, if you stake your TON in a nominator pool, you have to send the withdrawal request from the same address. (reply to 15038)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): You are absolutely right, for me the best way use one privateKey for one address, but the an option of v4 wallet seems maybe need someone, I think need support both (reply to 15130)

Yuri: By the way. I'm new with the network, do you know how I can change the default wallet from toncli to one I have control?

Toan V: which machine you use?

Toan V: OS

Yuri: Windows for now

Toan V: I dont know how to, but you can transfer TON to this wallet for deployment testing (reply to 15140)

Toan V: change to your main wallet is risk for sure

Toan V: I use macos, I follow with tutorial https://github.com/romanovichim/TonFunClessons_Eng/blob/main/1lesson/firstlesson.md (reply to 15143)

Yuri: Yeah, I wonder why I can generate other addresses from the HD wallet, I provided a mnemonic to TON wallet

Yuri: Ah yeah, this is exactly what I'm doing hehe

Yuri: But got stuck on deployment because no tons

Toan V: it isnt HD wallet, I see it has mutil variant wallet version (reply to 15148)

Yuri: Would be nice to have something like "Metamask". I'm doing a project with some partners, currently building on Ethereum, but we're exploring TON to do so.

Toan V: openmask

Yuri: Hmmm

Toan V: https://www.openmask.app/

Toan V: this is metamask version for TON

Dev: For some of the articles you need git installed, and make, cmake to compile. Otherwise the first article by Tal Kol will show you where to get the binaries.

Dev: you can pull the latest ton source from git repo and make. You just need the git installed, cmake and make.  If you are on a mac you need to update PATH in .zshrc file to include the /build/crypto where the build func etc are or you can move those to bin directory. (reply to 15270)

play of the game: Hi, How can I have some array structure in the permanent storage of my smart contract? The only feature I need is being able to iterate through it. Random access isn't necessary but it would be better for me. Thanks in advance

play of the game: Also what if I want such structure in the smart contract runtime (when the code is being executed, say I'd want to store an array of some type) (reply to 15300)

shotaro üíß: the most popular defi oracle is a third party oracle network that is called chainlink. Unfortunately, in practice, the oracle network is backdoored by a multisig and chainlink and first party api provider partners have reputation at stake and relatively robust infrastructure, and its token currently has zero usecase except speculation.  ultimately an AMB bridge would be effectively a multisig secured by validators but works sufficiently well for low value high volume. there are a few zk bridges in development but nothing deployed live on an evm chain (validate the consensus and blockheader of another chain as a zero knowledge proof).  There are other oracles like API3, and Reality.eth paired with a decentralized arbitrator like Kleros. These oracles are secured partially by the network effect of integrated parties and staked token collateral. The idea is that the most secure decentralized oracles concentrate their token liquidity and security on a single chain and message pass results to other chains. I want to message pass oracle results from oracles with network effects to TON. (reply to 15292)

Daniil: Use tuples and serialize them into cells (reply to 15300)

play of the game: I don't quite get the logic behind serialization. What resources do you recommend? (e.g. My array may get arbitrarily large whereas a single cell storage is some constant bits. So I'm guessing some kind of pointer is stored in that cell but then, where exactly is my data stored?) Also any code examples would really help me out. Thanks again (reply to 15303)

Daniil: Cells can have up to 4 references to other cells. You can store almost any amount of data in your contract (reply to 15304)

play of the game: Oh I get it, so this serialization basically creates some kind of linked list structure from cells to be able to store any data right? (reply to 15305)

Daniil: You can go in two ways:  - create a bamboo-like tree of cells, where each of them have exactly 1 reference (except for the last one)  - create a regular tree, using all 4 references for all cells  Both ways are correct. First one is more simple in realisation but it will require you to parse all the cells in the worst case to retrieve only some part of data.  Second way is a bit harder to implement but you'll be able to access any part of data by parsing just log4(N) cells. (reply to 15306)

Daniil: If your contract don't need to retrieve data partially and you need to get the whole array, first method is fine. Because you'll anyway parse all the cells

play of the game: Hmmm. Nice thanks (reply to 15308)

&rey: >  - create a bamboo-like tree of cells, where each of them have exactly 1 reference (except for the last one)  Contracts have limited storage depth, so the array won't be able to have more than ~512 elements. https://ton.org/docs/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm_overview#result-of-tvm-execution (reply to 15308)

Daniil: Oh, thank you for clarification. I didn't know that (reply to 15312)

Daniil: But tuples also have a limit - 255 elements. If you need more elements, you just nest them. So if you implement some function for storing arbitrary tuple in cell, it will work fine

Daniil: Easy approach is a recursive function to store tuple in a cell. When it finds some nested tuple, just store it in the next free ref by calling that function again  I've used something like that on TSC2 for one of the tasks

Alberto: Is someone else having problems defining function with asm on task 4?  I‚Äôm using  int mulmod(int a, int b, int mod) asm "MULMOD";  and it works just fine here, but I‚Äôm getting compilation error when submitting to TSC bot

Alberto: I see, I will try it, thanks!

Saber: for the first task, as far as I know tpush has limit of 255 elements, and I think in one of the cases my algorithm face this limit, any suggestion or alternative to use?

Max: nested tuples (reply to 15432)

Matin: I want to have a dictionary and I don't want to pass it around to functions, I definitely want to change it's content if necessary, so you're saying I must use local variables? Also if I can't change its content, why is it called a global "variable"?üòÇ (reply to 15430)

Max: well I faced exactly that error 5 minutes ago and couldn't figure out a way to use global vars with modifying functions I, too, didn't want to pass it around you can change the content like so global_var = ...; and probably with operator assignemnts like +=, *= etc but it seems that right now you can't use modifying functions on global vars (reply to 15434)

Max: my guess as to why would probably be because global variables are not on stack usually, they are put onto the stack with GETGLOB and are set back into globals using SETGLOB, and I guess func can't figure out that it needs to GETGLOB the global before modifying function and then SETGLOB it back

Max: but idk what I'm talking about, could be something way different

Matin: global cell a; () main(){   a = new_dict();   int x = 5;   cell msg = begin_cell().store_uint(0x10, 6).end_cell();   a = udict_set_ref(a, 32, x, msg); }  that one compiles fine, but for some reason, this one won't:  global cell a; () main(){   a = new_dict();   int x = 5;   cell msg = begin_cell().store_uint(0x10, 6).end_cell();   a~udict_set_ref(32, x, msg); } (reply to 15436)

Matin: Anyone know the difference? (reply to 15439)

Max: I actually tried the first one but when there's a multiple assignment using a global var like (global, local1, local2) = ... then it doesn't work too (reply to 15439)

Max: maybe the second one translates into (a) = udict_set_ref which involves tensor unpacking too and maybe that causes the issue

play of the game: You mean like: "Blah blah"s ? (reply to 15455)

play of the game: ? (reply to 15456)

Max: well here is an example of a string representation from documentation this one is a format used for "simple comment transfers" i.e. transfers of TON with just a string comment root_cell("0x00000000" - 32 bit, "string" up to 123 bytes)          ‚Ü≥1st_ref("string continuation" up to 127 bytes)                  ‚Ü≥1st_ref("string continuation" up to 127 bytes)                          ‚Ü≥.... the 0x00000000 is the op which you don't need if you just want a string it does not provide random access however, and really I don't know what you could do to get random string access - we don't really have arrays in func unless your string is <=255 chars long, then you can parse it into a tuple and get chars using indices another (ugly) solution would be a dictionary that contains keys as indices and chars as values (reply to 15456)

Antoxa: Hello everyone, how do I get the coin rate according to the API?

Un gars bien: Hi! just viewed this and got some questions  about FunC dictionaries :  1) Can we indefinitely add key/value pairs to a dictionary ? If no what's the limit ?   2) Does FunC supports nesting  a dictionary in  a dictionary (like in Python) ? Something like :    dict test {     id1 : value1,     id2 : value2,     id3 :               id31 : value31,              id32 : value32,              id33 :                           id331:value331  }

Ilja: Is there anybody from fragment who could help with some questions about anonymous numbers?

Max: 1) your kv pair count would be limited by the key length. Say you choose key length 4 (bits) for your dict, that gives 2^4=16 possible keys, therefore 16 possible kv pairs  2) I guess so, since func dictionaries are represented by cells, and you can store cells in dictionaries (although I would probably recommend *_set_ref primitives for that, it might not be necessary however). However, I believe there is a 1024 cell depth limit, so be careful not to hit that. (reply to 15786)

Degen: Thing like Yearn farming, liquidity mining, collateralized Dept Position

Degen: Well I'm looking to what the future holds for the Telegram Open Network, the corrupt US SEC Government, wanted to stop this innovation, but the Blockchain win

Degen: You can stop the Blockchain, because the founding fathers know that the Government were coming for it, so they scheme a mechanism that will make it harder for them to break

Luke: I'm confused about how this line works. It says it loads an unsigned n-bit number, where n=64 in this case. But how do you know you are loading the variable total? Like why cant it be any other 64 bit number, or rather how does it even know what specific bits you are trying to load?

Slava: Each load* operation reads next n-bits from the bit-string and removes them. So you need to consecutively apply these operations based on the TL-B schema of your binary data. (reply to 15982)

Diako: in my website, users enter their own wallet address How do I check that the address is correct ? ( with tonweb and ton library )

Tim: It depends on which wallet they use. If extension - you ask to sign random payload, if tonhub/tonkeeper - you use their auth flow (reply to 15991)

Diako: no, i have string of public key, and i want to check the public key is correct or not ? (reply to 15992)

Tim: Tonweb address has isValid function

Tim: But usually you want to check that user really have access to that address

Andy: You have to specify the path to the fift interpreter (reply to 15972)

F: @cosmicgun, reformulate your message without advertising third-party services

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: It looks like you don't have a smart contract deployed (reply to 15926)

cosmicgun: In some play bot, devs implement generating TON wallets, if i correctly understand this process, in them bot, but i cannot find any information how i can implement it in my project. Maybe somebody knows?

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: You should specify in what language you write. There are libraries for working with TON, where there are functions for creating wallets. For example here is a library for golang: github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go (reply to 16029)

cosmicgun: C# (reply to 16030)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: I have not yet seen ready-made libraries for this language. I heard that someone was trying to start writing a library for this language. Perhaps it will be more convenient for you to communicate in another language (judging by your dual message in Russian) @tondev (reply to 16032)

cosmicgun: wow, thx. Yeap for c# i couldn't find it either (reply to 16033)

cosmicgun: if I understood correctly i can interact with HTTP req to TON Blockchain, without any library? (reply to 16033)

&rey: Creating wallet consists of three steps: 1. Generating mnemonic (generally 24 words, but really this can be a random string) 2. Calculating key pair from mnemonic (I haven't searched this in C# but almost sure there is something similar to tweetNacl) 3. Calculating contract address from public key (this requires TON-specific code for building cells and so on). This has to be implemented. (reply to 16034)

&rey: Then, to get balance you can just send HTTP request to toncenter (that's not TON Blockchain however it returns actual data about it, at least now). If you need to send message from wallet then you'll have to create signed message, serialize it in BOC format (requires TON-specific code again) and send it to network, maybe through toncenter's method sendBoc. (reply to 16034)

&rey: A kind of workaround: execute subprogram written in another language that has libraries for working with TON. (reply to 16034)

User<5736167366>: I don't understand the platform, what does it do?

&rey: Can you execute that binary from command line? If it fails to boot, toncli can misinterpret this as lack of fift. (reply to 16052)

–Ø: Excuse me, but how to launch it?I'm on Linux for the second day and I don't understand a lot (reply to 16055)

&rey: Either this way: cd /home/fera/ton  fift -V (reply to 16056)

&rey: Or this: /home/fera/ton/fift -V (reply to 16056)

–Ø: thx

&rey: If everything is normal, fift should output its version. If it doesn't, then it may mean that your processor/system is outdated or something similar.

–Ø: he told me; Invalid instruction (memory stack flushed to disk) (reply to 16060)

&rey: So you'll either need to recompile fift by yourself (sorry, but I can't give any guidance here) or upgrade computer configuration so it supports new instructions. (reply to 16061)

–Ø: thx

Step: LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot apply external message to current state : Failed to unpack account state how to solve this problem? it happens when we initiate another transaction just after doing a transaction.  is it because of seqno ?

&rey: Yes, it is related to seqno. The external message doesn't get processed immediately at the moment it's sent - instead, lite-servers will see update approximately in 30-45 seconds. This leads to two problems: 1. seqno is not updated, and second external message uses the same number so by the time second external message gets processed, seqno gets different, and the message is rejected; 2. attempt to increment seqno client-side and send second message also fails, because blockchain nodes precheck external messages before including them into set of suggested messages (and thus before finally executing transaction and including it into chain), and at that moment seqno check fails. (reply to 16064)

Luke: Is there a convenient way to deal with and load strings

Step: this error is annoying making the application not function correctly. Is there any way we can avoid it? (reply to 16069)

&rey: Two obvious choices I can see: 1. Use highload wallet; 2. Wait 15-20 seconds before sending next message (usually works, but it's better to do retry loop here). (reply to 16076)

Step: For retry we must re-fetch seqno or just call transfer function again?

&rey: Refetching seqno (or balance, it requires less computational resources as doesn't need to start TVM) is better. (reply to 16078)

Sudo: Is there a full node desctop wallet for Ton?

Dario: If you want a full node to not trust other nodes like in bitcoin, in ton there is no need to. As long you are doing all cryptographic stuff in your machine (using lite-client, for example) you will be fine.

Sudo: Is there desktop app for Ton? Not mobile one but desktop? (reply to 16098)

Luke: () execute (cell) impure asm "c5 POPCTR";

Luke: what does this line do exaclty

Mark: Will ton support other elliptic curve algorithms besides ed25519?

Behrang: Puts the cell arg to c5 register, which is the register that contains the result actions of the executed smart contract.   Effectively, you can fill it to add some output actions to it and send yourself the money locked in the contract. (reply to 16125)

Luke: thx, I have another question if you dont mind. How does this fift code send a request because from what I've read from the documentation, this only seems to output the cell into a file? How does one actually send it to the wallet (reply to 16133)

Behrang: This script creates an external message ready to be sent to the TON blockchain. You have to then send it manually. For example you can use lite-client to send this file to the network. (reply to 16134)

Andrey: The best source I know is c++ source code, I guess docs for UDP is not ready yet thats why it‚Äôs in TBD status.   Also you can look into Everscale sources in some cases they uses exact same protocols as TON: https://github.com/broxus/everscale-network (reply to 16232)

Other protocols like DHT and RLDP are based on ADNL UDP and ADNL can be used alone also.  I have implementation of both ADNLs, RLDP and DHT in tonutils-go, you can check the code here, I think it should be easier to read than c++ üôÇ   Also you can read documentation about internals, with examples.

Howard: oh!!!!! Thanks a lot (reply to 16466)

Howard: just deployed the contract, can you give me some testnet TON?

Behrang: Use this bot:  https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot  I checked it now, and its working.

Howard: So in TVM, I still can send the Tx to deploy the contract even tho I don't have any TON to pay the gas?  But the tx is never get executed, until I have the TON in my Wallet(contract)? (reply to 16469)

Behrang: When you create a wallet (or any other smart contract) for the first time, you'll given the potential address of it on the network, but nothing is deployed yet. To deploy it, you have to first increase the balance of this address, by sending some TON to it (using a non-bounceable tx, so it doesn't return back to the sender, because there is nothing there yet). Then, after the address has some balance of TON, you can finally deploy it on the network which consumes the TON on that address to get deployed.

Tim: it can, it has another app called sandbox (reply to 16473)

Reynold: Hi devs. I need help with minting an NFT collection. I have all the attributes (layers) rednered but i still need to render full collection and mint it with all the attributes. I assume this work can be done easily with ton-cli (https://github.com/disintar/toncli/tree/v0.0.4) but I still need help. I can pay for work with royalties from collection or other ways (discuss in dm) DM me if you are interested. Thanks in advance)

Mikel: libc6-i386 : Depends: libc6 (= 2.31-0ubuntu9.9) but 2.34-0ubuntu3.2 is to be installed

shahar: You would have succeeded with ubuntu18.  There‚Äôs a security flaw in libssl-dev which is why it‚Äôs not offered on ubuntu20+.   I think the library you should be installing instead is called libssl-1.0.   I can check that for you a bit later though. (reply to 16631)

Howard: hi where can check daily active Txs on TON?

Yuri: Someone, any clue? I downloaded again the binaries and still getting the same problem (reply to 16617)

Howard: can't understand this part lol  Using docker to code FunC is a disaster if you are using M1 Mac.....

Andrey: Why? (reply to 16712)

Andrey: dton.io (reply to 16708)

Howard: which means every time I want to run the code need have to run by Docker? (reply to 16713)

Howard: those commend lines is not quite convenient. I would rather use Tact tho. https://t.me/tactlang

Andrey: You can compile sources for toncli locally, it‚Äôs not that hard. But we working on crossplatform information for package managers, soon you will be able to do brew install ton and use it in toncli. (reply to 16715)

Howard: yeh, totally (reply to 16717)

Howard: that would be great!

Andrey: It‚Äôs currnetly not working and freezing. If Tonkeeper or Tonhub team will create working version of tact we will support it in toncli. (reply to 16716)

Howard: I tried to deploy the contract, but then I can't test it out locally or send TON properly to minitor the tx or do the next step. Like Ganache, or localhost like hardhat... (reply to 16712)

Howard: understood. any TBD for local Func for M1 mac support? (reply to 16720)

Andrey: Try local test engine: https://github.com/disintar/toncli/blob/master/docs/advanced/func_tests_new.md  There are many examples of good local tests in default projects like toncli start nft_collection (reply to 16721)

Howard: oh, but I can't run  toncli  locally, right? (M1 chips) (reply to 16725)

Andrey: The easiest way is to use docker, or you need to compile TON from sources (reply to 16726)

Andrey: In docker you just mount local directory with projet & config, and it‚Äôs running toncli on those project

Howard: üòµ‚Äçüí´ yes, I follow the tutorial for docker there. Can't find the files in /local/ tho, since I think I deploy successfully tho? (reply to 16727)

Malivix: I think if you reading next paragraph it‚Äôs clear  It‚Äôs not in /local/ It‚Äôs depends on what path you sent to docker for binding as config folder (reply to 16729)

Malivix: About toncli I compiled all of ton project with M1 I didn‚Äôt get any issues  There isn‚Äôt very clear doc, I agree  But for M1 build you can check https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/.github/workflows/macos-10.15-compile.yml (reply to 16729)

Howard: thanks. Let me check! (reply to 16732)

Howard: what is this for? (reply to 16732)

Howard: I am adding 'Dev' folder we just got in tutorial to the Docker sharing already btw. (reply to 16733)

Malivix: You should send valid path /path/to/‚Ä¶ Is not valid path  You should create a valid path and store config there then sending config folder to docker (reply to 16733)

Malivix: ü§î github action for compiling on mac (reply to 16735)

Howard: üòµ‚Äçüí´

Howard: not familiar lol (reply to 16738)

Malivix: Yes it‚Äôs hard You should familiar with c++ and toolchains or docker  But It‚Äôs temporary I think  Community is working on creating better dev envs (reply to 16740)

Howard: agree. Using Docker is temporary only because of M1 chips right.

Howard: can we just have a daily trend for tx? üòÖ (reply to 16714)

Tim: No, it works on m1 without docker, it's just hard to compile not matter m1 or not (reply to 16742)

Ms: Indian anyone here

Diako: I wrote data to cell with bellow code with ton library. but i don't know that how can i read from cell ? cell.bits.writeUint(1, 8); cell.bits.writeBuffer(....);

Malivix: Try cell.fromBoc If it‚Äôs Boc (reply to 16753)

Malivix: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/boc/README.md And maybe reading this help you (reply to 16753)

Malivix: For deserialization    // Create some cells const c2 = new TonWeb.boc.Cell(); c2.bits.writeUint(42, 7);  const c3 = new TonWeb.boc.Cell(); c3.bits.writeUint(73, 255);  const c1 = new TonWeb.boc.Cell(); c1.bits.writeUint8(0); c1.refs.push(c2); c1.refs.push(c3);   // Check it deserialized correctly const deC1 = TonWeb.boc.Cell.fromBoc(await c1.toBoc()); (await deC1.hash()).toString() === (await c1.hash()).toString(); (reply to 16753)

Diako: Thank you for response i use tonstarter-contract project  I have something like this.  let ts = new TupleSlice(c1.stack); let content = ts.readCell(); let content_bp = content.beginParse(); content_bp.readUint(8).toString()  i already read uint but i can't read buffer data ! (reply to 16756)

Malivix: Can you send me repo project? (reply to 16757)

Malivix: I think that project using ton package  So after parsing content you will get Slice You can use  content_bp.readBuffer(size); (reply to 16757)

Diako: I don't know what is the size ! (reply to 16760)

Diako: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts (reply to 16758)

Diako: yes, it's use ton library (reply to 16760)

Malivix: When you are reading from buffer you should read specific amount of it Depends on your cell type you have read different amount (reply to 16761)

Diako: The problem is, i don't know the buffer size i want to read content data from a nft collection contract ( get_collection_data function ) (reply to 16764)

k√•s: What is the best way to get txid of sent transaction?   In two steps like Async send with comment + later check for the comment in transactions list?  Or sync send?

Malivix: can you send me the lib you are using for get_collection_data? different contract can have different data (reply to 16765)

Diako: i use tonstarter-contracts with this function const call1 = await walletContract.client.callGetMethod(contractAddress, "get_collection_data"); (reply to 16767)

Howard: tried a bit but still can't work üò≠ (reply to 16737)

Malivix: You didn‚Äôt pass data for that folder (reply to 16770)

Malivix: I didn‚Äôt work with this contract so I‚Äôm investigating  If find something i will let you know (reply to 16768)

ùïñùïäùïíùïìùïöùï•: Anything? üôÇ (reply to 16694)

Howard: like this?

Howard: I followed this üò≠ (https://hub.docker.com/r/trinketer22/func_docker)

Alex: The docker doesn't explain how to use it. It is assumed that you learn this from other sources or already know. Therefore, I suggest you try to act according to that lesson. (reply to 16777)

Howard: yes, but still need toncli? (reply to 16778)

Howard: Thank you a lot! (reply to 16781)

Howard: $docker run --rm -it \ -v ~/Dev/test_project:/code \ toncli-local build  I run with this code to compile the .func file. But seems it doesn't work?

Malivix: so what I see after calling that function you will get this type of data like this { gas_used: t.number,     stack: t.array(t.unknown) }  after that stack should be  (next_item_index, cs~load_ref(), owner_address) with type of (int, cell, slice)  so I think you should write something like this const call1 = await walletContract.client.callGetMethod(contractAddress, "get_collection_data");  let ts = new TupleSlice(call1.stack); let next_item_index = ts.readNumber(); let content = ts.readCell();  after this, it's depends on the type of content (reply to 16768)

Alex: Perhaps you need to check your project.yaml, maybe you have nothing to build.  For the default ‚Äúwallet‚Äù project from toncli this command creates contract.fif.  alexg@Aleksejs-MacBook-Air test_for_build % docker run --rm -it \ -v ~/Dev/test_for_build:/code \ toncli-local build INFO: ü•å Build [] successfully, check out ./build (reply to 16785)

Howard: üòÇ Thanks a lot for clarifying

User<5802396425>: Which one of you would like to mentor me a little bit? I just want to some practice in Smart Challenge , but difficult for me to understand after classic langauges and have't enought time. Write me in private message.

Diako: Thank you  I have problem with type of content ! as i told, there is uint and buffer in content ! i don't know how read buffer from content (reply to 16786)

dik: Hi

Malivix: It's depends on each nft There is not any specific content  You can read data and depends on nft parse them For buffer you can check length of slice and read all buffer  If content is big there are many ref cell and you should concat all buffers  Maybe I‚Äôm wrong  But this is what I‚Äôm find from contract code (reply to 16803)

Malivix: Also if you know the structure of buffer  You can do this  content_bp.readUint(8) let l = content_bp.remaining() content_bp.readBuffer(l)  Something like this  But if content is big and have ref You should traverse on slices and concat them (reply to 16803)

Malivix: I found another function  content_bp. readRemainingBytes() (reply to 16803)

k√•s: Hey guys! Hot to properly send full balance from a given wallet? How to calc fee in advance? I want the final balance after activation to be zero.  When testing and trying to send full balance (1 TON for example) I got some weird balance drainage, 50+ internal transactions and no incoming transaction.  I‚Äôm using V4R2 and xssnick/tonutils-go library is this is important

&rey: Send message with mode 128 ("carry all the remaining balance"). If you wish also to destroy contract, use mode 160 (+32 = "destroy contract if balance is zero"). (reply to 16809)

Noah: Which aspect of Ton's asynchronous smart contract mechanism is better than other evm?

&rey: Executing contracts is "local" - it doesn't need to retreive other contracts' data, and that means that validators of a shardchain don't need to store full blockchain state. (reply to 16893)

Zeb: Hi everyone. Doing DD for the fund I'm working with. Was asking some questions in the main chat, got sent here.   Looking at tonmon, it says there is 1 shard atm. Is that correct? Is this due to that TON atm hasn't needed to shard into more yet, due to low demand?  Are there any stats on blockchain size by now? Tried finding data.  Also I was wondering, not all TON is circulating, even though all was distributed through PoW. Is the non-circulating TON staked TON? Couldn't really think of what else it could mean.

Zeb: Regarding the recent message towards dormant miners. If a dormant miner wallet does NOT make a tx before 1-1-2023. What are the plans with their balances afterwards?  Since the post is saying, it will make the tokenomics more clear, but these miner addresses could just wake up in a year or two. Happens with old BTC wallets all the time, years later. Is there a plan to take these balances, or burn those tokens?

Zeb: Sorry for all the questions, but yeah its interesting stuff and not all is clear. https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons Gives an example where a swap would take 3 messages to complete.  Couple questions here: - due tot he asynchronicity of TON, how often does this go wrong?  - can this completely be abstracted away for users? - are messages tx? would these 3 messages be included in the nr of tx here for instance https://tontech.io/stats/

Slava: Yes, one shard is enough to handle the current load. Blockchain is capable of automatically split and merge, based on the workload. (reply to 16907)

Slava: This is just to increase the visibility regarding the active funds, of course no one is going to burn anything. This would just violate trust in the distributed system and will not do any good. (reply to 16908)

Zeb: yeah exactly.. good (reply to 16912)

Zeb: Anyone else thoughts on the other questions perhaps?

Step: ü§î

Daniil: It's not necessary to take all the arguments. You can take only some of the last args if you don't need the first ones (reply to 16960)

Daniil: Tvm is stack based so your function will just pop some values from the top of the stack and ignore everything else

Daniil: But the order must be the same (reply to 16962)

Step: what if i skip any argument in between? (reply to 16964)

Daniil: The order must be the same and you can't skip something in between. You can take some number of args from the end (reply to 16965)

Step: var ds = get_data().begin_parse(); does this parse payload boc automatically?  no arguments passed?

Daniil: get_data() returns cell with your contract data (reply to 16967)

Daniil: Not a message payload

Step: so its contract storage boc?

Step: cell or boc?

Max: Boc is a serialization format for cells to be used outside tvm

Max: get_data() returns contract storage cell

Step: all data must be written to this cell? (reply to 16973)

Max: Yes and then set using set_data()

Fortune: Does anyone have any idea how to restore stack order after a recursive call? When control is handed back to the initial invocation scope, the variables in the stack in the line just after end up swapping values and are no longer the values before the call.

Diako: How store "string" in cell ?  int _item_index = 1; cell _uri = begin_cell()           .end_cell();  i want to store something like bellow data :   _item_index + ".txt"

Alex: I'm not sure that it's the best way, but works for me. You can create a string as slice, then store slice in cell:  slice sting = ‚Äústring‚Äù; cell begin_cell().store_slice(string).end_cell(); (reply to 17041)

Diako: i want to merge Int with string like this : _item_index + ".txt" (reply to 17042)

Alex: well, perhaps: slice string = ‚Äú.txt‚Äù; begin_cell().store_uint(_item_index, _item_index_len).store_slice(string).end_cell(); (reply to 17043)

Diako: Okay, let me try (reply to 17044)

Alex: But, if you really need index in the string, it seems you have to (encode/decode) number by your own hands too. Because the cell with ‚Äúindex.txt‚Äù will not equal the cell with index number and ‚Äù.txt‚Äù slice. (reply to 17045)

Diako: how should i do it ? (encode/decode) (reply to 17046)

Alex: Again, I‚Äôm not sure that it is the best way, but it works for me:  Encode - Represent each number as a set of symbols [0,..,9], then write their ASCI code into a slice as uint number of length = 8. Decode - Implement from slice to number. (reply to 17047)

Luke: is there a way to set integers as value in dictionaries, or a way to convert form slice to int and back

Daniil: values are always slices. you can simply store a single integer in a slice if you only need it in a value.  int to slice: int value = 123; slice slice_from_int = begin_cell().store_uint(value, 256).end_cell().begin_parse();  slice to int: slice value = {{{dict get or something else}}} int int_from_slice = value~load_uint(256) (reply to 17122)

Howard: is it possible for @Wallet to interactive with smart contract in TON network?

N: Hi guys I'm a Dog-Noob in programming & Blockchain concept but I have high learning skills. Does anyone know any link (e.g. YouTube) to start learning how to create smart contract and daps?

N: I meant a key to start or something like that (reply to 17145)

Captain: https://ton.org/en/dev

k√•s: Hi everyone! Who knows how to properly calc storage fees for a given account?  For example I‚Äôve got js calc from https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/fees  Decoding base64 contract bytecode gives me 740 bytes  Wich translates to ridiculously low price of 0.0003 TON per year.   Is this right?

Tim: Are you sure there's only one cell?

k√•s: *corrected for 5920 bits, still got pretty low 0.00284 TON

k√•s: not sure, how to get actual data? Im decoidng contract bytecode from tonscan contract tab. This is just fresh generated v4r2 account (reply to 17153)

Daniil: There's also some data, not only code (reply to 17155)

Tim: Not sure if there's public function for that, you can try to flatten root cell and count

k√•s: thanks, will look into it.  I just wanted to undestad a ballpark price for leaving 1000+ accounts active to receive incoming transactions. So for 1000 active accounts I got 2TON is this about right? Does contracts grow overtime with more transactions? (reply to 17157)

Tim: 0.05 per year per account more likely

k√•s: got it, thanks.

Diako: int min_tons_for_storage() asm "50000000 PUSHINT"; ;; 0.05 TON  What is this code for in nft item ?

doni: each Nft-Item contract should mantain sufficient balance for paying storage fees ( similiar to rent model , you pay fees as long as you using the storage)   So each action should leave at list min ton for storage after trasnfers or any other updates ‚Ä¶ (reply to 17162)

doni: the same logic happens in Jetton contract as well

Diako: what happen if ton price go up ? i mean if ton price goes to 100$ it's mean every item needs 5$ ? (reply to 17165)

Behrang: If you already have an NFT on the network, you have already paid for it, and the price of TON doesn't matter.  However, new NFTs will cost more. In that case I think the network might decide to reduce gas and storage prices. (reply to 17168)

Diako: i want to create uri in my nft collection contract every nft item need uri, for example 0.json or 1.json  i have int variable and string variable like bellow int _item = 10 slice _file = ".json" and i want to merge it like this "10.json" how can i do it in func ?

Behrang: This might help in just converting the number part to string:  slice to_string(int n) {   builder b = begin_cell();   tuple chars = null();   do {     int r = n~divmod(10);     chars = cons(r + "0"u, chars);   } until (n == 0);   do {     int char = chars~list_next();     b~store_uint(char, 8);   } until (null?(chars));   return b.end_cell().begin_parse(); } (reply to 17171)

User<967403852>: Hi there! I'm developing a nodejs library that encapsulates interaction with different blockchains into strictly typed methods and wanted to ask a few questions regarding the interaction with project.  Right now, after a brief intro to the HTTP API I decided to reach out to the community of devs in order to get a better understanding  1. I've read a discussion in this chat about BIP39 not being supported completely. I would like to know if there is a way to generate a TON wallet from standart 12-15-18-21-24 word mnemonics consistently? Is there a derivation path?  2. Is there a way to identify a block with only an integer to make request to an API? Like in ETH BTC TRX etc

Step: 1. ton, by default uses 24 words. check https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic/tree/master/src (reply to 17176)

User<967403852>: Thanks for the answer! I see that it is possible to generate 12 word mnemonic and function doesn't prevent it. Do you know if there is any derivationpath-like tools to generate multiple addresses from one mnemonic? (reply to 17178)

User<967403852>: I've also tried to generate few mnemonics with openmask, my bip39 tool says that they are invalid

Step: seed or words? (reply to 17181)

Andrey: What you mean about "id chain"? (reply to 17183)

User<967403852>: It tells just "Invalid mnemonic", I've tried to compare lists and found that words are correct (reply to 17182)

Andrey: TON not EVM (reply to 17186)

Andrey: It has its own blockchain and virtual machine for smart contracts- TVM

User<967403852>: https://github.com/slavafomin/tonweb Does anyone know the current state of TS version of tonweb?

Slava: Well, it's work in progress. I don't have much time to work on it, but I'm trying to keep it somewhat alive. It already has bug fixes, performance improvements and new features, like a dedicated Slice class with all the useful Cell parsing methods. It also has a pretty good test coverage. But it's not up to date, regarding the latest vanilla TonWeb version. I'm planning to update it soon. (reply to 17190)

Slava: But I'm using it in production :) (reply to 17191)

Step: which project? (reply to 17192)

User<967403852>: Thanks for the info! for now think I will use both bits of TS and JS code when I will be working with TON. It's very cool to see a TS library, TRON doesn't have one lol (reply to 17191)

Step: tronweb? (reply to 17194)

User<967403852>: Yeah

Slava: Can't say, sorry. It's under NDA. (reply to 17193)

User<967403852>: Tronweb

Step: ok (reply to 17197)

Step: can you tell how to become master in ton smart contract? (reply to 17197)

Slava: The TS version is very good when it comes to source code study, I've tried to make it much more clear and readable. It even has comments :)

Slava: You need to find the TON Smart Contracts Guild and finish the quest-line there. (reply to 17200)

Step: TON Smart Contracts Guild? (reply to 17202)

Slava: It was a TES-related joke. Disregard this. (reply to 17203)

User<967403852>: )))

Dev: For new TON projects beginning now are there recommendations for versions of  FunC, cmake, toncli etc ? just latest?  Javascript vs Typescript?

User<967403852>: Do I really need a private key to estimate tx fee?

Slava: I guess so, because you still need to sign the message. (reply to 17210)

User<967403852>: Thanks, will consider it

User<967403852>: Are there any heuristic methods for approximating the fee?   I will give an example: In ETH i can use the data from gas station and ABI data to estimate fee for transfers/contract executions without requesting the network TRX has some batshit insane energy system that grants you access to constant fee values after sessions of deep dark exploration of the docs BTC just has vbytes and satoshis  Are there any ways to do something like that in TON (reply to 17211)

Slava: The TonWeb will send your message to the TonCenter (HTTP API) that will call the tonlib (a C++ library that implements TON stuff). It will execute the contract using your message and will calculate the fees without actually delivering it to the validator. If you are not on the web, it could be all done locally. There are actually solutions to execute contracts locally from JS, maybe you can use that. (reply to 17214)

User<967403852>: Can you please elaborate regarding the solutions?  Ideally I would like to know if there is way to approximate fee only knowing what I'm transferring (TON or some other currency if thers is) and sender of the transfer (reply to 17215)

Slava: I haven't tried that myself. Maybe someone here will be able to better answer this question. (reply to 17216)

User<967403852>: Thanks a lot for your help! I was very happy to have a chat with dev!

Slava: Sure, feel free to ask üëçüèª (reply to 17218)

Alex: links fixed. (reply to 17060)

&rey: There are even two of them: https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/79. Which will become official is unknown (well, and I'm an interested party üôÇ) UPD: link to proposal is https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/101 (reply to 17179)

User<967403852>: Also, I've checked current implementation of mnemonic generation (https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic/blob/master/src/functions/generate-mnemonic.ts I hope this is corrent) and found that it's incompatable with BIP39, because words need particular structure, not just random word from a wordlist. The last word needs to contain a checksum in order to be compatable with BIP39  There is a good description of this at this BTT thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5300691.0 (reply to 17221)

Slava: Yes, only a subset of ETH seed phrases are compatible with TON. (reply to 17224)

User<967403852>: ETH seed phrases? (reply to 17225)

Slava: The BIP39 seed phrases to be precise. (reply to 17226)

Tse: Hi, I am trying to build an application which requires users to prove that they own a specific address. I think providing  signature might be a way to prove ownership of an address.    But I can‚Äôt figure out a way to do it on a local machine. How do I sign a  message via the private key of a ton address? and how do I verify it?   thanks in advance!

Jaimin: Gm TON devvers!  Is anyone developing secure storage for data (within a user‚Äôs TON wallet) or otherwise.  I have a use case where I want a TG bot to access data which is encrypted and only available to that specific user. Anyone working on something like this?

Jaimin: Also separate question, is there a TON MPC solution yet where you can sign from TG?

Dario: Encrypt data with some kind of user providen key -> encrypt & serialize this data into a boc -> push data with a transaction  If the size of the boc exceed 64kb you need to truncate the message and send it in different transactions (reply to 17247)

Dario: If you want to explict store something in the Blockchain. This is a bad idea btw, better to use the solution proposed by TF which involves a contract that only acts as a frontend for storing data, to manage payments etc. Everything else.is.done offchain

Jaimin: Hmm contract proposed by TF as a frontend makes sense.. what‚Äôs TF tho üòÖ (reply to 17250)

Reynold: Hi guys. Does anybody know how to get 32 bite hex private key from your mnemonic? tonweb is giving 64 bit private key by mnemonic I need 32 bit key because this library requires 32 bit private_key here in code

Amin: Just use the first 32 bytes, it will be ok. (reply to 17263)

Reynold: thanks. something in library broken probably, because its not reading private key properly and returning invalid inactive address( (reply to 17265)

User<5319486060>: What toncoin should do 1. Building a decentralized wallet with 24 seed words. so that it shows the number of assets on the Telegram platform and money is available on Telegram 2. Creating a secure p2p transaction platform on the Telegram platform. 3. The possibility of currency exchange and people's financial activity with simple authentication for small amounts. (even with Iranian authentication for small amounts) In this case, currency exchange becomes much easier

User<5319486060>: tonhoub wallet is better than other toncoin wallets, it has only one flaw First, it has a very simple password Second, it is not possible to give a complex password to see the seed Third, it is not possible to have multiple wallet accounts in one wallet

User<967403852>: Hi, does anyone have the production ready MongoDB implementation of BlockStorage  interface mentioned in the tonweb library?

Mark Okhman on TON: Hello guys, recent few weeks we've been working on creating a universal WTON together with TF and FS Labs team, as well as DEX developers (namely, @NickNekilov, @junmoDev, @dariolol).  This united team deserves great kudos!   Wrapped TON (WTON) is a jetton that is locking TON 1-to-1 on mint and releases TON on burn. WTON is used to unify interaction between TON and jettons of TEP-74 and TEP-89 standards. There is a need to have a universally adopted WTON with a common standard of interaction and single source of origin.  As a result of this productive work, we have a TEP (Ton Ehnacement Proposal) that in-depth describes the whole initiative together with motivation, guides, specifications, drawbacks and best practices from other blockchains.  We would love to invite you on reviewing this TEP https://github.com/markokhman/TEPs/blob/master/text/0000-wrapped-ton-standard.md and writing your feedback in the pull request of the TEP.  Any feedback will be appreciated!

Amin: Investigated this issue deeper, as I encountered this issue for a ton fork I have and build binaries with GitHub. After analyzing the core dump with gdb, I figured out that the instruction causing the problem is VCVTUSI2SD, It's used by rocksdb and is an AVX512 instruction. TON monorepo builds with -march=native and all capabilities of the host builder are used, which makes the binaries less portable. (AVX512 is not widely available capability, only on special Core-X, Xeon series + Icelake series) Setting the portable flag on, solves the issue. @jtton (reply to 17115)

User<5583863023>: Hello can I use highload wallet mnemonic phrase to login on ton keeper ?

Mark Okhman on TON: Hey friends üöÄ    I‚Äôve recorded a video, that is covering some very beginner level topics - how to get data from smart-contract and how to compose a simple message to send it to the smart-contract.  Please let me know if it was useful or not. Thanks!!!

Mark Okhman on TON: Dear firends ‚ù§Ô∏è  It's been a while since I posted last video. I don't know what's the best way to conveince you, that this is ONLY and ONLY because i'm learning how to program on TON and learning the very core principles that stand behind it. And of course I'm going to share those with you very soon!  However, today I've recorded a new video for those of you, who want to try starting with TON programming. It's quite simple, but it will teach you a lot. BTW, this is a great way to learn what is NFT! Intrigued? Follow the link ‚ù§Ô∏è  https://youtu.be/wEEQLwQy30Q  Here is the tutorial. I hope you enjoy it! (forwarded from Mark Okhman on TON)

Nati: Does my mainnet wallet also exist in testnet? I was wondering if i can just use my main wallet address in testnet instead of opening another wallet just for testnet.

Behrang: It will work, however nothing is deployed unless you deploy it on the testnet.  Your address will change a little.   However, this is a little dangerous, since you may use your mainnet wallet instead of the testnet wallet accidentally. (reply to 17485)

Nati: Alright so I'll just create a new wallet for testnet - thanks! (reply to 17486)

Diako: @behrangn (reply to 17410)

Nati: Thanks for the tutorial!  Just mined my first NFT ü§© (on testnet) (reply to 17483)

Mark Okhman on TON: Awesome!!! (reply to 17490)

Behrang: Each message has a flag called "Bounce". When it is set, and the smart contract throws an exception, the excess amount is returned back, but when it is not set, the excess amount is not returned.  There are some reasons for having non-bounceable messages. The main usecase is for deploying a wallet or smart contract for the first time, which does not exist on the network, and sending any message to it will fail. Here, first you have to unset the bounce flag, so that the amount that is sent to a non-existant smart contract is not returned to you, and then you can deploy the smart contract on the address which is now funded and has enough money to be deployed.  I suspect that you have unset the bounce flag, and the amount is not returned to you.  Also, there are to types of addresses, bounceable and non-bounceable. Wallets have a complex logic to determine what to do and set the bounce flag or not. Sometimes they look at the type of the address.   In your case, if you have manually sent the transaction, check whether you have set it or not.  Here is the related TL-B: int_msg_info$0 ihr_disabled:Bool bounce:Bool bounced:Bool   src:MsgAddressInt dest:MsgAddressInt    value:CurrencyCollection ihr_fee:Grams fwd_fee:Grams   created_lt:uint64 created_at:uint32 = CommonMsgInfo; (reply to 17410)

Howard: What is the cell datatype looks like?

o8wqc: Hello guys, Is there a tutorial on compiling the ton sdk dynamic link library for android? I can successfully compile the linux version, but the cross-compilation for android fails, and I can't find the corresponding tutorial.

Diako: How can i know what data pass to contract ? for example what data pass in this transaction ? https://tonscan.org/tx/kYzszhSP6vaDyfg1RK7kWfDMzTYV-6cx8gUWvcdCA-U=

Howard: You need decode it. (reply to 17507)

Diako: what data ? (reply to 17508)

Behrang: Each smart contract accepts a few different types of input. It checks the input against those different types. If it matches one, it'll execute it.  Usually, the first 32 bits of data is the operation code and is used to identify the type of data that is being sent.  Smart contracts usually read this 32 bit op code first, and then decode the rest of it. (reply to 17507)

Howard: anyone know how to read mapping data on Smart Contract through TypeScript?

Howard: Like this

Slava: It's in BOC, you need to know the TL-B schema of the data. Then you can use any Slice implementation to read the data according to the schema. (reply to 17519)

ùì¢ùì™ùì∂ùìæùìÆùìµ: Hello guys! The support team in the general group directed me here to consult Has anyone here collaborated in the development of Toncoin tokenomics? There is an important project that needs economic analysts

ùì¢ùì™ùì∂ùìæùìÆùìµ: the development of the structure will be special, that is why experts in the area are needed (reply to 17523)

ùì¢ùì™ùì∂ùìæùìÆùìµ: As Toncoin has had a very genuine tokenomics management, the first ones I wanted to address were you

Slava: Hey! This chat is for engineering questions, not for economics. (reply to 17523)

Stanislav: Hey, sorry for fooling question, I am newbie. Where can I get about definition bounceable and non-bounceable address to see difference between them?

Nati: Bounceable vs non-bounceable addresses  The core idea behind the "bounceable" flag is security for sender.    For example, if the destination smart contract does not exist, or if it throws an unhandled exception while processing this message, the message will be "bounced" back carrying the remainder of the original value (minus all message transfer and gas fees).    In fact, bounceable=false means that receiver is a wallet and bounceable=true is a custom smart contract with own logic (for example, DEX) and you shouldn't send him any non-bounceable messages because of the security reasons.  Read more in Non-bounceable messages article. (reply to 17529)

Nati: Also, a great answer. (reply to 17531)

Howard: Hi, anyone know how to implement fromBoc? (reply to 17519)

Howard: Let say the data I got here is an Object in TypeScript, which is Boc in TVM. (reply to 17519)

Dev: This might be useful given the defn of a BoC. https://ton.org/docs/develop/func/cookbook#how-to-iterate-cell-tree-recursively

Howard: Red area is the BOC data.  And the Green area is the Cell deserialization?

Howard: üôàüòµ‚Äçüí´

Slava: It looks more like BOC represented as a byte array. (reply to 17547)

Andrey: green area - serialized boc in regular bytearray  b5ee9c72 - magic constant for BOC file format (reply to 17547)

Step: What data follows after magic constant?

‚Äî 2022-12-25 ‚Äî

Howard: Yes, the original data structure I stored is like this, does that related?   I still can't read or decoded it properly once I want to read those data directly from Smart Contract then. (reply to 17550)

Howard: what is b5ee9c72 means? (reply to 17552)

Andrey: constructor prefix (reply to 17570)

Howard: it does... looks like magic

Andrey: its crc32 of scheme

Andrey: precalculated

Howard: For `toBoc method, is there any more description for how to use this method in `tonWeb?  - What is idx for? - What is crc32 usage? - What is cacheBits? - What is flags for? (reply to 17571)

Andrey: idx - indexed cells, for optimization purposes crc32 - checksum for boc cacheBits - cache bits for optimization purposes flags - reserved, always 0

Howard: TL-B schema of the data, yeh, I know what is the input I send in.  The TL-B schema is more like this, right?  Person#1 {   name:string;   age:int; }   Then basically is a big object called Cell[] from on-chain data. (reply to 17522)

Daniil: It's size of integer in bits (reply to 17660)

Daniil: load_uint(64) means load 64-bit unsinged integer from slice

Types of property 'bits' are incompatible.     Type 'import(".../hello-world/node_modules/ton/dist/boc/BitString").BitString' is not assignable to type 'import(".../hello-world/node_modules/ton-contract-executor/node_modules/ton/dist/boc/BitString").BitString'.       Property '#private' in type 'BitString' refers to a different member that cannot be accessed from within type 'BitString'.  contract = await SmartContract.fromCell(initCodeCell, initDataCell);

Alex: Generally int - 257-bit signed integers. But when we work with cells, we can write and read only significant for us part.  Supposed, that you know what you have stored in the readable slice (from the TL-B scheme or from the code of contract that built this cell-slice). In this case, you need to read 2 integers a and b in same order they have written into your slice cs. For example: int a = cs~load_uint(32);  int b = cs~load_uint(64);  You can find out some thoughts in this lessons. (reply to 17663)

Tse: Is it possible to create a hierarchical deterministic wallet on TON?

Kirill: ‚ÄãIntroducing TON Connect 2.0  The TON community is launching TON Connect 2.0 today, an open-source standard allowing users to log in to internet services safely and without usernames or passwords.  This next iteration of TON Connect, launched in April, has received new yet important functions and was a genuine team effort from the community.  One of the key advantages TON Connect 2.0 has over its previous version is the ability to interact directly with decentralized applications based on TON. Users can now connect to mobile and desktop apps, Telegram bots, and other dApps in the interfaces of TON-based crypto wallets.  Connecting to apps happens in the wallet‚Äôs browser, and they‚Äôll be available to be used in the wallet ‚Äî without leaving the app.  TON Connect 2.0 allows users to sign in to online platforms with a single click, granting access to all of Web3‚Äôs use cases.  Tonkeeper already supports TON Connect 2.0‚Äôs standard, but other wallets have been working on implementing it.  We encourage developers and businesses to integrate TON Connect 2.0 into their products.  You can find TON Connect 2.0‚Äôs SDK documentation, helpful integration guides, and a description of the updated standard here: https://tonkeeper.gitbook.io/ton-connect-2.0-guide-for-sdk  TON Connect 2.0 has all the tools needed to become a network-wide standard.

Howard: Any research report for TON L1?

Jhsu: would love this too (reply to 17791)

üá∑üá∫ Angry: Hi there! Can you get me some examples for manual transaction, how it composed, how generate payload, for simple transfer nft from my to another wallet? Or reading about.

üá∑üá∫ Angry: I googled much times and not found answer

üá∑üá∫ Angry: This is example of external service with params for transfering with tonkeeper:  "params": {   "source": "owner wallet",   "valid_until":1672111633,   "messages": [{     "address":"nft address",     "amount":"68568779", // strange amount, how it calculates?     "payload":"te6cckEBAQEAVQAApV/MPRQAAAAAAAAAAIAJbHMqtRChqxPdhONruHmDbIW0234234234234/JKIkpbAB1yAyuxOOygw/zFrDV0iSDZdyS0uM+sadfaAFSDFasdfd45rsdfa==" // what is it? How it generates?   }] }

üá∑üá∫ Angry: But how to make same transaction, calculate values for sending with toncenter/tonweb library?

doni: you can checkout the fift wallet code ‚Ä¶ but reading fift is a bit hard   or you can go over the ton (npm) library  and view the wallet create transfer method (reply to 17794)

doni: https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator/blob/main/test/e2e.ts

üá∑üá∫ Angry: I read code, but even not sure that is about NFT transfer‚Ä¶ Isn‚Äôt there even one example of anyone? It‚Äôs just common case of NFT transfer‚Ä¶ (reply to 17800)

üá∑üá∫ Angry: Please anybody, help

üá∑üá∫ Angry: Maybe exist approach how to understand of standard NFT contract works. It‚Äôs same approach for erc NFT on ton and solidity networks or different?

doni: you can checkout tonweb examples (reply to 17806)

üá∑üá∫ Angry: I just need only two cases - mint standard ton nft and transfer them to another owner (reply to 17814)

üá∑üá∫ Angry: I need do it with node.js script

üá∑üá∫ Angry: with javascript api

doni: 1sec

doni: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/test-nft.js

doni: good luck

üá∑üá∫ Angry: I understand correctly? I think that I need create mounted contract of nft that I want interact, then call that methods for transfer and mint? I'm wondered - how call contract method was transformered to        "messages": [{          "address":"EQBU5XFJ871oiBjmmSmbQQOlbPMIIltkHhiPfz-asdfasdfads",          "amount":"68568779",          "payload":"te6cckEVAQEAVQAApV/MPRQAAAAAAAAAAIAJbHMqtRChqxPdhONruHmDbIW0z3ZYxjklMLG/JKIkpbAB1yAyuxOOygw/zFrDV0iSDZdyS0uM+B8PnIa1X5PONehzEtAIjPgFiB=="        }]      }

üá∑üá∫ Angry: How appear payload? What that means?

üá∑üá∫ Angry: And also in https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/test-nft.js - using local contract files, but I need to use already mounted contract (nft in mainnet)...

üá∑üá∫ Angry: Thus, another question, how I can get  const {NftItem} = require("./contract/token/nft/NftItem"); file of already mounted contract (of nft) ?

Hartmann D.: Hi Abdul! Thank you for your offer. I will forward it to the team for sure. BTW, you can see all available vacancies here jobs.ton.org (reply to 17867)

Howard: What is store_uint(0x18, 6)?

Dario: this stores the flags of the message. to easy read, i suggest to check  https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/blob/main/contracts/messages/messages.func (reply to 17871)

Howard: flags of the message! (reply to 17872)

Dario: yes (?)

Howard: this is more like "the standard", right? Nice (reply to 17872)

Dario: no, it cover some of basic messages that can be used in contracts in simpler way, but doesnt cover everything

Howard: oh, got it. Like the MethodCode.

Dario: its func library, its not releated to tact or anything like that* (reply to 17876)

Howard: ohhhh ok. Thank you. It make sense.

Howard: FunC looks not that difficult to learn. But it is harder to set environment than TACT ü§£

Howard: I still can't run properly on my MacM1

Howard: Sorry, why this message function is different others?  Only it use (0x10,6). Others using store_uint(0x18,6) (reply to 17872)

Anton: I am also newbie in ton development and I found the easiest way for myself to use ton development tools:  # FunC lessons without installing anything to your operating system  ## Disclaimer Unfortunately *anything* means that you should have docker installation able to access your local filesystem (or its part) with volume mounts. You should do it yourself anyhow.  ## Environment preparation  docker pull trinketer22/func_docker alias toncli='docker run --rm -it -v ``pwd``:/code -v toncli:/root/.config trinketer22/func_docker'  Use all commands as described in lessons. (reply to 17883)

Dario: it means no bounce flags, the message wont came back if the execution fails (after removing fees). Can be used to initialize a wallet when there is no code (reply to 17885)

Anton: You can install docker on MacM1 with colima, for example. https://github.com/abiosoft/colima

Dario: two note:  - errors during action phase wont trigger a bounce message - the bounced message will contain only the first 256 bits of the message body, without reference and so on (reply to 17887)

Howard: cc bounceable-messages (reply to 17889)

Howard: After reading deeply in NFT Standard.func, every indexId of NFT token should have different amount? (it's will more like ERC1155)  will it should able to set with different Royalties Fee?

Howard: Would like to know why queryId can be a "arbitrary request number" when I want to transfer the NFT.

Amin: Sometimes contracts send new messages back, notifications to the caller contract, It will have this query_id in its body. Caller uses it to distinguish the received response belongs to which call of it. (reply to 17898)

Howard: OK, then it's a number that can 'randomly' decided by caller, then the Smart Contract that being received the message can know that it's coming from the same caller / same Tx request? Is that correct?

Tim: no (reply to 17912)

Gkiokan: I am a bit lost. Can we have a way to deep link the Wallet with params so we can recieve TON as payment currency for a e.g. eccomerce shop bot?

Tim: yes, ton://transfer (reply to 17914)

Gkiokan: Any docs / api on that?

Tim: it should be documented somewhere on official docs (reply to 17916)

Tim: https://developers.tonhub.com/docs/transfer-link

Tim: you can replace https://tonhub.com with ton:// and https://app.tonkeeper.com(not 100% sure about right url)

Howard: can you explain more @TrueCarry ? (reply to 17913)

Gkiokan: Sounds promissing. Thanks.

Tim: previous message explained everything (reply to 17920)

Gkiokan: What is actually the correct jsonRPC if I want to check my wallet? toncenter or tonhub?

Tim: For tests doesn't matter, for your app - use your own instance (reply to 17923)

Gkiokan: Cuz I found this guide here but this one opens the payment links in the other wallets, I just want to stay in TG and let the user pay with their integrated wallet. I will try what you have said and report back.

Tim: oh, you mean links, not rpc.  I usually display all 3 of them

Tim: because some links don't work on some device/os combinations

Gkiokan: The RPC is for checking the Transactions then if user x has paid transaction with comment y already

Tim: use your own toncenter instance (reply to 17928)

Gkiokan: The guide I found was this one here (they are rare?) https://ton.org/docs/develop/dapps/tutorials/accept-payments-in-a-telegram-bot-js

Gkiokan: Isn't the  https://testnet.toncenter.com/ for that? I will check the docs for that. (reply to 17929)

Tim: it's for tests and development, not for prod usage

Gkiokan: Yea thats fine. In theory I should be able to set a couple payment links for the user and let them pay and search for the transactions on the testnet. (Working on a ecommerce shop bot)

Daniil: I heard that you can get them back by simply sending a number NFT to yourself

Red: Successful thank you

Gkiokan: When I am working on the testnet, Do I need a different "test" wallet?

Gkiokan: And if yes, how I am supposed to create it?

Nati: You can use your main wallet in testnet. (The wallet is not deployed unless you deploy it on the testnet.)  Your address will change a little.  Just to note that it's a little dangerous, since you may use your mainnet wallet instead of the testnet wallet accidentally.  I recommend creating a new wallet for testnet üôÇ (reply to 18021)

Nati: To use a wallet in testnet you need to change networks so the application will know to talk with testnet. What wallet are you using?

Gkiokan: To be honest I have no clue. I just create a wallet with the TG Wallet Bot as it was promoted as "integrated wallet system in TG" (reply to 18024)

Gkiokan: I am building a eccomerce shop with crypto payments for orders, so I have a couple env variables I can set this won't mix up. But I have no clue how to proceed

Gkiokan: Ideally would be the feature "pay with your TG wallet -> opens the TG wallet and you pay and you are done"  But I have seen tonhub and toncenter transfer URL's which was used in buttons.

Gkiokan: How do I deploy my wallet to the nets?

Nati: A wallet is deployed most of the time on the first outgoing transaction.  You can still recieve funds when your wallet is not deployed.  To create a wallet in testnet you should use a non-custodial wallet. You can choose one from here but I don't know if all of them are capable of interacting with testnet. (reply to 18025)

Nati: I used TonKeeper to create a wallet in testnet.  To switch to¬†Tonkeeper's testnet, tap the version 5 times in the settings.

Nati: If you need any help feel free to ask questions

Gkiokan: Thanks for the suggestion. I could create a wallet on the wallet with this link here https://wallet.ton.org/?testnet=true

Alex: Some clues for you https://ton.org/docs/participate/wallets/apps.  Also, recently was updated standard for wallets - Ton Connect 2.0 , developers right now updating their wallets.  But this is about non-castodial TON wallets, I'm not sure what do you mean about "pay with your TG wallet". (@CryptoBot, @Wallet ?) (reply to 18026)

Gkiokan: After that I could get the transactions working on the endpoint, which seems to work now.

Nati: Yep this also works (reply to 18033)

Gkiokan: My ecommerce shop bot does create payment links based on the guide on ton.org I just want it easy as possible without interacting with 3rd party wallets. (I mean the wallet is integrated in TG right?) My Ideal solution would be that the "pay with Wallet" button just opens the TG Wallet thing and the user pays. Afterward I need to check if the Transaction has been done with getTransactions (reply to 18034)

Gkiokan: Actually ton://transfer/.... didn't react to anything sofar

Alex: Wallets on your pic is not TG wallets(Wallet, TonHub, Tonkeeper  TON non-castodial wallets). From what you said about expected business process, all you need is implementing payment request via qr/deeplink for non-custodial wallets and check transaction as you said.  About ton://transfer/... was something about TG application will not allow use it for Android.  UPD. Found it here. Because of that Tonkeeper and Tonhub has their own alternative deeplinks. For example for Tonkeepr: https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/<address> https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/<address>?amount=<nanocoins> https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/<address>?text=<url-encoded-utf8-text>  Tonhub transfer links here.

Jordan: Hi everyone I would like to know if it's possible to export CSV on https://tonscan.org/ ?

Party: no (reply to 18043)

Gkiokan: yep makes sense. But for clarify, the @wallet is the Wallet that TG has integrated and it is even accecable though the attachment menu in the app itself . So is it still considered as non-castodial?   About the deeplinks for Tonkeeper and TonHub you are right and I need to stick for them to be ued like this and it's fine enough when I can pass amount and context (in my case the Order UID) (reply to 18039)

Mark Okhman on TON: The topic of contract code verification has been in the active discussion for quite some time. I was very much interested about how this could actually work, because this is one of the building blocks to a truly decentralised and trustless, yet mass-adopted, ecosystem.   We've had an outstanding conversation with Shahar Yakir from Orbs team on the ways to bring this into TON ecosystem. This is the real good quality content. Please share that with anybody interested in TON, as we should spread this kind of educational materials, in order to make one billion userbase to happen.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJOEWL560Lc (forwarded from Mark Okhman on TON)

Howard: What is "NFT collection with sequential NFT index provide easy way o association and search of linked NFTs." means?  Like "Some NFT collections might be not the index based?" (reply to 18165)

User<5718323121>: I compiled fift on ubuntu, and run fift then I got same error message "Illegal instruction"

Lev: You use the index and the collection address as the initial data for the NFT item contract. That allows you to compute the address of the item from the collection - since in TON, contract addresses are computed like hashes using initial data and code Some collections are not index-based: for instance, for domains you don't have an enumeration of domains - instead, the "index" of an item is the hash of the domain (reply to 18166)

Howard: ok, understand. That is why Domain NFT is not the collection that based on Index ID.

User<5718323121>: "Illegal Instruction"

Lev: Wdym? In an indexed collection, you store this variable and increment it every time you create an item (reply to 18174)

Lev: So you create an item with collection address and current next_item_index as starting data, then increment the index variable in collection

Dario: Hello guys, I have a question. Is this the right way to "hardencode" a value in TL-B? In my case, I want to hardencode an 32bit leng opcode  stuff_op#25938561 = StuffOP;  nvm looks like it is

Howard: do you know why my tx failed in here? Didn't get any error when compile (reply to 18181)

Lev: Runtime error, you should look at the error code

Alex: Yes, I see. I mean you can use alternatives for your main problem "creating smart contract" if you can't compile this at all. Unfortunately I don't know how to solve your building issue. (reply to 18178)

Lev: Also, I would recommend writing tests and debugging locally (reply to 18184)

Howard: How to fetch error code. I use dton explorer. (reply to 18184)

Andrey: Actions failed means, that messages you want to send can't be send. Usually this means you want to send more amount that you have on contract (reply to 18183)

Howard: It‚Äôs a token contract. So‚Ä¶. Maybe the logic about fowardFee calculation were wrong. (reply to 18190)

Howard: TVM is complicatedü´†

Andrey: I's not runtime error, otherwise dton display computation phase exit code. The computation phase works successful, but action phase failed (reply to 18184)

Howard: Oh. Ok. Thanks. (reply to 18193)

ÿ•ŸÑŸäÿßÿ≥: same question (reply to 18100)

Howard: "Auction Phase" failed usually means....? (reply to 18193)

Andrey: No_funds: 1, you're trying to send more than you have on smart contract (reply to 18197)

Howard: Thanks. Then how do we bounce the TON back for the failure Tx in 'Action Phase' (reply to 18198)

Andrey: You can't do that, only computation phase is bouncing (reply to 18199)

Howard: then I don't know how to debugging now ü•∂ü§Æüò•

pid | ton: how should i start

Howard: I am implement it to TACT language. I can't code in FunC at this moment. (reply to 18229)

Tim: It doesnt matter, tact is compiled to fift/boc anyway

Howard: question is that, followed TEP0074, why there has two different parameters as "owner"? (reply to 18235)

Tim: it's not owner

Howard: can you tell the difference for response_destination and new_owner?

Tim: new owner gets forward amount and payload response gets unspent money

Howard: but this is NFTs, no quantity in standard tho?

Tim: what?

Howard: Or` response_destination` represent the Collection contract itself.

Tim: response_destination is address where you want unspent money to return

Tim: you send 2 tons to nft for transfer, it uses 0.1, returns 1.9

Howard: More like bounced feature? Okok

User<5718323121>: I am looking for TON smart contract developer

User<5718323121>: please dm me

Howard: hi @D030N, I just implement NFT standard in TACT language and test it out. Right now my code and Txs were all success. But can't see it on https://testnet.getgems.io/.   Is it because the NFTs I created doesn't have the content or the royalty parameters?  If so, any content parameters I can use to test it out. (reply to 18218)

Tim: https://testnet.explorer.tonnft.tools/

Tim: What this site says

Howard: unfortunately, can't call even use the example addres

Howard: But thank you for support, this is the tool I exactly want!

Howard: well, it's not able to click still lmao (reply to 18251)

Tim: it means your get_nft_data is most likely corrupted

Tim: oh you mean example, yeah, it doesnt work

Tim: EQBENzLLw57mCHvc4KawY0Kyk4iZfpMS_nbXSGCPfReGzoY0 works with this one for example

Tim: you should use you contract compiled cell to test get_nft_data with ton-emulator or python tontvm, and compare return with known good nft

Howard: ton-emulator?   Do you have the template that I can test out by using the upgrade method for the collection? ( (reply to 18257)

Tim: Right

Howard: I mean the content / royalty fee setting should be upgradable. Right? (reply to 18262)

Tim: In default contract Royalty fee is set in collection. In nft single royalty is inside nft item

Tim: You should check out func sources

Tim: Getgems repository contains tests for nfts

Howard: ü•πü•π I am building on Tact.

Howard: If my contract built by Tact is correctly follow the TEP0074, then it should be passed successfully on the tool. Is that correct?   https://testnet.explorer.tonnft.tools/ (reply to 18265)

Tim: more or less

Tim: in this one yes (reply to 18269)

Howard: What do you mean more and less ü•πü´†

Tim: when you say 'passed' it usually means tests, i thought about getgems

Tim: i've already said it, it doesn't matter func compiles to fift and tact compiles to fift (reply to 18268)

Howard: Ok. Let me try. Because there is more I can expand. For example, TEP74 not even asked for Mint functions like EIP721.

Tim: check get_nft_data response

Howard: Yes. Correct. So I am trying to let my Tact file can get similar Func in the end. (reply to 18274)

Thienmylyhiep: This is an incomplete list of what has been done in 2022. A lot of new people and development teams came into the TON, and a lot of new services and applications were created.  Clearly, we all made a quantum leap this year, just as we did in 2021 when we resurrected TON project.  Despite significant volatility in the crypto industry and around the world, we continue to move forward consistently to make a truly global and massive blockchain network.  Let's do something fantastic next year. (forwarded from TON Rewind 2022)

Thienmylyhiep: TON Developers  ‚Äî Programmer contests and hackathons began to be held on a periodic basis - a dozen contests were held this year.  ‚Äî TON has become a sponsor of the competitive programming platform Codeforces.   ‚Äî Libraries improved, new libraries created: tonweb, ton.js, ton3.js, Kotlin, Rust, Go, Java, Python, Swift, C++.  ‚Äî Improved and created new APIs: Toncenter, Toncenter Index, TonApi, DTon GrapQL, Foxtails for NFT, GetBlock.   ‚Äî IDE plugins and development tools created: IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, toncli, MyLocalTON.  ‚Äî New documentation, tutorials and articles.

Behrang: When you had no comment, your code throw an exception, which is correct behaviour based on your code.

S0co | DM+ME = Block&Report: Hello is ton storage currently on testnet?

Alex: Hello, TON developers!üëã Ready to step into the 2023 TON massive adoption year? Let‚Äôs do it with Tact!  TLDR  Tact is a high-level, scalable language designed to improve the usability of smart contract development for TON. If you've long wanted to dive into smart contract development, now is the time when you can start from the very basics as a Tact developer. Definitely, your participation will be especially appreciated if you are an experienced FunC developerü§ù.  The Tact language project was originally initiated in the summer of 2022 when the original concept was designed.  In December 2022, the Tact compiler development continued, and currently work is in full swing.üåã   What next?  To improve the quality of the Tact compiler an important requestü•∫  to the great TON community is to play with the compiler according to the template project.   If you will find a BIG problem with the Tact compiler itself, we will be very happy if you tell us about it in the chat or in git issues. Also, feel free to ask your questions in chat.   If you have any questions about the Tact documentation DM me @iftryalexg  - I will disclose all questions ASAP in the documentation or answer you with a link that helps you.ü§ì

Daniil: What does mode' = mode + 1 means that the sender wants to pay transfer fees separately Mean?  Does it mean that sender and receiver will split the fee 50/50?

&rey: Not 50/50. Sender will send additional TON to cover message delivery fees, while receiver will still pay for own contract storage and processing message. (reply to 18863)

Daniil: So if I send 1 ton with mode=0, receiver will get like 0.99 (-fees)  And if I send 1 ton with mode=1, receiver will get 1 ton and I will pay 1.01 (+fees)? (reply to 18864)

–í–ª–∞–¥: Hi guys! I am newbie on TON so sorry for stupid question) But I see that there is a jeton minter tool and it should create tokens I guess. Is there any exchange to trade these tokens?

Gkiokan: When I try to send a transaction though my bot with the npm ton lib, I get this issue. error:  'LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot apply external message to current state : Failed to unpack account state'  The parameters seem to be processed correctly unti lthe transfer method is called.

Gkiokan: What means Failed to unpack account state?

Gkiokan: I've followed this guide here. But can't find any information about this error.   https://blog.ton.org/how-ton-wallets-work-and-how-to-access-them-from-javascript

Daniil: something is wrong (reply to 18884)

Daniil: maybe seqno

Gkiokan: seqNo is 0 in my logs

Gkiokan: This are my logs.

Gkiokan: Could it be something with my account type? I've used the given one which is org.ton.wallets.v4 but I#ve created my wallet though wallet.ton.org, just a couple days ago. So I guess it should be the latest type?  Where can I lookup my wallet type?

Slava: Make sure to not use this secret key from now on :) (reply to 18890)

Gkiokan: haha yea thought about it but don't worry, the secret has a bunch of other characters left that aren't on the screenshot. :) (reply to 18894)

Gkiokan: That makes no sense to me and honestly I could try the other library, but I think both are working the same way somehow so I will probably end up with the same error. Failed to unpack account state. I will try v3 to see if I get a different error.   The error is coming from the jsonRPC, so not even the library itself has a hint for that error (500).

Gkiokan: God. Really. Why does it work with the wallet type org.ton.wallets.v3.r2 ü§î

Lev: Is there a TON DNS on the testnet?

Gkiokan: Are the Blockchain Fees % based on the tx value that you send?  I am building a ecommerce shop system with marketing payment feature. Means, User buys, the Bot Wallet gets the money, takes it's commision and sends the rest to the Seller Wallet.  Easy stuff. But I am testing right now with low amount TON (0,009x) and I am ending up in having LESS TON's on the Bot Wallet due the fees.  So is this even relyable?

Gkiokan: Here a more specific example in values that I've just tested.  0.009675849 Transaction Value in TON   55% Application Fee ( our comission ) 45% gets the shop owner so 0,004354132 gets the shop owner  calc = (0,009675849 / 100 * (100-55))  Wallet Values pre and post tx. 1,991531338 to 1,99022302 on the Bot Wallet 1,01372162 to 1,017975718 on the Seller Wallet  This  means, even we get 100% and split out the rest money for the seller, we  pay more fees and have less money after the split?

Gkiokan: Bot Wallet tx list of the example

Gkiokan: Okay, another test with higher amount. 8 USD = 3,8792xx TON now.  The fees seems to be at a 1000th decimal place. So no % and this may work then.  Buy Input 3,879xx fee 0,001xx Split to Seller 1,7456xx fee 0,006xx  So we make like 2,1273 TON win out of this Transaction with 55% fee rate.

Daniil: Yes, it's possible from an explorer (reply to 18935)

Daniil: For example, the regular wallet-v3 contract is just one cell of code and one cell of data

Daniil: Each cell in that explorer output is on separate line (reply to 18937)

Daniil: And you can count bits approximately by checking the "hex" representation output length

M‚ú®: As a storage provider, how much ton do we get? What is the formula for calculating it?

Gkiokan: Can I query the transaction based on a given text without looping though all transactions?

Daniil: What do you mean (reply to 18955)

Gkiokan: I want to query the transactions based on a message from my wallet. Background of it is that I am accepting payments from my shop bot and do split payments to the seller. So before I do the split, I want to check if there hsa been a transaction before that is an outgoing tx with message of "split $orderUID"  From the testnet toncenter API I can see this data is saved in my transactions in the out_msgs (just noticed the out_msgs are arrays where in_msg is a single object)

Gkiokan: Curerntly I just get the latest 1k transactions and loop though it until I find the string. But this is not a good practice at all and may suffer in processing speed and may be not reliable at all when there are more transactions out of the limit scope.  But I am not sure, if there is a "query by data" method as the docs don't have anything about it.

Gkiokan: When triggering a transfer like this, could it be happen that the transfer will be send 2 times when it gets called multiple times?

Gkiokan: Apprently no, even I tried to call the method multiple times, I can trigger it 2 times, but while in loop it still gets transfered once. But I want to be sure why this happens only once (which is good and what I want).

Gkiokan: Just in case users try to brute force the payout process, I must predict that.

Nati: Because after a successful processing the wallet seqno is increased by one to prevent reply attacks.  And you are still sending the same seqno, which makes the wallet reject the message. (reply to 19064)

Gkiokan: That's what I thought. So even it gets brute forced due whatever, the transaction is always bind to the seqno.

Nati: Yes that's the purpose of the seqno :)

Gkiokan: But if I have valid transactions that goes out on different wallets with different payloads, they will be rejected, too until the seqno is increased then?

Nati: Each wallet has it's own seqno

Nati: I would recommend reading this.

Gkiokan: To be more precise, in my case the wallet is bind to my shop wallet for differnet shops. To take comision on orders I collect the TON on the main wallet and split out the rest to the sellers (like ebay).   So I have different to wallets depending on which order has been made on which shop.

Gkiokan: I see. The article makes sense and explains what you've told me in short already. Thanks for clarify.

–ù–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–π: How to fix "unknown magic ..." when trying to import key in storage-daemon-cli?  In keys.cpp it needed 4 byte prefix ton_api::pk_ed25519::ID. Where i can get it?  Or what valid file key format for cli tools? (saved as raw and base64 - both not working)  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ba8f700e26620707f8ff14e46cc9a040a1b3f97c/keys/keys.cpp#L163

Nati: Did you run storage-daemon? (reply to 19075)

Nati: It should generate and use a new pair

Nati: if you just want to generate one use the binary from the utils folder: ./utils/generate-random-id --mode keys

·Ö†: This one

Nati: The ZIP should have fift files are they are not platform depended (as far as i know)  You can: 1. Click on "Windows" on that page and click on the fiftlib.zip there, seem to give you a valid file hosted on the website it-self 2. Download from the GitHub releases. (reply to 19089)

–ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω: Hello! If I use the rand function several times in an incoming message, do I need to call randomize_lt before each time, or is one time enough?

&rey: One time is enough. Please note that random values after randomize_lt can still be predicted before sending message to your contract. (reply to 19126)

Slava: @pcrafter this chat is for sharing knowledge in an open fashion. A lot of people spend thousand of hours developing TON and sharing it publicly for free. Trying to sell your knowledge in the chat is just unethical.

Slava: That's all cool and funny, but I will have to cleanup the chat from the flood.

Dario: Shouldn't we ban users that write behind channels not related to ton development here?

Slava: Please stick to the development questions.

User<5061272998>: don‚Äôt delete my messages if possible. Devs also should know who they can work with and who they should not. (reply to 19144)

Vadym: How can I generate new ton address? Is it cost-free or it‚Äôs require deploying of smart contract?

Andrey: Address of smartcontract is hash of cell with StateInit:  You can learn more about smart contract addresses here: https://ton.org/docs/learn/overviews/addresses#address-of-smart-contract (reply to 19156)

Slava: You can get the address without deploying the contract by the way. (reply to 19156)

Nati: What would be the best approach for "subscribing" to all transactions of a certain contract type?  What I want to do is to get a trigger every time any contract of a certain type is processed.

Nati: The point of that is to get a trigger when someone puts an NFT on auction.

Jangju: yup

Steve: Just watch all blocks and all transactions this is quite easy to do

Nati: How can I watch blocks? Any python / JS library? (reply to 19164)

Steve: v4 api has websockets

Steve: Or you can just pull every 5 seconds for last block

Steve: Also ignore masterchain that everything would be fine

zzss: Is it possible increase fee for transaction in ton network to speed up transaction execution?

Daniil: No (reply to 19170)

zzss: is some any ways to increase speed?

Tim: there's no need to increase speed, tx is mined in <10s

Daniil: Why do you need to speed it up? (reply to 19172)

zzss: I have cases where I need to win a race with other transactions, so it can be done by increasing transaction performance or by improvements in my application (reply to 19174)

Daniil: There is no "race" between transactions (reply to 19175)

altoshi: He means gas auctions. It‚Äôs a normal thing in Ethereum (reply to 19176)

Daniil: Gas auctions? (reply to 19177)

Daniil: Oh you mean that

altoshi: Yes. The higher the bid, the faster your transaction will be completed. (reply to 19178)

Daniil: I know what it is, just saying that there's no such thing in TON

altoshi: There is no gas auctions in TON, it was made to avoid cheating, gas fee rise and other bad things. (reply to 19175)

zzss: Thanks (reply to 19182)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: @ton_help_bot (reply to 19190)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: It will not be possible to get the seqno of an uninitialized contract, since it is not initialized. As far as I know, it is not needed during initialization. The seqno is needed only when making an outgoing transfer. It is also worth remembering that in order to initialize the contract, there must be a sufficient number of coins at its address (reply to 19184)

zzss: So when this is done, can I send the transaction to my node, which will execute it and send it to other nodes?

Slava: it's already released. (reply to 19185)

Slava: Use seqno = 0 if your contract is not deployed yet. (reply to 19184)

Diako: Do you have example of Asynchronous smart contracts ?

Nick: Contract execution is synchronous but interaction with other contacts is asynchronous (with messages) and there isn‚Äôt any other approaches (e.g. make a synchronous call as we can you in EVM). (reply to 19230)

Howard: what is the error code 100 means?   Can't find in my Tact compiled TS file. (reply to 9358)

Behrang: It's a custom error, that is raised by the smaart contract. Check docs/source of the smart contract. (reply to 19232)

Behrang: I'm not sure about the Tact part. Maybe it's something internal to Tact.

Howard: Yes, it pop in FunC file that generated by my Tact file. Checking and try to understand what is that mean. (reply to 19233)

Egor: Are there any ton storage browsers? Is it correct that you have to somehow obtain storage address to store your files and there is no built-in browser for these addresses?

Egor: Can someone confirm or deny this? (reply to 19236)

–ù–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–π: You can use storage-daemon-cli to check bags and files stored on your machine (reply to 19236)

Egor: But what if i want to find another storage in the network?

Egor: For example, I create my storage with daemon, so how users can find me and use my storage? (reply to 19238)

–ù–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–π: https://ton.org/docs/participate/ton-storage/storage-provider (reply to 19240)

Egor: Ok, so what? Client have to know provider address (for example for this command in docs get-provider-params <address>), I want to know, is there any mechanism for sharing this address without direct contact through third party services, for example some command like get-provider-address-list which will do something like search somewhere idk or something like this. I think today the only way to do this is directly find storage providers through chats and forums (reply to 19241)

–ù–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–π: I think, there is no easy way to find all storage ADNLs. As I know, you can find addresses of providers contracts with help of explorers/indexers, because you have to report about your existence (via smc) (reply to 19242)

–ù–µ—Ç–æ–Ω–∏–π: If you want something like torrent-tracker, where you can view all shared files - do it yourself)

Egor: Oh, thanks)

Behrang: There is currently no marketplace developed. This is open for development by anyone, which will connect clients to storage providers. Currently the basic layer is developed which makes it easy for people to create a marketplace on top of it. (reply to 19240)

Egor: Thanks a lot, thats exactly what I wanted to know)

User<5745785596>: Hello does someone know the Ton address? What‚Äôs that meaning thank you üôè

Howard: tact in example https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template (reply to 19260)

Dev: Are you aiming to deploy to testnet, mainet or ton-contract-executor?

Dev: You could try this one uses toncli : https://github.com/romanovichim/TonFunClessons_Eng/blob/main/1lesson/firstlesson.md (reply to 19260)

Dev: Also take a look at the quickstart guide for toncli it has a lot of useful methods for deployment and also to run methods etc. (reply to 19260)

rub1kub üíª: How does it work?

Howard: Action Failed is annoying.... (reply to 18161)

Behrang: Currently you can point it to a TON Site, have it as a wallet address, and store some files for it.  However, as a DNS, you can store anything in DNS fields, and the software that is interpreting it is responsible for doing the "right" thing. For example you can have an "https" field on your own .ton domain, pointing to a web site, but you need a special browser which understands .ton domains, and redirects you to that web site. (reply to 19283)

Behrang: Use ton.cx explorer. It's very good for debugging. (reply to 19284)

Jangju: How do I view jettons information in tonkeeper , tonhub ?

Jangju: tx information appears, but the holding balance status cannot be found.

Jangju: Hmm.. It seems that only openmask are possible.

snejok: Hey there! I need devs advice. Can I send a screenshot from DeDust chat here? It seems to me that there is a problem with liquidity pools that is hidden.

snejok: The answer to the last question did not follow. Please could you clarify.

snejok: DeDust have a swap liquidity contract, but no one else has access to it. They claim that it is impossible to manually withdraw liquidity from it. What if they disappear then? The contract will disappear along with them with all the liquidity if you cannot use these pools just by forking.

Nick: What do you mean by forking?

Taewoo | Spacebar Ventures / HabiliAI: Is there any time deadline for the upcoming validator update?   Or does it have to be done on the exact time?

Taewoo | Spacebar Ventures / HabiliAI: Validators: we remind you that tomorrow at 13:00 UTC an network update is scheduled - you will need to update your software at that time.  Please be in touch tomorrow at 13:00 UTC, detailed instructions will be published. (forwarded from TON Status)

snejok: I mean, we have a pool where there are tokens that can be traded. According to the answers, it is clear that the pool does not belong to anyone, but only DeDust has access to it. If DeDust vanished, then tens of thousands of dollars vanished with it at the moment, and possibly hundreds in the future. By "forking" I mean, why is it not possible to use this liquidity of this pool to another dex if DeDust suddenly disappears? This pool will simply remain ownerless forever, which is absurd. (reply to 19294)

Nick: It will be possible in future, as soon as the protocol become more mature and open. Anyone will be able to integrate own platform to the pool.

snejok: Well, ok. Thank you. The situation just confused me and info was needed.

Dev: does toncli run on Apple M1 or is docker still needed?

Alex: It works w/o docker, but people are faced with problems of installing binaries and dependencies solving. Docker just helps you to exclude this part of the problem from installation.  I have both versions of toncli on M1, both works fine. (reply to 19301)

Dev: Did you have an issues with bitstring? When I run toncli start project_name I get: ImportError: cannot import name "BitString" from bitstring (/*/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/bitstring.py) (reply to 19302)

Egor: pip install bitstring==2.0.3 (reply to 19303)

Egor: Newer versions of bitstring library use different namings, but toncli tries to install the latest version, so you should downgrade it manually with this command (reply to 19304)

Dev: Yep that works. Thanks (reply to 19304)

Slava: Thank you for reporting spam messages. If you would need moderator intervention please just mention me.

Tigr: How much time on average does it take for a Core TEP to be reviewed?

Slava: That would depend on the TEP and on the current workload of the core team. (reply to 19315)

Tigr: Am I right that Core TEPs are tested on testnet before merging with mainnet?

Daniil: Sometimes TEP does not need any changes in node sources (reply to 19317)

Daniil: For example, TEP can be a format (like jetton or nft)

Tigr: Afaik core teps assume changes in code, like this one  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/88 (reply to 19318)

Daniil: Just look at some other merged teps (reply to 19320)

Tigr: There are no merged TEPs with type Core

Daniil: Oh you meant that

Daniil: Where do you see that type?

Daniil: I don't see such label or tag

Tigr: This TEP, for example https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/88

Tigr: Check out the TEP template (reply to 19325)

Daniil: Ah, I see now

Daniil: I think all major changes are tested in testnet first

Tigr: I see

Tigr: It'd be very handy to have ecrecover function embedded in TVM which is proposed in TEP88

User<5841544202>: Hi! Is there any giver for the testnet with more then 2 coins per ask? I intend to test the validation scripts, so I need to be able  validates on testnet.

Dario: Ecrecover only check signature, you can already do it using check_signature (not ecdsa, only ed25519) (reply to 19331)

&rey: Hi there! I've made a tool visualizing transactions flow: https://ratingers.pythonanywhere.com/tx-explorer/  Features: 1. Tracking multiple accounts. Just enter contract address into text field and possibly a name next to it. 2. Showing account balances. 3. Decoding known opcodes (currently jetton-related; NFT ones are not yet added). 4. Showing transactions in order as they happened, including external messages and messages from/to untracked accounts.  Known TODOs: 1. Add more opcodes to database. 2. Create button to easily add untracked peer of a message to track. 3. Loading transaction exit codes and fees.

Imposer: guys when would this PR be merged? https://github.com/Trinketer22/func_docker/pull/5

Imposer: seems like it would help a lot in using the toncli

Tigr: Implementing it way it is presented in TEP88 will allow to do things besides checking the validity of signature (reply to 19333)

User<5718323121>: what problem?

PlanL: And what is the difference between %, ~% and ^%?

Nati: You have rand() in stdlib. (reply to 19386)

Dev: is there a guarantee that bounced message will be received by the sending contract?

Dev: what effort is made to send the bounced message back to the sender when it cannot be delivered or processed?

&rey: Any successfully sent message is always delivered, this is guaranteed by message queues in shardchains. If the receiving contract failed processing of message (computation phase exit_code not 0 and not 1), and message contains enough value and was sent with bounceable flag, then the bounce message is guaranteed to be sent. (reply to 19390)

Dev: I see. And what about timeouts on messages? Always delivered within a timeframe?  Or I guess it probably determined by the existing network load and generally quite fast. (reply to 19391)

Dev: Also what is proof that a message has been sent successfully? And is that proof always available to the sending contract? (reply to 19391)

&rey: Messages are delivered in order of their creation, usually quite fast. You may be interested in chapter 2. https://ton.org/docs/tblkch.pdf (reply to 19392)

&rey: If the message was sent with mode & 2 == 0, then either the full transaction fails or this outgoing message is sent. Otherwise, there is no way to check whether message was sent (or counting balance, but that's error prone...) (reply to 19393)

Dev: Ok and record of message being sent and its mode is stored locally in the sending contracts own data? or this is just an implementation option for the sender? (reply to 19395)

PlanL: Thanks (reply to 19388)

&rey: No, nothing is stored in contract data when sending message. Your contract may save them, but the message data has no use. By the way, this allows to keep storage fees small, or transactions list could eat up the contract balance. (reply to 19396)

Daniil: This can also be useful: https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/message-delivery-guarantees (reply to 19394)

&rey: Oh, this article wasn't in place when I visited documentation last time) (reply to 19399)

Dev: I will definitely take a look. I know we want to keep the memory footprint of the contracts light. Perhaps just some meta-data can be stored about the last message sent and overwritten when transaction completes ... (reply to 19399)

Dev: "messages that were sent from one account and transactions which happened on one account are strictly ordered as well. Thanks to this, for every account we always know the order of transactions, received messages and sent messages."

Oleg: Hey guys, we have released TonUtils Reverse Proxy - alternative, fast and simple rldp-http proxy designed to host your own TON Sites!  It is simple to setup reverse proxy which allows you to run your own site in the TON network, and configure domain literally in 1 minute! Domain assigning is done by simple scanning of QR code. Just run this service, scan QR using any TON wallet app, and confirm transaction. Your site will be available on your domain.  This proxy uses completely native TON network stack implementation in golang, with high test coverage. Based on tonutils-go.  Also, to get 100% end2end encryption, I recommend to use TonUtils Proxy on the client sideüôÇ It is based on the same stack and should work perfectly.  The first site in the TON network which is based on the alternative network stack implementation is already available at http://utils.ton/ üöÄ

Step: also please  release vanity_fast for v4 address. (reply to 19417)

Moshe: Hi - I assume the TON team is already aware of this - which I am guessing is a Phishing Scam.  Please be aware.  https://tonwhales.com/explorer/address/EQDUbQFC--hBa_vP0UFMsM1lQi4sr7xNBBGxO15UX63KDq4s

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: If you are talking about a near-zero transfer with a comment about account blocking, then it is aimed at semi-literate users, and yes, this is a phishing scam. This type of phishing has always been in vogue among scammers, and nothing can be done about it. The only solution to the problem is self-education. (reply to 19420)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Greetings üëã Can anybody explain plz how are the fees for the smart contracts calculated? I see hardcoded values used to deploy smart contract in both toncli and typescript examples... Are the fees static, should't they be determined dynamically by the network instead?

Daniil: https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/fees (reply to 19444)

Daniil: sometimes it's easier to just set a fixed fee that will surely cover everything. the remaining value will just return back to your wallet (reply to 19444)

Steve: If you coded so

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Thanks, that's what I was looking for! Also found one interesting moment: Storage Fee: 4.036608 TON (1.00 MB for 365 days) I thought that the fee is payed when deploying a contract (with corresponding storage amount). Will it be charged every year from the same wallet the contract was deployed with? (reply to 19446)

User<5277567113>: I want to create NFTs give me step by step pls

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Ok I got it Storage fees are collected from the smart contract balance at the Storage phase of any transaction.

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: So the storage fee is charged from any wallet interacting with the contract, not the original one from which it was deployed, correct?

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: This is interesting how smart contract balance is maintained...

&rey: Not even so. The storage fee is charged from the contract which is processing the message. (reply to 19451)

&rey: You may wish to read abount actor model for contracts in TON - the only interaction method is sending message to other contract. Description is located somewhere in docs. (reply to 19452)

&rey: The fee is taken at transactions == when contract receives a message. (reply to 19448)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Hmm the only useful doc page I found is this one: https://ton.org/docs/develop/howto/step-by-step

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: So the contract balance should be maintained somehow...

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Say I'm developing a kind of forum, so the smart contract shoul then explicitly withdraw the fee for storing a post data from user's wallet making the post it seems...

Alex: What for you want use blockchain for your forum? Maybe these thoughts from original whitepaper(https://ton.org/docs/ton.pdf 2.9.13) will be useful for you. (reply to 19461)

Diako: empty#_ b:bits = Snake ~0;  could you please explain what  ~ and Snake do ?

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: The messages of the forum would fit 1024 bits just fine. It's more of a Twitter than Facebook. And the user should pay for the posts in the original design. As for the reason to use blockchain it's simple: in order to avoid restricting resource in some countries and for user privacy/security. (reply to 19462)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: I guess I should learn how NFTs are implemented, as the post would be some kind of paid token as well...

Alex: Your reasons, I think, will be covered by Ton Sites with proxy for your service and Ton auth through wallet for users. Example with facebook and twitter same in one general part - too expensive and useless support "posts" in TON's native blockchain messages. (reply to 19464)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Thanks, that makes sense. But there's no documentation on creating Ton Sites just yet, correct? (reply to 19466)

Daniil: https://ton.org/docs/participate/web3/sites-and-proxy (reply to 19467)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: I wonder how the storage issue is different for the Ton Sites though.

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Ok I'll study this first, thanks!

Oleg: New version of TON golang library üíé tonutils v1.5.0 has been released!  Very big update, full network stack was implemented: ADNL UDP, RLDP, DHT (client), RLDP-HTTP. You can create your own TON native services and sites. The code is covered by unit and integration tests, has benchmarks with performance tests + leaks monitoring.  Also, caching of CurrentMasterchainInfo was improved, now when you using sticky context, you will get less errors like 'block not applied' from TON nodes, when working with multiple of them in parallel.  Two cool projects already powered by tonutils' network stack: TonUtils Proxy and TonUtils Reverse Proxy, alternatives to rldp-http-proxy with user-friendly setup. Using them you can access and run your own sites in the TON network.  Changelog: 1. ADNL UDP Protocol client/server implementation 2. RLDP Protocol client/server implementation 3. RLDP-HTTP Protocol client/server implementation 4. DHT Protocol client implementation 5. TL Struct Parser + Serializer 6. DNS Set record payloads 7. Sticky CurrentMasterchainInfo (cache block based on the node id)  üöÄ https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go

User<1179794801>: Hello, I am new here, greetings from Italy

User<1179794801>: I have got a few question being  a developer but noob about this kind of software creation. At first: can I use c# someway for building apps and web apps with TON blockchain?

‚Ä¢: where can i see new products

Howard: is it possible to build an in-app Dapp?

Silvio: Yes, check @TonSwapOfficialBot (reply to 19563)

Howard: I think this example is outdated. It can't execute https://ton-community.github.io/ton/

Daniil: I just checked it few days ago and it worked fine (reply to 19565)

Daniil: What error do you get?

Liam: let's get you in the TON dApp Working Group (reply to 19563)

Behrang: I think you can create the client side of any app and dApp with C#, but for smart contracts, currently FunC is your best option. (reply to 19559)

MohammadŒ£: Why is it not in the trust wallet on its own blockchain?

Howard: do you have the group for TonCenter API? (reply to 19566)

Howard: why will still got "      error: 'API key does not exist.',"

Howard: Hi I got this error since I copy the mnemonics from TonHub(Testnet version, Sanbox)

Howard: Got this error, seems not the Private Key (the Wallet Address I have) issued, or API issued. Here is my code: (reply to 19583)

Howard: For the init code I want to deploy for smart contract, is the code I generated in Tact language folder.

Howard: I am guessing that, the external message means here were the data I send with the Txs? (reply to 19583)

Howard: OK, just fixed. Seems need to give body or bounce in fileds.

Howard: if you are using "https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC"   and by the way, make sure your mnemonics is correct. By using the library     let kk = await mnemonicValidate(mnemonics); you can get a true or false message to verify.    And double check the wallet address you got is exactly the same as your Wallet address or not!

Howard: Anyone can give the example for the usage for series of API over here?  - I want to track the specific address with the "Specific Txs Message" (Let's say method code: 0xd947b7c) Which API should I use?  (aka, then I can have a notification system to track and give notify to my users)

Howard: is TonHub wallet address is the same as V4r2 type of wallet address on TonKeeper?

Dario: ~dump();

Dev: what are the types of testing that can be done on a smart contract in the ton-contract-executor?   And what are its limitations?

Tim: You want to use emulator, it's newer and has more functions. But basically you can check what messages will be sent from contract (reply to 19624)

Dev: Ok, well let me repeat the question then for emulator.  What type of tests can be run and what are its limitations? Also for the test themselves are those typically typescript? (reply to 19625)

Tim: I've described basic outline. You make message and check what it will do to contract state. You can check examples in getgems contracts repository.  Emulator will do the same and a little bit more.

Party: The size of the archive node is greater than 2 TB. If you don't need an archive node, then don't store the entire block history.

kirito: how big without history? dose ton have the same prblem as eth? https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-has-exceeded-1tb-and-yes-its-an-issue-2b650b5f4f62 (reply to 19663)

Steve: it jus just required for historical data, if you want have all transactions and you usually don't need much

Steve: state itself is not that big

kirito: Ethereum world state consists of account nonces and balances, contract code and storageÔºåIf the state size grows infinitelyÔºå eth have no future„ÄÇ How TON can solve this problemÔºü

T: Then where do transactions go after sending, but before being added into a block? Correct me if I'm wrong, but there must be some sort of temporary storage where transactions wait to be included in a block by validators. While there might not be a global mempool, there should at least be one for each work or shard blockchain, I assume. After all, how do validators agree on which blocks to include, if they don't have a picture of all the possible transactions which could've gone into a block?   Sorry if these are dumb questions, but I'm still reading my way through the white paper. :) My main concern is the testnet transaction I sent through TON Center API - why did it never get confirmed, unlike the dozens of transactions I've sent prior? Are there some additional checks my code needs to make and potentially resend the transaction or something similar? I've followed the examples provided in the documentation and didn't notice anything alike. In all examples you shoot and wait for the confirmation, no extra logic to handle cases like mine.  Thank you for your help! (reply to 19661)

Daniil: in TON everybody pays for their storage consumption. if this problem will ever become serious, validators can just increase the storage fees (reply to 19667)

kirito: Is the payment one-time or ongoing? (reply to 19669)

Daniil: external messages are processed by validators. some validator can just ignore your message if something happens and he won't be punished for doing that. external messages have no guarantee of being delivered (reply to 19668)

Daniil: it's like memory*time=storage_fee. you pay it on every transaction, and it's usually VERY small. gas fees consume much more (reply to 19670)

TON technical overview: Besides, storage shards the same way as computation, thus if state become too large for one node to store, it will be expedient to increase number of shards in such a way that part of the state each node need to store will become small enough.

kirito: For example, if I buy some ton and put it in my wallet, it will always take up storage, and I don't think I paid anything. Or I generate some data on other contracts, I think I will only pay when running the contract. Data will exist forever, and the more contracts there are, the more data there will be.

Daniil: you pay on each transaction (reply to 19674)

Daniil: This will help you: https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/fees#storage-fee (reply to 19674)

kirito: How can a node validate a block if there is no complete state? (reply to 19673)

Daniil: TON is shardable. each validator only need to store and process the messages within his shard (reply to 19678)

TON technical overview: Validators validate blocks of distinct shards. Thus they need only data of this shard. (reply to 19678)

T: So there's no guarantee the transaction will get delivered? I guess the best option in this case is to re-broadcast it every X seconds or a minute then? Would be nice to include this in the docs, because I think it's a pretty important point, especially when you need to process transactions in a queue, like you do with seqno-wallets, an ignored transaction can brick your entire system, if not handled appropriately. (reply to 19671)

Daniil: yes, you just should resend it. trying like every 15-20 seconds should be fine. (reply to 19681)

T: Got it. Thank you for your help! (reply to 19682)

kirito: Can I think that ton will not encounter eth problems? Especially as mentioned in this article, the number of working nodes is getting smaller and smaller„ÄÇhttps://medium.com/hackernoon/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-has-exceeded-1tb-and-yes-its-an-issue-2b650b5f4f62

Daniil: in PoS blockchains, the number of working nodes is getting only higher and higher usually (reply to 19684)

Daniil: because it's pretty profitable to maintain a validator node

Daniil: also note that this article is old (2018), and eth is PoS now too (reply to 19684)

kirito: The above article mentioned that there will be fewer and fewer nodes that can work on eth in the future, and most nodes can only forward messages, but cannot verify them. Because the "world state" is getting more and more, the cost of verification is getting higher and higher„ÄÇEven though eth has become poS. He still faces this problem? (reply to 19687)

kirito: In fact, I don't care about eth, as long as ton doesn't have this kind of problem, I will be very optimistic about it.

Daniil: ton doesn't have this kind of problem. (reply to 19689)

kirito: short eth üôà

Simon: hi, how about adding sections to the group.  General, flood, jobs etc. Just in the Russian chat, this person (@f_closer) distributes mutes and bans to everyone.

Alex: I've done deployment script via ton library for tact-wallet and it works, but I'm not sure my way to get pk as Bigint really fine. Could somebody check and advice best practice for TS in this case?

Steve: This is a little bit tricky, but i am just writing 256 bit uint to cell and then read 32 byte buffer from it and vise versa (reply to 19714)

Alex: I understood general idea, but could you give me an example of code or link relates to my case?üôè (reply to 19715)

shahar: /build_tonlib

T: Not sure if this helps clear things up, but I managed to log the API request & response relating to this issue. API doesn't give any indication that there is something wrong with the transaction. (reply to 19703)

&rey: Have you tried using other API provider? For example, if you're using toncenter.com now, you could try tonapi.io. Or the other way round. Or, you could start lite client in toncli and try to send the BOC from there. (reply to 19721)

T: Haven't tried that, thank you for the suggestion. I'll give that a shot

T: Ok `tonapi.io` does return an error. I'm just not sure what it means (reply to 19722)

&rey: This means transaction is outdated, you have to create new one with later expiration time. (reply to 19724)

T: Hmm but it was generated only seconds before I submitted it through the API. How long is the expiration? And does it matter that my service already submitted this boc through toncenter API before I tried sending it manually? (reply to 19725)

Daniil: Maybe your computer time is wrong (reply to 19726)

T: Oh, you may be right. Looks like the server i was testing on is almost 1min behind. That's why I never encountered this issue on my local machine. Didn't expect the time to have anything to do with this. Nice catch. I'll sync the time and see if that changes anything (reply to 19727)

T: Yep, looks like that was the issue! The moment I synced the clock, transaction went through. Lesson learned - correct time is important to be able to send transactions. Thank you a lot for your help and patience @Gusarich and @pcrafter !!

&rey: For just browsing .ton network you don't really need a special browser, setting proxy to in1.ton.org does work. For safe and reliable browsing you may install proxy on your own computer. (reply to 19768)

Howard: any know exitCode: -14?

Behrang: I meant that someone could potentially create this imaginary browser or maybe someone can create a browser extension that can add such functionality.   My point was that DNS is a service and it cann have many different uses. But currently there is no https field to do what you asked. (reply to 19768)

Behrang: My friend, you are asking the first question that comes to your mind in this group.

Slava: The qrcode is a popular library that works OK. It's 24 KB uncompressed.  However, the state init could be very big and I'm not sure that's using QR codes is a good fit for this. (reply to 19835)

Slava: You can always use code splitting and dynamic imports to load the code that is not needed immediately. But this is a separate subject. (reply to 19836)

&rey: Yes, I'm using it and have met the problem that everything doesn't fit into QR code, and that's why I initially asked. (reply to 19847)

Slava: As @steve_kite said, maybe we need some URL shortening service for TON. (reply to 19849)

Behrang: Featured pools are not yet active, and they are looking for nominators to join them, so that they can become an active validator. They are highlighted there, to encourage new nominators to consider them.  Nominator pools are the list of all active and inactive pools. (reply to 19845)

Dario: the ton-compiler error or impossible to add such lib

Dario: i only need Gram,  which is defined in TonUtil.fif, and ton-compiler gives me error (reply to 19862)

Dario: yes, but i need Gram, (reply to 19867)

&rey: Well, I see definition of Gram, as well. Have you included TonUtil.fif in your file? If it still doesn't work, you could try to add instruction definition to your main.fif: { -1 { 1+ 2dup 8 * ufits } until   rot over 4 u, -rot 8 * u, } : Gram, (reply to 19869)

Dario: as I wrote above, the problem is that ton-compiler doesnt include it and compilation fails (reply to 19870)

Dario: im adding definition manually but the code wont be so readable

&rey: "TonUtil.fif" include (reply to 19871)

Dario: No, this works only to output. The problem is that toncompiler runs fift for checking and doesn't output anything if it fails (reply to 19873)

Nirmal: Hello all, I m looking for blockchain developer who can write smart contract

Dario: Hi, @f_closer can you please check pm?

&rey: Bored of using command line to deploy your contract, having to fix and reinstall toncli on every update, etc, etc? Here's a solution ‚Äî page for deploying contracts! https://ratingers.pythonanywhere.com/deployer/ If you have code BOC and data BOC, you can enter them into fields and get QR for contract deployment, that can be scanned with Tonkeeper.

&rey: For example, you may type in code and data of TON DNS contract (https://tonscan.org/address/EQC3dNlesgVD8YbAazcauIrXBPfiVhMMr5YYk2in0Mtsz0Bz#source), and my tool will produce the same address as actual contract is.

Daniil: Why didn't you host it on GitHub pages? Does your application require backend? (reply to 19896)

&rey: No backend is used (except shortening links, that depends on external message), I'm just considering to make it accessible as TON Site. (reply to 19898)

Tim: short links on front too

&rey: They need to be stored somewhere for Tonkeeper to access them, so there's no way to work around this dependency) (reply to 19900)

Dev: well I'm on a Mac M1.  I have python 3.9 and installed via pip3 install toncli - what else needs to be done?  func, fift etc I have compiled from source and point to those (reply to 19911)

Step: i think you need to include address_helpers.func in your test contracts or  address_helpers.func may be missing from your test-libs folder. (reply to 19912)

Daniil: - it's English chat  - it's dev chat (reply to 19904)

Dev: all I am seeing concerning config of toncli in the documentation is:  " Configuration Config folder will create on first deploy, all fift / func libs will copy to it, also deploy wallet contract will be created. "   Does this mean that toncli is not fully configured until it does a deployment? and that's why run_tests does not have access to address_helpers.func ?

Dev: what are the steps to get toncli properly configured?

Dev: what config folder are you referring to?  I don't see documentation of a config folder only its mentioned that a config will be created upon first deployment (reply to 19911)

Dev: Still see error after:  toncli update_libs INFO: Succesfully copied fift-libs func-libs test-libs from /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/toncli/lib to /Users/apple/Library/Application Support/toncli

(reply to 19974)

&rey: I think your team must consist of at least three people.  One person must know and design full architecture of your system: backends, frontend, their interaction with contracts and messages between contracts themselves. He must know TON contracts, cells and messages model and be able to predict unusual transaction chains that can be used for hacking sometimes.  The second person must know FunC enough to develop the contracts. I think he must know how to optimize contracts, especially how to create less cells onchain. Knowledge of CI tools for TON is a must. I think Fift isn't that necessary for development though it can be useful for forming static data of contract.  The third person would design frontend pages. He must know how to handle all error cases, including info providers not responding and transactions failing. He needs HTML, JS, CSS in his work and must know CI tools and version control systems as well.  (Post not generated by ChatGPT üôÇ) (reply to 19986)

gnoblin: what hacking cases do you mean? thanks (reply to 19987)

&rey: For example, if there is a long transactions chain, user can initiate two of them simultaneously, and that could lead to unpredictable results in some cases. Or, if your contract reserves money by sending TON to itself, user can send two messages so at the moment of processing the second there won't be any coins on contract balance. See TON Hack Challenge 1 for more information. (reply to 19988)

Mahdi: Thanks. How much a team like this will cost? (reply to 19987)

&rey: I think that's not a development question. But my estimate is $1200-$2000 total from start up to project public launch. (reply to 19990)

If conference ever needs to be sharded, that can be done with NFT addresses üòÑ So that people in one shard could communicate directly with seeing each other's video, and people from other shards would receive only one video stream ‚Äî featured by shard validator moderator; cross-shard communication would be through text messages then.

Max: Hey guys!

Max: @ton-community/tx-emulator has been rebranded into @ton-community/sandbox and significantly improved!  It now uses the new ton-core under the hood and is compatible with all the APIs that it provides, making the creation of smart contract wrappers easier than ever!  More importantly though, the blockchain-experimental features have been merged, so you can now emulate whole chains of transactions and even emulate interactions with existing smart contracts from real networks (both mainnet and testnet)!  Together with it we released another package, test-utils, which, along with the new features  of sandbox, significantly simplifies testing of systems of multiple smart contracts.  Check out the examples provided together with sandbox to see the intended way to use it.  Please note that this tool is still in beta, but we would love to hear any feedback from you!  Also, stay tuned for more detailed tutorials for using this tool! (forwarded from TonTech)

Howard: Wow. Is this Tact language we coded in the smart contract also can use this? (reply to 20082)

Narek: It‚Äôs language agnostic (reply to 20083)

Hello, world: guys, how to deposit to my wallet in openmask 1 TON, with testnet

gnoblin: didn‚Äôt know that, thanks (reply to 20161)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: In this chat, investment issues are not discussed. (reply to 20164)

gnoblin: sure, but being a validator is pretty related to tech part imho (reply to 20165)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: From a technical point of view, the bet size of one validator depends on the bet size of other validators. If 100 validators are betting ~300k coins, then a validator with 10k coins will not be able to become a validator, since the average level of all stakes will be about 300k. The reward scheme, where the reward depends on the amount of the bet, pushes all validators to increase the bet. (reply to 20166)

T: Hi there! I'm trying to send a transaction using js ton library, but the transaction isn't going through. Manually trying to send the boc via tonapi.io resulted in the following error. What does "failed to unpack account state" mean? / Is there some documentation available with an explanation of each error message, so I don't have to bother you guys every time? Thank you!

gnoblin: What are you sending and where to? Are you able to share the code? Thanks (reply to 20184)

T: I'm sending 0.1 TON between two V4 wallets. The source wallet has a balance of ~0.8 TON. This is on testnet. Will share the code, one sec

T: This is the gist of it. I ensure that seqno is correctly assigned and never reused. `withdrawal.amountCoins = 100_000_000`. Have been able to send many withdrawals before, only ran into this after a small refactor, but nothing really changed in the withdrawal code.

T: I can also share the boc, if that helps

T: Here is a bit more context on how withdrawals are sent out

gnoblin: Is the old version working? (reply to 20187)

T: Just tried reverting and yes, it does work. I'll look through the diff and see if I can spot anything. Still interested to know what the error implies tho

Behrang: I think that your wallet is not deployed. The wallet that you're transferring from it. Can you share the address of it?

T: Wallet is definitely deployed - I've sent many deposits and withdrawals to/from it. Address is kQBUfJ41_-cSEfF1q0vsFX9wZG2-t4zRNLYzrgb1kHftRywP (reply to 20192)

Slava: Make sure that your private key and the seqno are correct.

Slava: Also try calculating the address and compare it with the deployed one.

Behrang: Yes, it's deployed on testnet. And you are using the testnet right? not mainnet by mistake? (reply to 20193)

T: I can't find any obvious changes which could've affected sending of withdrawals. The only changes were 1) the `sendWithdrawal()` function was moved into a separate class (it's identical as before), and 2) initialization code in `onApplicationBootstrap()` was moved into the new class as well, only the last line was changed (`this.onBootstrapListeners.forEach((v) => v());` - previously was `this.runCronJobs = true;`).  Code in the screenshots is the only code which could have affected this. The withdrawal database record was created by the broken code, so was the seqno. After reverting to the working code, the same database record was sent out successfully - same seqno and all. Private key is also the same - initialization code stayed the same (only moved to a new class) and so did the mnemonic in the config.  I'm also 100% using testnet - that's configured in the .env file which didn't change during the refactor.

T: Calculate it how? With the library? The address I shared was the result of walletContract.address.toString({ testOnly: true, urlSafe: true }); (reply to 20195)

gnoblin: It‚Äôs redo fixes again from scratch (based on previous working version) :)) (reply to 20197)

T: Same code in the working version ü§î

T: Yeah, I guess so. What about the error message tho? What does it imply? That might help me look for the issue in the right place (reply to 20202)

Slava: Yes, with the library. Using the same private key. (reply to 20200)

Slava: Try reverting the changes and apply them again bit by bit checking the results. The "binary search" strategy is a good one for such things. (reply to 20199)

Alireza: Hi there,  Regarding the periodic maintenance and database grooming of validator node, the document says:  "... the validator process must be stopped before performing the steps ..."  As I've understood, if we stop the process, the validator cannot perform its job and could be punished due to this disruption. So, I think we need to:  1- pull the server out of the active validatores (need to wait hours for getting deactivated). 2- do the operation. 3- attend in the next ellection for the next validation round (again need to wait hours for getting activated).  This way, the maintenance job takes several hours to be finished, and the server will miss a validation round completely, which is not good at all.  Is there any better solution?

Vinayak Dubey: hi i am setting up a validator and i had a query like right now the funds wallet is generated and stored in the node itself is there any way to decouple the funds wallet from the validator?

Behrang: If you are worried about security of your validator wallet:  1- You can limit it to 10,000 TON, create a nominator pool, and use another wallet to send your funds in the pool. This way, your risk is limited to 10,000.  2- Yesterday I found a very interesting wallet, which allows funds to only be sent to a predesignated address. This I think will help you secure that 10,000 too. I haven't tested it myself, but you can find it here: https://github.com/EmelyanenkoK/nomination-contract/blob/master/restricted-wallet/wallet.fc (reply to 20422)

Vinayak Dubey: awesome thanks

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Hello, is there an existing contract for automatic deviding inputs to other wallets by certain rules (for example equally)? It seams simple and would useful when team work in certain project that gets TON inputs.

Daniil: I've just compared the history in tonapi explorer and other ones. Looks like tonapi shows external messages as messages from null address...

Daniil: Basically, someone sent several external messages to the contract of your username. It's okay, nothing bad can happen. (reply to 20448)

211 Capital: Can a minted asset be revoked or taken away in some way? (reply to 20449)

Steve: yeah, just copying new library and rebranding it everywhere - very friendly

Diako: Do you have any example of getting connected to my ton wallet " chrome extension " ?

211 Capital: Let's try to rephrase the question. The point is not that some transaction is shows weird messages. The essence of the problem and the question is that the transaction is spontaneously committed (!) without my participation. And it is visible in other tone explorers (reply to 20457)

Daniil: I've already explained. Those are external messages that can be sent by anybody (usually Fragment does that) (reply to 20479)

Slava: This is a new bot that forwards questions from answers.ton.org . The bot is under development, if there are suggestions or bug reports, write to me soon. Help in any way you can)

Nati: Great stuff üíé (reply to 20497)

&rey: Suggestion: let answers be forwarded back to answers.ton.org. (reply to 20497)

Dario: +  Also would be better if not all answers will be forwarded, only stuff that start with smt like  /ans ....stuff... (reply to 20499)

Slava: A good idea.  You need to make a working account of the bot, which, on command in the chat, will send the answer to the site.  Looks good, it can be implemented

Slava: If there is something important, please send me a private message

talkol: This is very difficult to do.. some of the answers span multiple chats. Won‚Äôt it create low quality content there? (reply to 20501)

talkol: How difficult is it to open TON Overflow as a TWA here inside TG so people can answer inside the website but still stay in the context of the chat

talkol: Maybe we also do auto login with your TG credentials so it‚Äôs a seamless experience

Slava: I don't know, it looks like an overkill IMO. I think it's OK to mark questions for manual review and then moderated import to the QA website, but answers should be posted on the website directly.

Slava: TWA UX is terrible right now, it has a lot of bugs and I think it would be very bad experience for any serious editorial work. For example the input cursor is not getting rendered in TWA for me, also the mouse scrolling doesn't work :)

Slava: So it would be great pain to edit any serious answers with code through TWA.

Slava: And the TWA window is also too small for this.

&rey: A possible solution is to add TON Connect auth to answers.ton.org.

Daniil: There was a Footstep for that iirc  I just remembered how someone proposed it in a chat, but didn't post in footsteps repo. (reply to 20615)

Slava: Yes, that's a great idea. We've also thought about creating an incentive for answer writers so they can receive bounties in TON coins. (reply to 20615)

&rey: Then it will be like overton.netlify.app) I remember its announcement... but somehow the project went dead. (reply to 20619)

Slava: Yeah, the idea seems cool. (reply to 20620)

Slava: If you have found a bug just post it here in a single message or create an issue on GitHub. If this is a security issue, please PM me instead and don't publish it anywhere. Otherwise please abstain from flooding in the chat. Thank you.

Slava: By the way, they suggested changing the bot's avatar to something generated by a neuronet.  If you are interested, you can send me, I will change

Behrang: I think the bot is good enough for now. Let it be like this for a few weeks. If there were lots of questions, then try to improve it. Opening the link and responding may not be that hard. Currently I think the problem is that people aren't asking questions there.

A: Got tons of tons! Thanks! (reply to 20415)

gnoblin: –ö (reply to 20812)

Dappman: Former Eth dev here looking for a quick start on TON dev that will get me up to speed on what I need to know to create an NFT store.  Can someone drop a link?  Also, does the TON blockchain have native support for NFT/asset ownership, so I can do everything I need purely from a client side browser dApp, or will I need to create a smart contract to handle that?   Finally, what is the equivalent of Metamask for TON, a Chrome extension wallet that I can pop up to allow the user to make payments?  Is there a favorite NPM module for interacting with it, either server or client side?

Dappman: One more Q.  TestNet faucet link?

Eugene: @testgiver_ton_bot (reply to 20815)

Dappman: thx.  Best wallet to use for app dev?  Chrome extension? (reply to 20816)

talkol: Hey everybody!  DoraHacks is starting on Monday and we worked hard to create a new set of onboarding tutorials for new TON developers!  https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials  We will appreciate if you can experiment with the tutorials on Sunday and report issues on anything you see isn‚Äôt clear or not working.

Dappman: That's what I needed.  Thanks.üëç (reply to 20818)

elephan: Excellent.

gnoblin: is there any wishlist for dorahacks prototypes? (like what Ton would like to see mvp‚Äôed) (reply to 20818)

Dappman: Do you want tutorial feedback here, or Discord, or where?

Dappman: Nevermind.  Tutorial says to submit a PR, so I assume the first step is to fork the tutorials repo.

talkol: I put a link in the message, the tutorial platform is open source, in its issues: https://github.com/ton-community/tutorials/issues (reply to 20822)

Dappman: üëç (reply to 20824)

Dappman: Still would like to know if I have to create my own smart contract to manager NFT ownership and transfers for my upcoming NFT store, or if the TON blockchain has native support through an existing platform level smart contract or lib.  Specific docs on thsi subject would be great.

Dappman: Or, if there is an existing popular NFT store that makes its smart contract available publicly so I can do the same through its smart contract, or public REST API if has one, that would work too.  Trying to avoid redo'ing existing work.

talkol: There are multiple NFT store projects that are open source, you can rely on them directly, or fork the contracts.  GetGems Disintar TON Diamonds  Look here if you just want to deploy an NFT: https://github.com/tondiamonds/ton-nft-deployer (reply to 20827)

gnoblin: I hope admin won‚Äôt ban me for saying this, but ‚Äúprepare your *nus‚Äù.  You‚Äôll need to deploy a tree of contracts for each collection. Each collection and each nft in that collection are separate contracts.  If you need to store values for each user, you‚Äôll need to shard you dictionaries.  There‚Äôre no view methods between contracts, cross contract calls are async, wallets are smart contracts too. (reply to 20826)

gnoblin: but the whole architecture has decent logic behind it and mr @talkol ‚Äôs tutorials help a lot

talkol: If you want some details of how TON contract sharding works, you can read this post - https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons  It‚Äôs about jettons (fungible tokens) but very similar thing goes on in NFT (reply to 20829)

A: My fift.exe does not understand constant operator. Have I got old version?

‚Äî 2023-01-29 ‚Äî

&rey: You haven't imported Fift.fif. Among other, it defines constant: { 1 'nop does create } : constant Many "primitives" are actually defined there. (reply to 20832)

Sean: Hey guys, I dont know if this is a right place to ask, but does anybody know what's the difference between TON COIN and TON TOKEN?

Behrang: Toncoin is the main native coin on The Open Network. Used for paying fees, staking, etc.  TON Token which is known as Jetton, is a standard for defining new tokens in The Open Network. Like ERC20 in Ethereum. Examples include tokens like USDT, USDC, DAI, DOGE, etc. (reply to 20835)

Sean: I just want to know that TON isn't a scam right?  I think that I bought TON TOKEN through Metamask, recently, I tried to transfer to Bitget exchange and they only support TON Coin instead of TON TOKEN. üòµ‚Äçüí´

Sean: I mean TON TOKEN isnt a scam right?*

Behrang: NFTs are standardized in TEP 62:  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md  Basically, you need to create a NFT Collection (using its smart contract), and use it to create a NFT Item smart contract for each item in your collection.   To sell NFTs, you have to create a marketplace smart contract.   Check out the code of reference implementation here:  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/tree/main/nft (reply to 20826)

Sean: I am worrying because I am seeing people commenting that it is not original

Behrang: This looks like a shit coin. (reply to 20839)

Sean: What do you mean... Isn't this TON TOKEN? (reply to 20842)

Sean: I guess I am fked?

Andrew: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toncoin/ this is the one and only TON Blockchain coin (reply to 20843)

User<5906393387>: Anyone, can you explain, why is there Orbs network, if we can use TON - fast and secure blockchain?  I understood, for ex. Polygon - for slow Ethereum, but TON is a high speed blockchain though.

talkol: Orbs is a layer above TON. Orbs relies on TON as base layer. Orbs is not supposed to help TON scale but to solve infrastructure problems that TON base layer doesn‚Äôt try to solve.  For example, to run a DAO governance normally votes need to look at a historic snapshot of holdings. TON contracts can only look at current state. So additional infrastructure layers add these functionalities (reply to 20871)

talkol: Oracles is another example like Chainlink. It‚Äôs also an infrastructure layer that runs on top of the L1

Ìï¥ÏÑ±: yes‚Ä¶ but i want to decode cell data that input to transaction. do i have to get structure of message? (reply to 20915)

doni: are you using toncenter ?

Ìï¥ÏÑ±: yes i use toncenter api

Ìï¥ÏÑ±: I wanted to track some non-public contract transaction. but it seems impossible

doni: toncenter provide getransaction api (reply to 20924)

doni: nothing is impossible :)

Behrang: Can anyone please tell me the usage of accept_message() in recv_internal?  I saw it for the first time here:  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool/blob/main/func/pool.fc#L468

Ìï¥ÏÑ±: yes. but can i parse custom contract‚Äôs input without  tlb scheme?  for example, with evm, i can parse tx input some uint256, address, slice, ... without ABI. but I cant parse TVM tx input without tlb scheme... (reply to 20928)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: If you do not know the data structure, then you will not be able to parse this data. In any case, you first need to find out what scheme you need to parse the data. You can guess, of course, but in the end, nothing sensible will come of it. Conventionally, we have 32 bytes in front of us. Without knowing the scheme of this data, we do not know what is in front of us - one key 256 bits long, or two int128, or what else. (reply to 20930)

Behrang: I understand it for external messages. What I don't is that in this case it is only inside a specific branch of recv_internal, and I have never saw it in recv_internal on other smart contracts. (reply to 20936)

User<5725247011>: Do you know does it has some limitations? For example, 50 req per sec (reply to 20947)

&rey: By default, only incoming message value is used for internal messages processing, and if it's not sufficient, contract doesn't spend its own balance trying to process a request. (reply to 20950)

Behrang: Great, makes sence. Thanks üëç

Kon: Just use cache... There is something like 60 per seconds, 3600 per minute, etc. You can find all in their documentation... (reply to 20951)

Howard: Hi, for NFT Item Code:  there is a field called init? in get_nft_data() ge method, is this field should be always keep 0, or only before minting set with 0, and after it getting own by a wallt address, should change to 1? (reply to 20932)

Howard: If anyone knows how to debug in TonKeeper, please let know!  I am testing and try to find where the ExitCode 9 Coming from on Mobile, got the error code copy like this. (reply to 20968)

&rey: At the moment of minting, NFT only contains init?, index and collection_address in its storage, with init? set to zero. Upon receiving message from collection it loads all the remaining parameters and sets init? to one. This is needed to make NFT addresses independent of their content. (reply to 20968)

&rey: You can try resolving the same domain (as far as I see, this is about TON DNS) via TonWeb. (reply to 20969)

Howard: seems not this issued, will navigate more and find other possibilities (reply to 20972)

Ìï¥ÏÑ±: Hi, when I send an internal message to contract A -(msg 1)-> contract B -(msg 2)-> contract C -(msg 3)-> contract D, if msg 3 being processed in contract D throws an exception, all are the msg processing (msg 1, msg2, msg3) reverted or only msg 3 reverted and msg 1,2 executed?

Alex: Only processing of msg 3 will be failed, 1,2 excuted. (reply to 20985)

Ìï¥ÏÑ±: thank you! (reply to 20986)

Ìï¥ÏÑ±: one more question, then how can make dex aggregator in ton‚Ä¶? (reply to 20986)

Alex: Developer have to handle all this cases in contracts logic. So, when something going wrong, for example, Contract D should send "notification" message, say, to contract A. But it means, we need to know, what could be wrong, of course. (reply to 20988)

&rey: Acquire everything by your contracts (which probably would not fail) then do all outgoing actions. (reply to 20988)

&rey: That's where formal description and verification is needed) I've recently posted such a footstep so I think someone could take it. (reply to 20989)

Petr üá∑üá∫: Hi there! Can I create custom wallet contract compatible with tonkeeper?

Petr üá∑üá∫: For example same as default wallet contract, but withdraw nft and ton can be only to specific wallet but don't to another any addresses

DamX: Hi guys

DamX: Who created func language ? ü§î   Just curious (reply to 20999)

&rey: I think you'll need to fork Tonkeeper and add your code + data format, and I believe that's not too hard. (reply to 20997)

&rey: Maybe, Telegram team who have been designing TON a few years ago? (reply to 21000)

Petr üá∑üá∫: No, tonkeeper must be standard, only wallet contract is customized (reply to 21001)

&rey: That probably wouldn't work, because Tonkeeper would not sign transaction unless it confirms that there is enough funds on the wallet, and it doesn't support customized contracts as far as I know. (reply to 21003)

Petr üá∑üá∫: But I make stayed base logic, just customize withdrawing funds in wallet contract. How tonkeeper checks and found differences? (reply to 21005)

&rey: Tonkeeper stores your seed phrase. Then, on startup (something could be cached, though), app converts it into public key, creates a contract InitState BOC and hashes it to get contract address. (reply to 21007)

F: @fourchet was banned for malicious misinformation

Petr üá∑üá∫: One another question, how I can get mnemonic of mounted contract?

Petr üá∑üá∫: Or how I can mount a contract with specific mnemonic?

doni: i think you ment   how can you restrict a role in a smart contract   so two best practices   add an owner address to contract storage  and restrict some actions in to contract to messages coming from this owner (reply to 21031)

doni: also you can public key instead  and verify a message signed by a certain key

talkol: Holy sh*t! Did you see you can run getters in https://verifier.ton.org ?  What is TON Verifier?  verifier.ton.org is a due diligence tool that everyone should use before touching a TON contract. You can see the source code + proof it matches what's on-chain.  Why Getters?  Let's say the contract has an admin role. Has it been revoked? Now you can run the getter and see who the admin is!  Integration in any explorer  The verifier has an SDK in ton-community github that allows all explorers embed it and also get the getters functionality.

talkol: Contract writers, please verify your sources!

Chak: Is it possible to use in testnet? (reply to 21036)

&rey: > Now you can run the getter and see who the admin is! *unless get-method returns untrue values, in which cases contract code has to be fully checked. (reply to 21036)

Daniil: you can store it like:  cell new_data = begin_cell().store_dict(my_dict).end_cell(); set_data(new_data); (reply to 21055)

Daniil: why do you need dictionary by the way? if you want to have something like user => balance map that will store data of all your users, it will lead to large gas consumption

Behrang: Isn't it renamed to blueprint?  https://github.com/ton-community/blueprint (reply to 21045)

Tim: It is (reply to 21080)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Hi here, I'm writing tonlib wrapper for c#/.net, and need some help to understand tonlib <-> liteserver communication "scenario":  When I send getAccountState (for example) - I got couple of updateSyncState before getting actual fullAccountState response. Ok.  In this "updateSyncState" responses I see "sync_state":{"@type":"syncStateInProgress","from_seqno":27005885,"to_seqno":27007091,"current_seqno":27007091} - so it's syncing to 27007091.  But when I couple of seconds later send one more "getAccountState" (even for same account) - I see that it's syncing again, "from_seqno":27005885,"to_seqno":27007091,"current_seqno":27007091!  Why it's syncing again from 27005885 (not from 27007091 it synced couple of seconds earlier)?

Tim: Checkout tonutils-go and it's author, he has some guides about ton architecture. Also it would probably be better to write adnl client instead of tonlib wrapper (reply to 21082)

Andrey: tonlib wrapper actualy more secure due block validation proofs (reply to 21083)

Andrey: you can call every ~5 seconds `sync = ton.BlockIdExt;` function to get actual state and not get out of sync (reply to 21082)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Seems not helping. For every "sync" request I get at least 3 responses : updateSyncState+syncStateInProgress, updateSyncState+syncStateDone, ton.blockIdExt, with identical from_seqno and to_seqno (reply to 21085)

Andrey: becouse 27005885 is key-block, seems all fine

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: but why it syncing to 27007820 (for example) several times in a row? It's OK for me that it's syncing to every _new_ block (27007818, 27007819, 27007820) when it appears, but it syncs to same block again and again too. (reply to 21087)

Andrey: becouse 27007820 is last masterchain block at the moment of call (reply to 21088)

Andrey: you syncing blocks from keyblock to current last masterchain block

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: but it did this second earlier. in previous sync call

Andrey: how much time takes this process?

Andrey: more than a second?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: A little more. I have 1sec interval between every sync request, and every response takes a little.

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: If i replace sync with getAccountState - it does the same: every time syncStateInProgress, then syncStateDone, then fullAccountState. And again - syncStateInProgress repeats for same to_seqno as second earlier.

Andrey: its normal behaivour

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: ok, thanks. it was strange to me that its re-syncing the same block again

Behrang: Awesome. Is there any easy way to pass address as slice to get methods? For example for get_wallet_address(slice) method. (reply to 21036)

Alex: For ton js library Address.parse(‚ÄòEQA1PG5ByuhEWf1bzRl7957lRZiTHBFHaja-9vbrF8gmRW6P‚Äô) helps get Address object from Address string. Or what do you mean by ‚Äòto pass‚Äô? (reply to 21098)

Behrang: I mean, if I want to find my jetton wallet address, I have to send my own wallet address to get_wallet_address as a parameter on this page where I can run get methods. However, when I paste my address, it shows me an error:  Error: Unknown magic prefix  Looks like it expects a slice, but I don't know how to convert my user friendly address or hex address into a slice to use on this page.

You can see the contract type to be "NFT".  Also, by using the lite-client and printing out the content of the multisig wallet using getaccount there is no reference to the NFT.  Do you know what I'm doing wrong?

User<554673663>: Hey folks Grafana dashboard not working https://tonmon.xyz/?orgId=1&refresh=5m

&rey: I can't find the description though I've read it, probably it is shown while verifying contract. In short: ‚Äî TON validators execute your contract bytecode. They are responsible for correct execution but they don't know code from which the contract was generated. They are designed for highload and are doing the one thing ‚Äî generating TON transactions; ‚Äî Orbs validators, among other things, can check whether onchain code matches one provided by users. If I remember correctly, they have significantly lower stakes. (reply to 21256)

talkol: true, verifying the source code matches is also somethign you can do yourself in your browser so it's much less dangrous (reply to 21258)

talkol: the verify manually button, takes all the sources from IPFS to your browser, and compiles them using WASM and makes sure the bytecode matches the on-chain

talkol: so if you're really paranoid and don't trust anyone, you can do that and have peace of mind

talkol: also, the list of source code verifiers is open and any community verifier is welcome to join - the system is described here: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/91  Orbs validators are doing this as volunteer work as a community service, they don't make any money from this :)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): What does "dns_storage_address#7473 bag_id:uint256 = DNSRecord;" mean? from No Name  Have seen this: https://ton.org/docs/participate/ton-storage/storage-faq#how-to-host-static-ton-site-in-ton-storage-low-level  > dnsstorageaddress#7473 bagid:uint256 = DNSRecord;  Looks like need to assign bagid to the sha256 of "site" ("site"H) DNS record?

Krugo D: How does FunC compare to more wider adopted languages such as Solidity? Is there a reason why TON has chosen a proprietary language over something more battletested and widely known?

Andrew: FunC is built as a high-level language over Fift, which is proprietary because TON has it's own VM, called TVM (reply to 21294)

Daniil: Func is actually low level. If Fift is assembly, then Func is like C (reply to 21295)

Daniil: High-level language for ton is currently Tact

Andrew: well right now it is (reply to 21297)

Andrew: I'm talking more about hierarchy: Fift - FunC - Tact

Victor: But Fift is not really assembly and FunC in theory could compile directly into the TVM code. Like solidity does with EVM. (reply to 21296)

Daniil: It was just an analogy (reply to 21300)

Whitey: Hi there! Can I shedule a task for executing each hour, e.g. 1:00, 2:00 ... And in execution process get all transaction information of last hour exactly?

Nikitka: use crontab to schedule your task and tonapi.io to fetch the data (reply to 21303)

Whitey: It's impossible make this processes on chain? (reply to 21304)

Nikitka: why do you need to make it on chain (reply to 21305)

Whitey: Maybe exist some instrument for repeated task by time? In ton blockchain (reply to 21306)

Nikitka: you can send a transaction to your contract every hour

Whitey: I know another way - if some transaction happen - check the time. But in this case, needed many transaction each minute

Whitey: Can I get last hour income fund transaction from the contract code?

Nikitka: assume you need to store each transaction in the contract data, but it could be gas consuming

Whitey: Is it fit, if I send read (free) transactions to the contract? (reply to 21308)

Whitey: But I can get this data from tonapi.io for free? Or I need paying for ability to parse this information? (reply to 21311)

Brian: Buenas me quiero iniciar en esto como lo hago ?

&rey: Yes. You can save old balance and after an hour calculate the difference to get income. (reply to 21310)

Whitey: I need to get not amount, but detailed statistic - who, amount, time - about each transactions in last hour (reply to 21315)

&rey: Income is always associated with message so this will calculate everything exactly hourly. (reply to 21315)

&rey: Well, then you need offchain processing. (reply to 21316)

Whitey: Ton blockchain doesn't have scheduling system? (reply to 21318)

&rey: Otherwise, I could use your contract for storing unlimted amount of data. (reply to 21318)

Whitey: Is it expensive? (reply to 21320)

&rey: Builtin -- no. I am developing one, but there are several problems. (reply to 21319)

&rey: Yes, this is pricey. I can store 1 GB, for example. (reply to 21321)

Whitey: Is it possible - remove last data for make it cheaper? (reply to 21323)

&rey: Yes, tonapi.io is free, or you can launch own lite server. (reply to 21313)

Whitey: How much worth to store 100 megabytes for example? (reply to 21323)

Whitey: If I launch off chain - this is not fairly, I can rule of my own server. Otherwise - my server can lay down, and all system will stop

Whitey: I wanted make all processes on-chain...

Whitey: Schedule system absent in the ton blockchain?

&rey: 400 TON/year https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/fees#calculator-example (reply to 21326)

Whitey: But saving every turn it's a small text information... (reply to 21330)

Whitey: Can you help me with scheduling system on-chain like off-chain cron?

&rey: By "sending read-only transactions" (those are called get-methods) you can't change blockchain state. Blockchain doesn't even know whether you have ran some code. (reply to 21312)

&rey: I'd rather wish TON Foundation to approve my footstep https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/71, after which moment the timer would be available for everyone. (after it's done, of course) (reply to 21332)

&rey: Why do you need many transactions? I think you can safely postpone all processing to time when next message arrives (just do processing first and then put new message into queue). (reply to 21309)

Whitey: Does it mean that full on-chain informational systems it's impossible? Why is this blockchain needed at all then?

&rey: Full onchain systems usually don't need their transactions state. In most cases, they can be reduced to operating with a small chunk of data and current transaction. In TON Blockchain, this is known as transition from global to local consistency conditions. (reply to 21336)

&rey: Storing big amounts of data is not effective for sharding ‚Äî separating big blockchain into small shards that can operate by themselves.

Whitey: TON chain have a random generator? If that is, Is it real or pseudo random?

&rey: https://ton.org/docs/participate/own-blockchain-software/random (reply to 21339)

&rey: Random is generated by validators, usually from OS randomness source. (reply to 21339)

Whitey: Can I, for example, make contract, that will store history data in new deployed contract for each new day? It makes sense? (reply to 21338)

&rey: Yes, though this history could be too big to be processed afterwards. For reference, each transaction uses at least 649 bits and takes no more than ~0.01 TON from sender. (reply to 21342)

&rey: Also, you have a gas limit of 1 TON per transaction (incoming message).

Whitey: I need only get info about last hour each hour, info older two hours (e.g.) no longer needed

Whitey: Maybe is there have to rewrite information, for make it cheaper?

&rey: What processing do you want to do with it afterwards? (reply to 21345)

&rey: Creating new cells is rather expensive, though it will obviously be needed for storing data in contract's storage. (reply to 21346)

Whitey: For selecting winner (for example) of last hour, combining random + wallet biggest transfer summary amout for increasing probability (reply to 21347)

Whitey: For example - I have one wallet, who make 10% of total amount (in last hour) and who make 90% amount, next will select item randomly from array - [one, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two,]

Whitey: Or 30 ~ 70 - [one, one, one, two, two, two, two, two, two, two]

Whitey: It's draft idea

&rey: You could limit minimal transfer amount to 5 TON.

Whitey: And what does it give? (reply to 21353)

&rey: It limits transactions number to be stored, thus guaranteeing your contract could process them all. (reply to 21354)

Whitey: Because not everyone can afford such expensive payment? (reply to 21355)

Whitey: Is it impossible - rewrite data in TON storage?

&rey: For example, let's say reasonable limit for your contract is 5'000 TON total. This gives 1000 transactions to be stored, and with effective processing this can fit into 400*1000*1e-6 = 0.4 TON, which is reasonable.

&rey: TON Storage is a separate service, inaccessible by smart contracts. However, you can optimize way of storing transaction in contract's data. (reply to 21357)

Whitey: Only optimize, not rewrite? To save space? (reply to 21359)

Whitey: Stored information is stored forever?

&rey: I've meant that you can load source wallet address and transaction amount from in_msg and store only those parts. (reply to 21360)

Whitey: Also time... It's all (reply to 21362)

&rey: No-no, you can delete old cells. (reply to 21361)

&rey: More precisely, for changing contract data you call set_data with new cells DAG. Contract won't be charged storage fee for any cells not in it, nor nodes guarantee to store these cells for a long time.

Whitey: If I will check time differenct of when new customer makes payment - and if it's more than hour time has passed - then I get all transactions for last hour - calculates winner, then remove all information for writes new for next hour. It makes sense, is it better/cheapest than leave all history forever in the ton blockchain? (reply to 21364)

Whitey: Is it right way?

&rey: Yes, this makes sense and is obviously cheaper than leaving history forever. (reply to 21366)

Whitey: Thank you very much! You have no idea how you helped me! (reply to 21368)

‚Äî 2023-02-05 ‚Äî

Max: 0xffff is what's sometimes used to indicate that no op defined in the contract matched the one indicated in the message, basically "unknown function"  otherwise, only some tvm exit codes are standardized (such as cell underflow for example), but you wouldn't throw such codes yourself, and smart contract authors are pretty much free to use any codes that are not in that range of standardized ones

talkol: Just remember that if you're writing a dapp (a decentralized app), there's no decent way to rely on an API key because an API key is by definition centralized. This is excellent for development but before the dapp goes to production I recommend that the API Key issue is resolved. (reply to 21461)

talkol: I think sandbox team decided to make another last minute change to the debug api, so let's make sure with them you have the latest version (reply to 21528)

talkol: I want to re-iterate why API keys are conceptually problematic when you're building something decentralized like a dapp.  Lets' say you're building a DEX. Somebody deposits money in the DEX (add liquidity). We want this somebody to be able to withdraw their money at any time in a decentralized way. So access to funds is guaranteed. This is why we're using blockchain.  If your dapp client for the DEX relies on an API key in the withdraw flow, you have added a centralized dependency.  This API Key can be placed in the client code. Not a good solution.. since this has a security issue. Anyone can abuse it. API Keys are normally supposed to be secret to prevent abuse of your credentials.  This API key can also be placed in backend, which is what I noticed some dapps are doing in order to hide it. But then you have a new issue that there's a centralized backend dependency for the dapp which isn't ideal either.  The reason we built TON Access is to resolve this issue. (reply to 21532)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): What is the difference for @ton-core/ton-emulator and @ton-community/sandbox from Howard  There has a few difference repo, for me, coding in Tact, I just want a easy way to test my contracts code. (Might be test in FunC files is fine)  What I know/notice are these three: https://github.com/ton-core/ton-emulator https://github.com/ton-community/sandbox https://github.com/ton-community/ton-contract-executor   - Then what is the difference?  - How I can check the variable/status in the contract easily?  üîó Answer on TON Overflow

Howard: do you have test-net can try out? (reply to 21538)

Seitaro: The ton-emulator and the sandbox implement very similar features, however Tact is most likely more convenient to use with the ton-emulator as it was made by the same developer and more integration examples can be expected. Both ton-emulator and sandbox allows to emulate single transaction as well as chains of transaction for integration tests. In contrast ton-contract-executor (which was made almost a year before alternatives) only allows to emulate ComputationPhase of a single transaction (important, but not the only phase of the transaction). So it is recommended to use ton-emulator/sandbox instead of ton-contract-executor (reply to 21542)

Howard: Sorry, I just deleted the question since I think I can ask a better one.   But thanks for your suggestion! (reply to 21544)

&rey: You are trying to send jettons from root contract instead of minting them. (reply to 21540)

·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†: I want to send from wallet, not to mint (reply to 21547)

&rey: You need to direct your request to your jetton wallet, then. For this example, it's EQDd0ljxhzXAOz4QaEMBQ5PwhWrlBU96mck0sXlHQK_bJ4vb. Jetton wallet address can be obtained through get_wallet_address method on jetton root contract. (reply to 21548)

·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†: oooohhh thank you very much! I'll try

&rey: In short: jetton balances are stored in separate contracts for each user so that sharding becomes effective. You may want to read more at https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons. (reply to 21550)

Jeff: Hello guys, I'm new to TON. I wonder which is the best practice for creating and executing a smart contracts with wrapper class in typescript? In some examples like ton-onboarding-challenge or getgems, it implements Queries for building msgBody. Other examples, like ton tutorial-2 or examples in the sandbox, created wrapper classes that implement the Contract interface and put messaging methods inside of it. Which way is the latest and recommended way? I guess the latter. Is it?

elephan: Ton development is professional, it is not easy for beginners. (reply to 21583)

Anand: Why are Getgems's marketplace contracts not verified yet? Any specific reason? I know their contracts are public but still not verified

LiteCute: For security reasons (reply to 21585)

Tim: üòÇüòÇüòÇ (reply to 21587)

elephan: Hmm. I don't think so. If so, this is very bad for project. I think that's because of competitors. (reply to 21587)

elephan: And also, smart contract quality.

Anand: Very bold statement üòâ (reply to 21587)

Tim: You can verify them by yourself. verifier is pretty young in contrast to Getgems contracts

LiteCute: All you need to check is the Audit report (reply to 21589)

Anand: Do we have the Audit report public yet? for Getgems contracts

LiteCute: That's what you should check (reply to 21594)

Slava: API key can be tied to a domain name using CORS. And there is no way to actually spoof a domain name besides running locally. Honestly, I don't see any problems with using the API keys. The principal questions is the purpose of using them. And right now they are used primarily for RPS throttling, which should be fine. And if we talk about the TonCenter per se ‚Äî we've always said that if you are running in production you should start your own instance of the API server (it won't require an API key). Public TC hosted by the Foundation is just for learning/development/testing purposes. (reply to 21534)

talkol: Running your own instance of the API gateway is a very bad idea for dapps. This is definitely a centralized dependency. If your server is down because you forgot to pay your AWS bill, all your users‚Äô funds will be stuck inside the DEX and they can‚Äôt get them out.  Connecting API keys to domain is also a bad idea. It doesn‚Äôt solve any abuse issues. If the API Key is client side, I can easily create a malicious script that will make thousands of API calls using your key until your key is shut down for over use. (reply to 21622)

talkol: There‚Äôs a very simple test if your dapp client is decentralized or not. Whether any user can fork it and run it completely by themselves uninterrupted.  If the entire frontend runs client-side on GitHub pages, forking it takes one click. And assuming your don‚Äôt have a backend server and you use an RPC service that doesn‚Äôt require an API Key, everything will just work.

talkol: I assume it‚Äôs glitchy because of CSS. If you can edit and fix the CSS on Chrome dev mode when simulating a mobile device, send us the CSS fix and we‚Äôll upload it. (reply to 21632)

Ste: üíéCiao TON community. Here a group of enthusiasts from the official Italian group who want to support our comrade Emilia in shedding light on the tokenomics optimization proposal. We would like to get this letter of questions to the TON foundation, so we ask you to read it and in case you support it we would like you to put a nice reaction to the message and share it, especially if you have contacts in Foundation, being the final recipient.  To make sure the message gets through, we also propose to send the link (https://telegra.ph/A-Community-Proposal-for-Tokenomics-Optimization-02-07) as a message of a transaction to TON Foundation wallets (EQCD39VS5jcptHL8vMjEXrzGaRcCVYto7HUn4bpAOg8xqB2N EQAhE3sLxHZpsyZ_HecMuwzvXHKLjYx4kEUehhOy2JmCcHCT)  Grazie mille!üíé

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Is there any better way monitoring the new NFT Item being minted? from Howard  I am trying to display data on my front-end to help users comprehend how the smart contract works instantly.  To achieve that, we can call RPC from TonCenterAPI to get net_item_index on the Collection Contract (followed the TEP62).  But the problem is, if I have 100+ users (customers) refreshing my website, then it's impossible for me to call an API for 100 times to get on-chain data. I must store the data in a database. Or, maybe there is something like TheGraph?

&rey: In contract, you are trying to load a reference from payload. In JS, you store everything in a single cell. (reply to 21895)

Haider: So, I should use in_msg_body directly like this?  var nft_address_arg = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr(); var to = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();

Haider: Should it be     send_raw_message(nft_msg.end_cell(), 128 + 32); or  send_raw_message(nft_msg.end_cell(), 1);

Haider: Also, should the .store_coins(0) be 0 or some value

&rey: As per https://testnet.ton.cx/address/EQCa_Im8bK_87zA1-kf4EXstMxY46lMb-WFkB1oN5HVvZ1MI, owner has been changed successfully to EQB80WqevHSgbMq-6Lp-jCXK0HqJ9-T0epFV6AVRY4Xn4LL6. (reply to 21900)

Haider: This owner changed when I transferred the NFT from my account to the smart contract

&rey: Well. Your contract requires opcode to be 1, and you are sending message with opcode 0x402faf08 to it.

Haider: So I need to change this line??  .store_uint(op::transfer(), 32)

&rey: I think yes. (reply to 21909)

Haider: I'll try it with 1 like this then .store_uint(op::transfer(), 32) .store_uint(1, 32)

Tim: Don't use 32 without good reason, it destroys contract and makes it harder to debug. (reply to 21903)

Haider: I changed it to 1. It did not work. Is the way I am transferring my NFT to the contract wrong? The ownership changes in the ton-scan.

Ahmet Said: is there code snippet like "wait until deployment"  in  blueprint ton  like in ether js ``await contract.deployed()`` ?

Andrey: for deployment you need attach StateInit to external message while sending it to smart contract, then check when state of account become in active status

Ahmet Said: how can i do it any code snippet i can use ? (reply to 21952)

Alex: like this? (reply to 21951)

Sam: Hi

Sam: i am sending out nfts

Sam: it still stays in my contract

Sam: https://tonscan.org/address/EQAIcu5WsL3JBGXqQwGY89CiOYsse5KyTBnxX0zn6wS-txk0#transactions

Sam: my code      var to = in_msg_body~load_msg_addr();          var nft_msg = begin_cell()         .store_uint(0x18, 6)          .store_slice(nft_address_arg)         .store_coins(0)         .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)         .store_uint(op::transfer(), 32)         .store_uint(0, 64)         .store_slice(to)         .store_slice(to)                 .store_int(0, 1)         .store_coins(0)          .store_int(0, 1);      send_raw_message(nft_msg.end_cell(),1);

Sam: what am i doing wrong?

Alex: Maybe you should add some TON in your message. (reply to 21960)

Sam: i saw an other example      var msg = begin_cell()             .store_uint(0x18, 6)             .store_uint(2,2)             .store_uint(0,9)             .store_uint(nft,256)             .store_coins(amount)             .store_uint(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)             .store_ref(begin_cell()                 .store_uint(op::transfer(), 32)                 .store_uint(query_id, 64)                 .store_slice(to)  ;; new_owner_address                 .store_slice(to)  ;; response_address                 .store_int(0, 1)  ;; empty custom_payload                 .store_coins(0)   ;; forward amount to new_owner_address                 .store_int(0, 1) ;; empty forward_payload                 .end_cell()             );      send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), mode); }  what i dont understand is, here nft is a int, how does that work? i have nft address how do i put it as int?

Alex: Here it looks like accountID. According to TL-B scheme Message address for internal message is:  addr_std$10 anycast:(Maybe Anycast)     workchain_id:int8 address:bits256  = MsgAddressInt;  and in this example: ....         .store_uint(2,2)     ;; $10         .store_uint(0,9)     ;; Maybe = (0,1)  + workchain_id = (0,8)         .store_uint(nft,256) ;; address ...

Sam: how do i get address of msg sender in func?

Daniil: slice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse(); cs~skip_bits(4); slice sender = cs~load_msg_addr(); (reply to 21986)

Daniil: Something like that

Sam: would the sender have to manually send his address ?

Daniil: btw first 4 bits (which I skip in the snippet above) contain flags like ihr_disabled, bounce, bounced

Daniil: Nope (reply to 21989)

Beer: It's a shame there's no Chinese

Daniil: in_msg_full - cell with raw message cell that contains all the flags and additional fields  in_msg_body - slice that only contain body of the message

Sam: aa makes sense

Daniil: () recv_internal (int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) {     ... }

Daniil: @tondev_zh (reply to 21992)

&rey: No. After all, it's unsafe ‚Äî sender could send arbitrary address in message payload. (reply to 21989)

Sam: thanks ill try this (reply to 21995)

Step: how to get stateinit from code and data?  let stateInit = new Cell({refs: [code,data]});    is it right way to do with latest version of ton js library?

Step: ü•π

Daniil: There's type "StateInit" (reply to 22000)

Step: how to use? (reply to 22004)

Daniil: Depends on where do you need it (reply to 22005)

Step: i need to use in tonweb transfer function stateinit param (reply to 22006)

Daniil: Usually you just write {  code: ...,  data: ... }

Daniil: tonweb? Didn't you say "ton js"? (reply to 22007)

Step: i am talking about this param https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/test-wallet4.js#L76 (reply to 22008)

Daniil: Tonweb and ton.js are different libraries

&rey: This is example for TonWeb. let stateInit = new TonWeb.boc.Cell(); stateInit.bits.writeUint(6, 5); stateInit.refs.push(code); stateInit.refs.push(data); (reply to 22007)

Step: this data is valid to pass into .storeDict() ?

Sam: Hi guys i am having error code 9 when i uncomment the commented code       if (in_msg_body.slice_empty?()) {          return ();     }          int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);      if (op == 0) {         setup(in_msg_body);         return ();     }      if (op == 1) {         var ( _, _, _, _, sender_address) = load_data();          ;; slice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();         ;; cs~skip_bits(4);         ;; var (_,sender) = parse_std_addr(cs~load_msg_addr());         ;; cs.end_parse();         ;; throw_unless(35, sender_address == sender);          send_nft(in_msg_body);         return ();     } }

Sam: this is my full code https://dpaste.org/PpwVx

Tim: 9 = cell underflow, contracts wants to read data, but there's no data left, check your cells

&rey: You don't need cs.end_parse();. It checks that there is nothing left in the slice, while this is not the case. (reply to 22014)

Sam: leme try with that, thanks

Sam: still error code 9

Sam: https://dpaste.org/5JgJa  this is how i am intracting with contract  i am using transfer from contract function

Yuri: Hey guys, can I iterate over tuples in FunC?

Yuri: Or use some data structure in FIFO fashion?

Alex: I‚Äôm not sure about the best practice, I used tpop(), tpush() in smart challenge#2. I read(get one by one via tpop()) and wrote in new tuple in the same loop, for example.  I think the winners of 3d smart challenge did something really efficient in 1st task solution. It was gas efficient challenge too, so perhaps there you can find best examples. (reply to 22056)

&rey: I'm exploring plugins for v4r2 wallets, and here's what I've found. ‚Äî TON Connect 2 does not have option to request to add a plugin to wallet; ‚Äî Tonkeeper does not have a way to add arbitrary plugin, only standard subscription.  I want to change that. Is it appropriate to open this as TON Footstep (as custom plugins might be useful for whole TON community, and there are many wallet apps that should support plugins), or should I open separate issues at each project repository?

Behrang: push and pop is good for a LIFO, Last In First Out.  I think here a queue is needed. Maybe adding items to a dictionary with an increasing key, and then reading the dictionary from the min value works. (reply to 22057)

Step: what is the new replacement for parseStack in new ton js library?

&rey: The easiest way, I think is... to send an internal message of minimal value to some predetermined address that will identify the API. For example, EQA___YOUR_PREDETERMINED_ADDRESS_____________E8h.  Then, you need to listen to transactions to that address. TON delivery system will automatically deliver all the messages into one place (one shard), where they can be checked as easily as deposits to wallets. And even when you wish to setup your own node, it will have to listen to only one shard: one with your address. (reply to 22146)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): What's the best way to store a date in a smart contract? from Telegram Chat Import  In developing for blockchain it's important to save space, so it seems better to store the dates in 32-bit integers instead of 64-bit.

&rey: 1. Yes, smart contracts pay rent, though if balance is about 1 TON and data size is no more than a few KB then the contract will be stored essentially forever. Storage fee is taken at each transaction (that is, incoming message). To prevent your NFT to be destroyed, you can fillup its balance by sending a message with some value to it. (reply to 22432)

&rey: 2. Generally, auction contracts store end time, and upon receiving any incoming message they check all pending operations. (reply to 22432)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: But where do these incoming messages come from? (reply to 22435)

&rey: From user interested in receiving the NFT, or from platform, or from someone other. In some auction contracts, even external message (that carries no value) can be used for this purpose. (reply to 22436)

Yuri: Hey guys, does this TL-B make sense: serialized_node$1 num_refs:(uint 3) ref_indexes:(uint8 * num_refs) data:bits = SerializedNodeMsg; send_msg_node$10 dest_addr:(bits256) = SerializedNodeMsg; The first constructor would have 32 bits op = 1, 3 bits uint representing the number of references, and the indexes of the references (if num_refs=2, it'll have 2 uint8), the rest is the remaining bits of data. The second construtor would habe 32 bits op = 2 and 256 bits address.

Slava: It's a long read, but a very well worth it. Especially if you care about Web/JavaScript ecosystem and FOSS.  By the way, I've worked with Denis when I was implementing a browser-compatibility platform for Sberbank that helped to save TONs of traffic and significantly improve website loading performance. I'm amazed on the complexity and the amount of work that Denis has done. He's an idealist and a living example of self-dedication and servitude to the mankind. So if you have an idea of how to save the core-js, it's the perfect moment to help.

Victor: Hi guys, I've connected to the chat via link from TON quest, I think you should change phrase all correct fractions whose denominator is less than or equal to n to  all reduced proper fractions whose denominator is less than or equal to n because currently i.e. for n=4 fraction 2/4 also should be counted, because this is correct fraction whose denominator is less than or equal to n, but according to the test's results you calculate only reduced proper fractions

Anand: Hi, which TON wallet is more developer friendly for deploying and interacting with FunC contracts? I see so many options, ton connect, ton keeper, ton hub etc?

Spite: Ton Connect is not wallet, it is protocol for connecting wallets to some apps. I recommend to use TonKeeper as wallet and Ton Connect 2.0 as protocol to connect wallets to apps

Anand: Ok thanks

Anand: And does this jetton minter ( https://minter.ton.org  ) really NOT work on testnet? I should try with mainnet instead?

Alex: What is unclear? You want to transfer Jettons from Wallet A to Wallet B(both are wallet contracts). These fields are necessary for the following message chain. 1) You request Wallet A do transfer with your keypair. 2)  Wallet A is sending  internal message to Jetton wallet A(transfer request) 3) Jetton A is sending internal message to Jettton Wallet B (internal transfer) 4) Jetton B is sending internal message to Wallet B(notification)  You can learn more details from this article or specify your question more accurately. (reply to 22473)

Anand: Does blueprint have support for TonKeeper yet? (reply to 22483)

Alex: Testnet environment https://minter.ton.org/?testnet=true (reply to 22485)

Anand: It does not connect with any wallet. Even if it does at backend it reads balance of mainnet account associated.   Did you try minting jettons on testnet here?? (reply to 22488)

Anand: I guess so many people facing this issue

Anand: This. (reply to 22213)

James Truong: thanks a lot for this docs. I will read it carefully before come back (reply to 22486)

ZEEGFA: is it Featured Pools showing new opportunities on the ton network automatically or it is manually and manage by Ton Foundation?  Is it activated or what we see now is active but nobody is interested anymore to help as Nominator to fill the Nominator pool and let the validator be activated and start earning money?

shahar: In the meantime you can use https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter-contract (which should be upgraded to use blueprint as well) (reply to 22497)

Anand: This fails at setting path (reply to 22158)

Anand: This. (reply to 22159)

Anand: @mrbonezy

shahar: Do you mean that FIFTPATH is in fact exported as an env var, but you still get this error?  In any case we‚Äôll update to blueprint hopefully next week

Anand: Ok Awaiting Blueprint. Thanks

Anand: Finally everything worked on Testnet for me. I would like to raise a PR after updating the docs and readme if required. I see so many people failing to mint on Testnet.

Yuri: Action phase: actionPhase: {           success: false,           valid: false,           noFunds: false,           statusChange: 'unchanged',           totalFwdFees: undefined,           totalActionFees: undefined,           resultCode: 34,           resultArg: undefined,           totalActions: 1,           specActions: 0,           skippedActions: 0,           messagesCreated: 0,           actionListHash: 1016557193545413100498035410295098846945446235253255915907173320893695228842n,           totalMessageSize: [Object]         }

&rey: 34 - Action is invalid or not supported. Set during action phase if current action cannot be applied. https://ton.org/docs/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-exit-codes (reply to 22547)

Yuri: Ah yeah, I read that, but it's not that descriptive. (reply to 22555)

&rey: Probably, you've serialized outgoing message incorrectly.

Yuri: Hm (reply to 22557)

Yuri: I'm calling the function: () send_msg (slice destination_address, cell big_cell) impure inline {   cell full_msg = begin_cell()       .store_uint(0x18, 6)       .store_slice(destination_address)       .store_coins(0)       .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)       .store_ref(big_cell)     .end_cell();   send_raw_message(full_msg, 0); } (reply to 22557)

&rey: You need to store flag 1, because you store body in a reference. .store_uint(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1) (reply to 22559)

&rey: Also, you send message of zero value with mode zero. Such a message cannot be sent because of transfer fee. You need to send at least 1 nanoTON to recipient + pay for the gas (send in mode 1).

Yuri: Still getting the error (reply to 22561)

Yuri: () send_msg (slice destination_address, cell big_cell) impure inline {   cell full_msg = begin_cell()       .store_uint(0x18, 6)       .store_slice(destination_address)       .store_coins(0)       .store_uint(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)       .store_ref(big_cell)     .end_cell();   send_raw_message(full_msg, 1); }

&rey: Maybe, the error is in some other action (e.g. set_code)? (reply to 22563)

&rey: However, you are still not sending 1 nanoTON to message recipient. Delivery of such a message is not possible. (reply to 22563)

Yuri: Tried with mode 64, no luck (reply to 22565)

Yuri: I'm just doing this for testing: if (op == op::send_msg) {     ;;cell root = assemble_msg();     send_msg(body, begin_cell().store_uint(10, 8).end_cell());     empty_cache();     return ();   } (reply to 22564)

NecroSyS üîê |: cpp? (reply to 22563)

&rey: It seems that destination address is invalid. Could you try send_msg(body~load_msg_addr(), ...);? (reply to 22567)

Yuri: I'm generating the address like this: const destAddr = beginCell()             .storeUint(0, 8)             .storeUint(randomInt(5000), 256)         .endCell().beginParse(); (reply to 22569)

Yuri: added the load_msg_addr() thing (reply to 22569)

Levi: How do I withdraw ton coins from a smart contract?

Yuri: I think you need to implement an op which sends a message with the smart contract balance to another address (reply to 22572)

Levi: Thank you, is this correct:  cell msg = begin_cell()          .store_uint(0x18, 6)          .store_slice(recipient)          .store_coins(amount)          .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)          .store_uint(0, 32)          .store_slice("From SM")      .end_cell();      send_raw_message(msg, 64);

Yuri: Seems correct, the amount should be the balance (reply to 22574)

Levi: Thank you, but it doesn't work on testnet! I don't know why :(

&rey: The correct way is following. const destAddr = beginCell()             .storeUint(4, 3)             .storeUint(0, 8)             .storeUint(randomInt(5000), 256)         .endCell().beginParse(); (reply to 22570)

‚Ñôùïíùï£ùïöùï§: I was thinking about the unstable situation of stablecoins (they have inappropriate names, their situation is not stable at all these days and there is negative news every moment), it came to my mind since Pavel Durov lives in the UAE and has good relations with the ruler of Dubai, why doesn't he want to create a stable coin in Ton network!  You know that the UAE dirham is pegged to the US dollar and for years the rate per dollar is always equal to 3.67 dirhams.  Now that the United States is a staunch opponent of Telegram and probably won't let the stablecoin dollar be minted in Ton network, then Durov should come and mint TAED (UAE Dirham stable coin in Ton blockchain).  As I said, each dollar is always equal to 3.67 dirhams, so each TAED is equal to $0.272479564032698.  In this way, if the Durov brothers make a decentralized exchange and TAED is used as a stable coin and the gas needed for transfers from Ton coin, I think it can become the best exchange in the world and be at the top with this amount of wealth that exists in this part of the world.

Step: üò≠

Tse: I'm trying to host a static TON site in TON Storage. I created a bag containing my index.html file and updated the bag id into the "Site" field on TON DNS.  but when I'm trying to open my TON site, it shows that "This file is not on the whitelist. You can run the gateway without the whitelist yourself - GitHub." with a GitHub link of ton-blockchain/storage-gateway

&rey: You have to launch a proxy (gateway) yourself, public one refuses to serve your file. (reply to 22711)

Step: @pcrafter (reply to 22708)

Step: üòî

Step: No one want to help me? üòí (reply to 22707)

Tse: Does that means users who are using public gateway proxy(the default one comes with MyTonWallet for example) will not be able to access my site? Thanks for the previous answer btw (reply to 22712)

&rey: I haven't worked with auctions, sadly. (reply to 22713)

&rey: Could you share its docs or TL-B schemes? (reply to 22707)

&rey: As far as I think, yes. You could try to use in1.ton.org proxy. (reply to 22716)

Step: Please click the links above (reply to 22718)

Step: Here (reply to 22707)

&rey: Couldn't you send such a message and test if it works? Maybe in testnet. (reply to 22707)

Tse: thanks for your help. do you know why the foundation enabled the whitelist on their proxy server? (reply to 22719)

Step: I don't have this in testnet. I want to make to sure it's correct before sending in mainnet. There is no way to confirm by reading the GitHub contract code? (reply to 22722)

&rey: Otherwise, illegal content could be posted and accessible via that proxy, and that would lead to proxy site (and maybe even ton.org) blocking. (reply to 22723)

&rey: Several times I have made a small mistake that led to message being invalid. I think I've lost (more precisely, not won) 3'000 TON on THC 1 because of that. (reply to 22724)

Tse: But people can still host a TON site via rldp-http-proxy with potentially illegal content and users will be able to access the TON site with illegal content via the foundation's proxy right? (reply to 22725)

Step: In contract, if it's like this int initial_min_bid can i use .storeUint(1000000000,64) ?

Step: Is .storeCoins(amount) equivalent to .storeUint(amount,64) ?

&rey: No. Coins = grams = VarUint16. (reply to 22729)

Step: this? (reply to 22728)

&rey: In this case, no. (reply to 22731)

Howard: Also asked in [Answers], what is the logical time define in TVM?   How can we understand it if it is not a practical number that we can use? Checked in WP already.

Nick: Hey, guys maybe someone got answer to that question? (reply to 22703)

Howard: remember there has an API from TonCenter, obviously like you can see in your TonKeeper wallet that shows all NFT you have in specific address (reply to 22703)

Nick: Yeah, I‚Äôve looked through API of ton center and haven‚Äôt found any method that helps me resolve the issue directly   The only way see the solution of the task is to create web2 application that will act as proxy and will execute the cron job that  monitors block creation in blockchain, queries for get method in contact, and sync the results in local applications Db. Is this the right approach? (reply to 22739)

Moven: TL-B seems very low-level. Do I need to write a TL-B my own if I'm trying to develop smart contract? In what situation do developers need to understand and write their own TL-B scheme?

Howard: from my understanding, yes. (reply to 22740)

Howard: Normally, we discuss TL-B associated the storage of data in the TVM, or the way we modify data in the smart contract. If you follow the [TEP74-Jetton] and Tact implementations here, you can easily identify where the TL-B points out in each line.  In my opinion, it is more like an API standard that people define if they need it, so that contracts can interact with each other. (reply to 22741)

&rey: Understand - on interaction with other contracts. By the way, schemes used are often informal - not parsable by programs. (reply to 22741)

Yuri: Hey guys, if I use dict_set_ref and provide the value as a cell, can I retrieve as a slice with dict_get instead of dict_get_ref?

&rey: Upon dict_get, you'll get slice with no data and a single reference to your stored cell. (reply to 22745)

Moven: Thanks for ur information. So can I said that the utility of TL-B is somehow similar to ABI but for interactions between contracts? (reply to 22743)

Moven: That's an issue I've been confused for a while. Does the TL-B (.tlb) file actually take part in the process of smart contract deployment? Or just as you've mentioned, not parsable by programs (reply to 22744)

&rey: No, it's rather documentation. (reply to 22748)

Moven: Got it, thanks (reply to 22749)

Herm√®s: I also noticed that we will get this kind of "series of Tx" if there are multiple recursive Tx with one single message.  I think, in theory, Logical Time (aka LT) can be chopped into tiny timeframes as Nouns in EVM that can distinguish whether the Tx is in the same block or not. (reply to 22737)

Behrang: My current understanding about Logical Time:  When you send a message to a smart contract, and it generates one or more new messages to other smart contracts, and they may generate some too, all of this might happen in a single second, in a single block. Logical Time helps to somehow order messages one after another. (reply to 22794)

fesal | Patara üê¢: The issue is not with the address, jest shows wrong line (reply to 22851)

Martin: what's the issue?

fesal | Patara üê¢: your get_addr function

fesal | Patara üê¢: counter.fc line 85

Martin: in Func file? (reply to 22855)

fesal | Patara üê¢: yep

fesal | Patara üê¢: in typescript you try to read null value

fesal | Patara üê¢: that's why it gives an error

Martin: I don't get it bro

Martin: you cannot write await in FunC file bro (reply to 22855)

fesal | Patara üê¢: Counter.fc line 85  (slice) get_addr() method_id {     return addr; }   you return a null value  Counter.ts line 69      async getAddress(provider: ContractProvider) {         const result = await provider.get('get_addr', []);         return result.stack.readAddress();     }   you try to read a null value

Martin: okay

Martin: what's the solution

fesal | Patara üê¢: Just load data and return addr

fesal | Patara üê¢: or on the typescript side do not try to read a null value?

Martin: (slice) get_addr() method_id {     return addr; }  is this not the correct way to load the global?

User<6247944943>: NO need? Or you mean "we can't" (reply to 22848)

Tim: you need to send 1 tx to collection. read message before

fesal | Patara üê¢: No, you need to load them first (reply to 22868)

fesal | Patara üê¢: look at the line 80 or 74

Anand: I think there's some bug in ton-defi.org/ton-connection on throwing errors while making a connection to OpenMask or TON Wallet. Everytime you're making a fresh connection to the wallets from https://minter.ton.org/ by clicking on "Connect Wallet" , it opens new tab redirecting to the respective extension url. Very tough to establish a connection on refresh. @mrbonezy please have a look.

Ahmet Said: how can i verify deployed code on test net ?

Alex: You can look by the contract's address with testnet explorer. For example https://testnet.ton.cx/address/kQCGMu0PKVjTlmVnauQ4eMZCGrr1OlDfZRKppO7Fb68fDGp1 https://testnet.dton.io/a/EQCGMu0PKVjTlmVnauQ4eMZCGrr1OlDfZRKppO7Fb68fDNH_ (reply to 22997)

Ahmet Said: I mean verified code in func just like it exists in etherscan. (reply to 22998)

Tim: if you verify it - it shows code

Tim: https://verifier.ton.org/

Vali | QS: What happens if we verify the source code in the explorer, but the contract's code gets updated using set_code() instruction? Does the verified source code disappears?

shahar: Yes, you‚Äôd need to reverify (reply to 23002)

shahar: Also note that verified code doesn‚Äôt appear in testnet yet. (Planned)

Ahmet Said: yes i was about to ask testnet  thanks and its answered already (reply to 23000)

talkol: The source code is indexed by code hash, so if the contract‚Äôs on-chain code hash changes, the source code will change/disappear. Also, if you have 100 contracts with identical code hash, it‚Äôs enough to verify one of them and all the others will become verified as well (reply to 23002)

Vali | QS: Excellent thanks!

&rey: Will verification for testnet TON be possible?) If so ‚Äî will verification be cross-chain in order not to store the same code twice? If so ‚Äî you'll have troubles, because everyone would pay test TON instead of real for verification. üòÄ (reply to 23004)

Xalkan: Hi, is there anything like remote-read/remote-fetch to read a contract's state from another one? I know about the get methods for offchain, but what about onchain, any best practice?

&rey: Only messages sending, because the remote contract could be in a separate shard. (reply to 23009)

Xalkan: Okay, thanks. What about onchain signature verification (given the public key, signed data & signature)? (reply to 23010)

&rey: check_signature() (reply to 23011)

shahar: It will be possible, but you‚Äôd have to verify on both chains. (reply to 23008)

Ahmet Said: other then using get methods directly what r the benefits of verification in ton blockchain? (reply to 23013)

shahar: For the developer - raises level of trust by contract users.   For the user - lets you inspect the code of the contract you‚Äôre interacting with. For any app dealing with substantial amounts this is a must have, otherwise you can‚Äôt tell whether there are backdoors or if the dev is dishonest in any way.

Ahmet Said: i see thanks

Steve: Is it possible to commit state of the contract, but on throwing after the fact still bounce the incoming message?

&rey: I think if contract state got changed, incoming message can't be bounced anymore. What if you committed message with mode 64 (forward incoming value), for example? (reply to 23060)

&rey: You can send a failure message with opcode 0xFFFFFFFF, but it's not equivalent to bounce and won't set that flag.

Steve: no, i need bounce. It is required for a lazy deployment, basically even on failed message i want to try to execute deployment code.

Steve: Transparently for users of a contract

&rey: So let's discuss this from blockchain point of view. > What if you committed message with mode 64 (forward incoming value) and also want the message to bounce? (reply to 23063)

Steve: ofc this would break everything

&rey: Then, it's impossible to do this. However, do you need bounce really? If users are sending messages from their own wallets, you may just return remaining incoming value with mode 64. (reply to 23066)

Steve: jeez, ofc i need bounce

Coalus: Who determines the need and divides the workchain into several shards?

&rey: Validators of overloaded shard (as far as I remember, that's over 60% block space/gas usage across several blocks). Merges are determined by validators of both neighboring shards that are able to merge. (reply to 23119)

&rey: Recently, there have been problems in testnet, because more than 1/3 validators were shut down or unable to connect. I doubt you'll receive test TON for purpose of becoming a validator, though you may ask @f_closer. You may try to connect your validator to MyLocalTon, then disabling it will be harmless. (reply to 23116)

&rey: You'll have to do some tricks with JMPXDATA. I think an easier way is to put code in a masterchain library and then reference it from all contracts. (reply to 23117)

talkol: https://ton.tools/tutorials (reply to 23141)

Behrang: Let me ask in another way.  Currently, Jettons are implemented by storing the Wallet child smart contract code cell inside the wallet's data cell. Wallet code stores its own code in its data cell.  Isn't this a waste? I think a smart contract should be able to access its own code. (reply to 23132)

&rey: Yes, this is wasting space, though most people don't care. TVM in TON doesn't have GETCODE. Possibly it should be added, as Everscale did. (reply to 23144)

talkol: it will solve just half the waste, still parent needs to hold the child code (reply to 23145)

talkol: but true that there are potentially millions of children so waste is bigger there

Narek: Well i guess code for popular things like jettons or nft‚Äôs could be moved to libraries

Dario: yes, it is. And, in my opinion, the solution is the following:   <{ SETCP0     0xHASHLIB hash>libref PUSHREF CTOS BLESS EXECUTE }>c  but sadly looks like there are some broken components that doesnt supports exotic cells, so for now we have to wait. (basically load a code from publib and excute it, so you dont need to store the same long code in all child contract. In internal storage the code used for verification is still this one) (reply to 23144)

Marmi: Hello guys, I'm a Russian who decided to join TON, can anyone explain what's going on in this group?

@A49752: Hey Everyone, Beginner questions warning.  I want to create a contract that one wallet owner can only update. Therefore I'll be happy to know the following: 1. How to store an address on the smart contract? Can I use a global variable for that? 2. what is the data type of a wallet address? Is it a string or a slice? 3. Can the wallet address be fetched from the message data structure? 4. How can I compare two wallet addresses?

Marmi: yeah, can i make money?

Marmi: ?

Marmi: do you mind going to private messages?

liminal: Is after_code_upgrade() method necessary in upgradable smc? And what is it need for?

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: I don't mind, but all i can say on how to make money is that there are two ways: scam and actual services.  Under "scam" i mean making thousands of the same NFTs. If you're not a developer (you look like you aren't), you can just copy-paste over and over, or pay someone else maybe a dozen TONcoins to generate thousands of them for you. So called "games" i also apply to this category, but it's more complicated.  And under "actual services" i mean creating something new and useful. (That you can then monetize by adding a little fee or asking for donations.) (reply to 23180)

&rey: Your contract will be deployed once you wish to use it = send an outgoing message or deploy with a special command. (reply to 23174)

&rey: 1. Global variables don't persist across transactions. You need to store address via putting it in cell and using set_data. 2.

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Do you constantly update it because of new features in ton, or it's not required? (reply to 23215)

Alex: No, this comes from validator-engine kernel. This will require binary recompilation. Anyway the changes would be quite massive, it is not trivial. You can stop the autoscrolling in MyLocalTon and peacefully review txs one by one. (reply to 23216)

Alex: Nodes' binaries are up to date. New features come from time to time. I see now, that time has come to go throughout the issues and featues and incorporate them. Will proceed with it soon. (reply to 23217)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Do wallets without transactions lose their value over time? from Telegram Chat Import  It's known that smart contracts on TON have to pay storage fee, it is deducted during each transaction. And if a contract doesn't have any transactions for a very long time, it would get frozen and disappear so it won't be stored eternally for free.  TON wallets are smart contracts too. Does it mean that if a wallet is not used at all for a very long time, its owner will eventually lose all the money in that wallet?  ---  > This question was imported from Telegram Chat: https://t.me/tondev/113618   üîó Answer on TON Overflow

doni: ok so I dont have expierence on lite server

doni: not sure what sync stand for lite ‚Ä¶

doni: try to query your full node with lite client

F: You need to install with key -m full. When installing with key -m lite, the node is not installed. Installed only lite-client, not lite-server. (reply to 23341)

Step: i installed validator-engine separately (reply to 23349)

F: After installing the node in mytonctrl -> status should appear the node/validator section. Inside which the desynchronization time will be written. If this block is not present, then the installation was incorrect. (reply to 23350)

Gabriel: hey guys, I am wondering is there any way to obtain onchain randomness when developing smart contract?  I saw there is a random function provided by the stdlib. But this can only generate pseudo-random number. So I am wondering if there is alternatives?

Daniil: There is no way to generate *really* random numbers in computer (maybe only in a quantum one) (reply to 23361)

Daniil: Any random that you see in internet and apps is pseudo-random

Gabriel: Is there a way for us to read it somehow? It doesn't have to be "generated". We're ok if there is a way for us to read it from an oracle or other sources. (reply to 23362)

Daniil: Then you can just generate the random offchain and pass the result to contract on deployment (as I understood, you need to get random on deployment) (reply to 23364)

Gabriel: Not just for deployment, we are looking to betting platform which will requires randomness for each game. And we don't want people to be able to predict the result.

Daniil: https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/random-number-generation (reply to 23366)

Gabriel: Nice, thanks!

Daniil: It's a bad idea to build 100% on-chain casino. It leads to bad experience for users and risks for owners. (reply to 23366)

Gabriel: We want the part that is related to the result (randomness generation and reward distribution) to be onchain so it's verifiable (reply to 23370)

Daniil: Online gambling websites provide verifiable randomness for many years already (reply to 23371)

Daniil: You just generate the result before the first bet and show hash to users. But be careful and don't hash some simple kind of results like YES/NO

Gabriel: is there a concrete site that I can take a look or try it out? (reply to 23372)

Daniil: I can send you a few links in dm. I don't think sending some casino links in this chat is ok üòÅ (reply to 23374)

Vinayak Dubey: for syncing a ton node, i was wondering if there is any way i can sync it using a DB snapshot

Vinayak Dubey: if not readily available any way i can create it myself

hamoon yaghobi: We need a professional programmer to cooperate in the smart contract project in the ton network. Please send a message

What i done and waht can do? Sent it further or reverse transaction? Help please, from my side in success case I'll sen my helper 5üåê, all what can do as thanks.

Brainoir üí†: No communication with other side. They understand Blockchain worse than I

Daniil: It's an inactive address (reply to 23391)

Daniil: Maybe the receiver just didn't make any outgoing transactions?

Daniil: Ask them to do so, it will activate the wallet.

Step: TVM has mempool like bitcoin?

Andrew: no (reply to 23396)

Daniil: Well, there are still some message queues (reply to 23397)

Step: how to access and read queue? (reply to 23398)

Daniil: You don't need it (reply to 23399)

Daniil: And you can't really change the order of these messages. They are processed in the order of their Logical time

Step: i just want to read the transaction (reply to 23401)

fesal | Patara üê¢: How can i send batch messages? Like do this and do this stuff in one transaction?

Daniil: Use highload wallets (reply to 23403)

&rey: Currently, you can do nothing, only the other side has control over the NFTs. You may ask them how have they even got this wallet address. (reply to 23391)

Daniil: What do you mean exactly (reply to 23402)

Step: i want to read message/transaction before being added to block or something. (reply to 23406)

Step: is it something possible?

Daniil: Why do you want to do so? (reply to 23407)

Step: i want to compete in transaction race (reply to 23409)

Step: for the purpose of quickly buy nft (reply to 23410)

Daniil: If you already see some tx in that queue, you probably won't be able to compete with it

Daniil: There's still some chance of doing so, but still not guaranteed

Daniil: And also, these "NFT buy" transactions are pretty rare in terms of one single NFT, so there won't be any queue at all (reply to 23412)

Tim: it's about 50\50 actually, but to know tranasctions beforehand you need validator

Step: if two people sending ton to one contract at same time how to be faster and ahead of anyone?

Daniil: Messages are processed in order of their logical time, if we are talking about one exact contract (reply to 23416)

Step: yes single contract (reply to 23417)

Step: how logical time calculated? (reply to 23417)

Daniil: Validator can set almost any logical time to messages that they want. But how it usually happens can be found in the sources of validator engine (reply to 23419)

Step: it has any relation to unix timestamp?

Daniil: No (reply to 23421)

Oleg: Technically it can be done by listening for overlay broadcasts in shardchain network, you can catch external messages with a chance that they not yet reached validator, build your own message and send it directly to validators, then it may be processed faster üòÅ but chance is low, it is more like random

Tim: I've tried sending 2 highload messages with interval of 1 second and their execution order is 50/50 (reply to 23423)

Tim: so racing is easy if you know when to do it

Tim: knowing when is very hard, because transactions go straight to validators

Step: can we directly push transaction to validator? (reply to 23426)

Oleg: not straight actually, boradcast goes to 5 random neighbours (reply to 23426)

Oleg: technically yes, over adnl udp you could send broadcast directly, but it is still random, caught message may reach validator before you catch it, you dont know, it is random graph (reply to 23428)

Daniil: Only user can transfer their jettons (reply to 23535)

Daniil: It's tlb scheme of message body  Read more in docs:  - https://ton.org/docs/learn/overviews/tl-b-language  - https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/internal-messages (reply to 23536)

Daniil: Sadly, but the NFT & Jetton standards does not require the notification message to be sent (it's not necessary by the standard). You basically need to parse the whole blockchain history.. or use the existing APIs like tonapi.io (reply to 23533)

Daniil: By the way, what's the reason to not force the jettons & NFTs to send that notification? Just to save a few 0.001s TON in fees?  There's no possibility to create a wallet that supports NFTs & Jettons without using some 3rd party APIs because of that. (reply to 23539)

&rey: Nothing stops from modifying the standard, except that currently deployed NFTs would not support that. By the way, there could be implemented a feature "upgrade from". (reply to 23540)

Daniil: Hm... But anyway, even if the notification is always sent, we can't really be sure that some old notification is stored on full nodes... (reply to 23540)

&rey: Archive dumps can be checked to be truthful and complete. (reply to 23542)

Daniil: But there's no guarantee that these archival dumps will exist forever. And at some point, all archive nodes may just disappear (reply to 23543)

&rey: They can be "compressed" (all non-notifications could be pruned from tree). However, this requires a way of proving that everything pruned is not transfer notification... (reply to 23544)

nyf-nyf: Hi guys. I'm trying to make a Request to store my Bag on my storage provider. I configured my storage provider, created contract. I made a request with command  `new-contract-message <BagID> <file> --query-id 0 --provider <address>`  Now I have a file with body. But I can't guess what should I do now? The docs says send the message with this body to the provider's address. How can I make it? I've tried to use lite-client (sendfile command). Also I tried to base64 encode the file body and send it to the provider address using my TonKeeper wallet, but it says that message is too long.

Step: did you use toNano('0.01') ? (reply to 23583)

Berke: No, I will try asap

Step: if you can show your code snippet i can try to help

YÃ∑AÃ∑MÃ∑IÃ∑: You are right ü•≤ (reply to 23587)

Berke: Well the most basic one is from the https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials/01-wallet/  await walletContract.sendTransfer({     secretKey: key.secretKey,     seqno: seqno,     messages: [       internal({         to: "EQDrjaLahLkMB-hMCmkzOyBuHJ139ZUYmPHu6RRBKnbdLIYI",         value: "0.001", // 0.001 TON         body: "Hello", // optional comment         bounce: false,       })     ]   }); (reply to 23583)

Berke: Tried doing value:  value: toNano(1), it turned same       throw Error(`value is out of range for ${bits} bits. Got ${value}`);                       ^ Error: value is out of range for 8 bits. Got undefined

Step: change value: toNano("0.01")    input is string (reply to 23589)

Berke: I think it is sting | number | bigint I changed to  value: toNano("0.01") but still same error, tried with value: toNano("1") too same

Berke: Weird, does the tutorial code work for you?

Step: check line numbers of error origin  , error value does not mean sendtransfer param value. error should be from somewhere i think.  https://github.com/ton-core/ton-core/blob/43472ce33212995584ed0193d0ce31a881a213a1/src/boc/BitBuilder.ts#L96 (reply to 23592)

Berke: Yeah exactly, sorry should've provide you the full error, will try something and update it

Berke: Oh btw, just checked, Tonweb uses amount: TonWeb.utils.toNano("0.001") in its transfer function

Berke: I was rying the tutorial with npm ton

Berke: What are people using for SDK? TonWeb or npm ton

Step: I have used both. But ton is widely used i think. (reply to 23599)

Oleg: Your node is active, liteserver works, 10k needed to be a validator, no ton needed to just run a full node  2tb is archival node, simple full mode is ok to run with small disc, it takes near 100gb month I think  You could configure it to not store state and transactions longer than a week (reply to 23641)

Oleg: To get liteserver key execute installer command in mytonctl, then plsc command

Oleg: Then use it to connect in tonutils lib or etc

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Most likely he means that he does not have section ===[ Local validator status ]=== in his status This is due to the fact that he set mytonctrl in lite mode: https://t.me/tondev_eng/23340  If you want the mytonctrl to display the status of the node, you need to uninstall and reinstall it with full mode: https://t.me/tondev_eng/23349 (reply to 23644)

Step: ü§î

F: Pay attention to the message: Validators config.json already exist. Break FirstNodeSettings fuction This means that you didn't delete all the files before installing, so the installer skips node setup. To remove all components, you need the command: bash /usr/src/mytonctrl/scripts/uninstall.sh

Step: why mask address when error says incorrect address? (reply to 23698)

Step: ü§£

F: Failed to stop dht-server.service: Unit dht-server.service not loaded You didn't install it, so it says it couldn't uninstall it. It's ok, you can skip it (reply to 23694)

Step: dht server is essential component for full node? (reply to 23701)

F: It is part of it like other components. But here it means only its separate part without the node itself. You can install DHT-server without a full node. (reply to 23702)

Irany: Bom dia

Alireza: Hello,  Sometimes, the swap space on validator nodes can become full, which requires urgent action to resolve. However, since the server is an active node, any disruption to the process may result in punishment. To perform the necessary operation, I must follow these steps:  1- I must not participate in the next election. 2- I need to wait until the current validation cycle finishes. 3- I can then restart the validator process to free up the filled swap space. 4- I must wait until the next election and validation cycle.  Unfortunately, this means losing an entire cycle for a relatively simple operation that only takes a few seconds.  I would appreciate it if you could answer these questions:  1- Is there a way to pause an active node for a brief period to perform an operation without causing any disruption that could result in punishment?  2- Why does the validator process cause the swap space to become full?

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Judging by the near-zero network load, the problem is in connecting to the Internet, perhaps something is restricting it, for example, a firewall.  It is also interesting how you display the version of the mytonctrl and validator. (reply to 23974)

&rey: I think by checking its balance through either your own lite client or some API. (reply to 24004)

Daniil: Use some library like tonweb or ton.js to check the address validity (reply to 24004)

Kaan: Yeah I'm thinking of using Ton http api I've found it just now, there's a method it shows true or false if the address is typed correctly.

Vlad: Hi, guys! I need to store multiple data in the FunC contract. (Ex. array) How can I do it?

Vlad: Wonder if this code will work: set_data(begin_cell()                         .store_uint(counter, 64)     .store_uint(operation,32)     .store_uint(sum,64)     .end_cell())

Daniil: Yes (reply to 24011)

Vlad: and later how can I acces it? var ds = get_data().begin_parse();        var counter = ds~load_uint(64); var op = ds~load_uint(32); var sum =ds~load_uint(64);

Danila: Yes (reply to 24013)

ÏàúÎ≤î: Hi guys, I'm making some multi-sig contract, and I want to know how can I request my app user to make signature.  I'm testing my contract with 'mnemonicToWalletKey' exported from 'ton-crypto' so that I can get my private key, but I'm wondering  how can I request user tonkeeper to sign some data? and above all is it possible to request user tonkeeper to send external message to some contract?

Daniil: There's no way to request a signature of custom data yet in tonkeeper. (reply to 24015)

Daniil: And about external messages - you can send them from the browser or from anywhere else (reply to 24015)

Daniil: Did you know about the official multisig contract by the way? https://github.com/ton-blockchain/multisig-contract

ÏàúÎ≤î: yeah, I read it and making my own contract now (reply to 24018)

ÏàúÎ≤î: thx a lot! maybe I should use internal msg... (reply to 24016)

Vlad: I just don't fully understand how  data is stored and how I access it: Is it stored into the cell in the order I set ‚Äústore_‚Ä¶‚Äù functions? And later I must load it in the same order? What if I want to skip some data entries? (reply to 24014)

Daniil: Data is stored in cells. You just build a cell and do set_data(). Later you can do get_data() to get that cell from contract's data and parse it to load your stored variables (reply to 24021)

Vlad: Then I parse it and get a slice, right? (reply to 24022)

Daniil: Yes, and you can load these values from slice (reply to 24023)

Vlad: I just don‚Äôt understand, how the ‚Äúload_uint‚Äù functions know, which of the 64 uints I want to get

Vlad: If I stored two of them for example

Daniil: Cell is just a sequence of bits and some references to other cells (so that you can store almost any amount of data) (reply to 24025)

Daniil: So if you do: .store_uint(0, 3).store_uint(1, 2)  You'll have a cell that has "00011" bits value

Daniil: And .load_uint() loads the values from the beginning of the slice. So: a = s.load_uint(2); ;; '00' b = s.load_uint(3); ;; '011'

Daniil: If you store and load in the same order, you'll get the values correctly for sure

Vlad: Thank you, now I understand it better! (reply to 24030)

User<1418229103>: hello, how to deploy contracts to testnet? I found a guide https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials/02-contract/ to deploy, but there are some expired method at guide.

User<1418229103>: the sendDeploy method didn't work for latest tonclient

changmyeong: You have to declare in ts interface (reply to 24035)

Daniil: It is declared above (reply to 24035)

ÏàúÎ≤î: I have some questions about external msg.  what I understood is that external msg doesn't carry value. but I know that if contract not 'accept_message()', the gas fee (like computation fee) is deducted from msg gas credit. I think it is contradiction and I am misunderstanding it.

Nha: hi, I wonder how TON check the ownership of an NFT. What I see in the smart contract is just something like:    throw_unless(401, equal_slices(sender_address, owner_address));   What if someone crafts a message and states that he is the owner of the NFT and he would like to change_owner to his second wallet?

User<1418229103>: cannot invoke walletContract.sender() method (reply to 24035)

User<1418229103>: I want to deploy getgems collection and nft contracts: https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts. But the guide is not matched latest ton/ton-core method. I'm very confused.

ÏàúÎ≤î: you can also find that in collection contract, so that only deployer of collection (or owner) can deploy the nft.  but if you remove that part from collection and deploy the nft with account (let A) that is not owner of collection, you can make nft whose owner is A.  but you should not remove throw_unless(401) part of nft contract because it maybe about ownership_transfer (reply to 24039)

Daniil: It's impossible to spoof the message sender (reply to 24039)

&rey: If contract does not accept external message, it looks like it never existed in blockchain (maybe except deployment message). (reply to 24038)

ÏàúÎ≤î: but isn't it okay if gas_credit is enough for computation even if contract doesn't 'accept_message()'?  I understood that the fee is deducted  from msg gas credit before 'accept_message()' and  from contract balance after 'accept_message()'  and if I'm right, I'm wondering where the gas credit came from, cause It is external msg (reply to 24044)

&rey: It's only credit: it has to be returned from contract's balance. (reply to 24045)

ÏàúÎ≤î: thanks bro. can you check did I understand rightly?  1. external msg carries msg without value and all the fee is due of contract  2. 'accept_message()' only means that I credit the msg so that I'll set gas limit sufficiently  3. in the forwarding gas fee point of view, the difference of external and internal msg is that external msg is up to contract(receiver), and internal is up to sender  4. so that the total (sender + contract) gas fee for external msg will be equivalent to that of internal msg  is it right? (reply to 24046)

Daniil: accept_message() call means that contract confirms to pay for the fee for this message (reply to 24047)

ÏàúÎ≤î: Thanks a lot! Have a good day~ (reply to 24048)

User<1418229103>: use these code cannot deploy correct collection contracts, what should I do when construct msg payload?

Vlad: I wonder how can I store strings in the contract? or some class? Ex: class student:         string name;          int mark;

Seitaro: You can store strings as slices https://ton.org/docs/develop/func/literals_identifiers#string-literals you also can use these strings to send text comments in messages : slice my_string = "Hello world!";  ... builder msg_body = begin_cell().store_uint(0,32) ;; specify that it is a comment                                                         .store_slice(my_string); (reply to 24051)

Daniil: Also if you want to send a message with long comment (128+ characters), check this docs page: https://ton.org/docs/develop/func/cookbook#how-to-send-a-message-with-a-long-text-comment

Vlad: Thanks! (reply to 24052)

User<1418229103>: how to pass stateInit param when transfer?

User<1418229103>: there is not stateInit param in transfer method

Daniil: Which library is it? (reply to 24056)

User<1418229103>: ton

User<1418229103>: I found a createTransfer method that included stateInit, but cannot send transaction.

User<1418229103>: do you have some doc that explained how to send transfer ?

&rey: Maybe, separate kind of serializing strings should be added in FunC compiler, that would include those 32 zero bits in slice to reduce instructions count? (reply to 24052)

Seitaro: Concatenation of such strings become less obvious, store_comment/store_text_comment helper looks more appropriate choice here (reply to 24061)

&rey: Yes, however I honestly don't know how store_comment could modify passed slice, especially if it's not literal but rather generated in runtime. (reply to 24062)

User<1418229103>: So, how to use ton-community/ton to create contract? How can I pass stateInit argument?

User<6247944943>: Hi, is there a way to fast-track pending transactions for my contract that allows everyone to mint NFTs? We would like to track these transactions and display them on our website or front-end.  The problem is that the TonCenter API is not fast enough to send messages to the user's front-end side. Users will obviously notice if there are a few seconds without any change on the page and won't know if their transaction was sent successfully.

User<1418229103>: How to write cell to cell?

&rey: 1. append content? Create builder, convert both cells to slices and write both into that builder. 2. store reference? Put your (root/parent) cell content in builder, then use .store_ref(). (reply to 24068)

&rey: TS may have function storeRef, if I remember correctly. (reply to 24070)

User<1418229103>: ok

User<1418229103>: thank you

User<6247944943>: üëÄ (reply to 24065)

&rey: 1. In general, you have to wait 15-25 s before transaction is shown in API (that's for mainnet, and testnet was even slower at the time I was checking it). 2. You can use event streams from tonapi.io, and possibly track user's wallet instead of your contract. 3. If you use TON Connect 2.0, you can receive BOC of external message that has been sent; you may track existence of such message in blockchain. (reply to 24065)

User<6247944943>: I can't sure how many wallet addresses are calling to my contract...? But thanks for reply.   Oh cool, so if my pages using TonConnect2.0, I basically can get the log / or data that knowing who is sending Txs to my contracts? (reply to 24076)

&rey: Yes, when you ask user to connect wallet, you receive its address. (reply to 24077)

User<6247944943>: then I paste it tot TonAPI to track his Txs and see if he is sending message to the blockchain? OK....

User<6247944943>: good to try.

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Should i keep all nfts in a global smart contract, or implement some logic to fetch all nfts?

&rey: Usually, explorers implement logic of NFT enumeration themselves, if you provide a method (on collection contract) to get NFT address by index. (reply to 24081)

&rey: And you shall not keep list of all NFTs in a single contract, as once upon a time the update transaction will have not enough TON and fail.

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Why should NFTs use TON Storage, if it requires regular payments?

ÏàúÎ≤î: I'm making lazy minting code, and is there any example I can access? or can I get some idea? I'm wondering these.  1. how can I request user wallet (tonkeeper) to sign some data.  2. if #1 is solved and I construct DB, how can I let user's nft after minted to transfer to somewhere I want to send. can I make AuthenticatedProxy in ton chain, i.e. can I use delegate call? and if I can, how can I let nft to give authentication before minted?

User<6247944943>: anyone know how to pop with Back to fragment.com in TonConnect? (reply to 24086)

User<6247944943>: we integrate TonConnect successfully and edit in json file that with URL fields and more. But still can't get this return method as we did in Fragment.com. Why?

Step: fragment uses v1 tonconnect (reply to 24088)

User<6247944943>: wait, what (reply to 24089)

User<6247944943>: So V2(or the latest version) doesn't support fallback to web-page? (reply to 24089)

Tim: It does

Step: i am not sure about v2 just know fragment uses v1 (reply to 24092)

User<6247944943>: is there any code for V1 TonConnect? Thanks! (reply to 24089)

Tim: Use v2 (reply to 24095)

Tim: Tonconnect/ui

User<6247944943>: then can you share where is the field for the return URL we can add? Like I showed on Fragment.com? (reply to 24093)

Tim: Just use working package if you can't make it work by yourself

Tim: ^^ (reply to 24098)

Gajesh: are there any frontend templates for TON apps?

User<6247944943>: ok, thanks a lot. ^^" (reply to 24101)

Gajesh: can there be multiple messages in one tx?

&rey: At most 1 incoming, and 0-255 outgoing. (reply to 24104)

Gajesh: got it. thanks! (reply to 24105)

Step: Can we send ton from multiple wallet in single transaction/external message? (reply to 24105)

&rey: No, however you can forward message to second wallet to make it send next messages. (Though, second wallet will be some other smart contract, or you'll have to install first wallet as plugin of second.) (reply to 24107)

Gajesh: on https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui-react:  what should i pass in manifestUrl while testing on localhost?

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Theoretically, it's possible to zero all fees if enough of validators agree?

&rey: Yes, but this could result in network overload not more than after 24 hours. (reply to 24110)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Because of storage and compute usage rising up to the sky? (reply to 24111)

&rey: Yes, someone could bet on TON price fall and then deploy contract sending 255 outgoing messages to itself upon each incoming, increasing computations for block exponentially. (reply to 24112)

&rey: Some messages could be sent to random addresses, making sharding less effective.

&rey: Or the same contracts with other data (to randomize address) could be deployed, so they are in another shards, and sharding becomes totally useless.

talkol: Tact Software Foundation  We are happy to announce the establishment of a Tact Software Foundation (TSF for short): a non-profit organization whose goal is to build developer tools for the TON ecosystem to accelerate TON adoption. Such tools include Tact Language, core libraries for most major languages, excellent education materials, and many more.  Four founders manage the foundation: * Oleg Andreev (Tonkeeper and Ton Apps) * Steve Korshakov (ex Ton Whales and Telegram) * Tal Kol (Orbs) * Kirill Emelyanenko (TON Foundation)  With help of advisors: * Kirill Malev (First Stage Labs) * Lyubov Shombina  Building for other developers is fun. Therefore, we want to create a solid developer-friendly organization where talented developers can do what they wish in the TON ecosystem without worrying about uninteresting things. Together we can collaborate faster and rapidly expand what is possible in TON by solving most of the long-standing roadblocks to developing new tools and services for TON.  Starting today, we welcome all developers of libraries for Ton for any major language to contact me (@steve_kite) to discuss collaboration options and funding your work under TSF.  In the coming days, we will introduce our new branding guidelines, start fundraising and release Tact v1. (forwarded from TON Development News)

vsnation üü£: Thanks! The issue with lengthBytes of a domain got 1 hour of time. (reply to 24194)

Vladimir: Yes it is hard to understand and to do it right.  Verifying the TonProof should be done once per wallet connecting to the backend.  Did you already  verified authentication with JWT (Json web Token)  that should be done for every request that the backend receives? (reply to 24196)

vsnation üü£: It's not required to make it in each request. (reply to 24197)

vsnation üü£: You can put your token into session and that's it

Vladimir: But after you need to verify it.

vsnation üü£: You need to verify it only once (reply to 24200)

vsnation üü£: It will be like auth form for a user

Vladimir: Tonproof only once, but the authentication beaer for every request.

vsnation üü£: authentication beaer is not needed (reply to 24203)

User<6247944943>: What is  the cost to store data in the TVM TON Blockchain at this moment?  And what is the difference if we using TON Storage rather than Cell?

&rey: In blockchain, 1 MB costs 4 TON per year. (reply to 24244)

Dario: ton storage => offline , depends on provider ton cell => check ton storage fee (reply to 24244)

Tim: sounds too cheap (reply to 24245)

User<6247944943>: interesting (reply to 24246)

&rey: TON Storage only ensures storage providers don't receive money if they don't store the file, and not ensures that files are actually stored. This is more about availability. (reply to 24244)

Andrey: There‚Äôs some price for deploy it, so I guess it cost more (reply to 24247)

Step: send individual content in payload/body when minting? (reply to 24270)

vsnation üü£: Is there a way to ask transfer of NFT via TONKeeper qr or link?

Tim: They're implemented, check official contracts (reply to 24270)

Maksim: https://github.com/tonkeeper/wallet-api#transfer-nft (reply to 24274)

vsnation üü£: Do I need to keep [] in arguments? Url opens sending of TON in any case, not NFT preview or something  nft-address - which one, Raw or human-readable?

Tim: I'm not sure this api is working with all wallets. Better to use base64 encoded payload with transfer body  But [] should not be in the end url

vsnation üü£: Can you navigate me please to the doc about it? (reply to 24279)

Vlad: I am looking into this tutorial, step 9: https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials/02-contract/  async getCounter(provider: ContractProvider) {     const { stack } = await provider.get("counter", []);     return stack.readBigNumber();   } how can I set arguments for the counter getmethod? (in my contract getmethod needs to take one argument) should I set it inside [ ] ?

testertesterov: Maybe this can help

testertesterov: Yes, you can set the arguments for the `get` method inside the square brackets `[]` as an array of arguments.   For example, if your `get` method in the contract takes one argument of type `uint256`, you can set it like this:  ``` const { stack } = await provider.get("get", [123]); // pass 123 as the argument ```  Here, `123` is just an example argument value. You can replace it with the actual value you want to pass to the `get` method.   Make sure to check the argument type and format expected by the `get` method in your contract, and pass the arguments accordingly. (forwarded from ChatGPT4 | Midjourney)

Vlad: Thank you! (reply to 24296)

Howard: Yes, I have used loadRef(), but I don't understand the difference with preloadRef(). (https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/ref/cells#sliceloadref)  My question is, can using preloadRef() cause a crash or result in reading wrong data from another memory space?  What is the difference between loadRef() and preloadRef()? (reply to 24293)

User<6247944943>: üëãüèΩ (reply to 24269)

testertesterov: `loadRef()` and `preloadRef()` are both used for loading data from a reference cell in Tact. However, there are some differences between them.  `loadRef()` is a synchronous function that returns the current value of the reference cell. When you call `loadRef()`, it will block the execution of the current program until the value of the reference cell is available. This means that if the value of the reference cell changes frequently, calling `loadRef()` may result in a lot of waiting time.  `preloadRef()` is an asynchronous function that loads the current value of the reference cell in the background while allowing the program to continue executing. This means that `preloadRef()` won't block your program while it's waiting for the value of the reference cell to become available. Instead, it will return a promise that will resolve to the current value of the reference cell when it's available.  The main difference between `loadRef()` and `preloadRef()` is that `preloadRef()` is non-blocking, while `loadRef()` is blocking. This means that using `preloadRef()` is less likely to cause a crash or result in reading wrong data from another memory space, since it won't block the program while waiting for the value of the reference cell to become available.  However, it's important to note that if you use `preloadRef()` and the value of the reference cell changes frequently, you may end up with stale data. In that case, you should consider using `loadRef()` instead to ensure that you always have the most up-to-date data. (forwarded from ChatGPT4 | Midjourney)

testertesterov: Please write if this analysis helped you üëç

Howard: OMG, lol ü§£ (reply to 24301)

Yuri: Wouldn't loadRef, load and consume a reference from a slice and preloadRef, load but doesn't consume the reference from the slice being parsed? (reply to 24301)

testertesterov: I think this piece of documentation can help solve this issue üòé

testertesterov: Yes, you are correct. `loadRef()` and `preloadRef()` differ not only in their blocking behavior, but also in how they handle references to slices.  When you call `loadRef()` on a slice reference, it will consume the reference and return the contents of the slice. This means that the slice reference will no longer be valid after calling `loadRef()` on it.  On the other hand, when you call `preloadRef()` on a slice reference, it will only load the contents of the slice in the background and return a promise that resolves to the contents of the slice. The slice reference is not consumed, so it can still be used to access the contents of the slice later.  So, if you need to access the contents of a slice multiple times, it's better to use `preloadRef()` to avoid consuming the slice reference. However, if you only need to access the contents of the slice once, you can use `loadRef()` to simplify your code and avoid having to deal with promises. (forwarded from ChatGPT4 | Midjourney)

Andrew: it's very misleading (reply to 24306)

Andrew: there are no promises or async whatsoever

testertesterov: I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that there are no promises or async involved in the `loadRef()` and `preloadRef()` functions in Tact.  In Tact, `loadRef()` and `preloadRef()` are used to load data from a reference cell into a variable. However, they differ in how they handle reference cells that contain slices.  When you call `loadRef()` on a reference cell that contains a slice, it will consume the reference to the slice and return the contents of the slice. This means that you can only use `loadRef()` once on a reference cell that contains a slice.  On the other hand, when you call `preloadRef()` on a reference cell that contains a slice, it will load the contents of the slice in the background and return a new reference to the slice. This means that you can use `preloadRef()` multiple times on a reference cell that contains a slice.  I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused.

User<6247944943>: How megaton fetch the oracle price btw?

Vlad: It‚Äôs actually my colleagueüòÑ (reply to 24312)

Vlad: Can you provide more details, please? (reply to 24313)

testertesterov: The process you described can be used to transform a string into a slice of bytes, and then back into a string. This can be useful in TON when dealing with strings in byte format, which is how they are commonly represented in the TON network. By converting a string to a slice of bytes and vice versa, you can work with these strings in a format that is more compatible with the TON network.  For example, if you need to send a string over the TON network, you would first need to convert it to a slice of bytes using the process you described. Then you could send the slice of bytes over the network. When the slice of bytes is received on the other end, it would need to be converted back into a string using the same process in reverse order.  Similarly, if you are working with an interface that only accepts strings, but you have a slice of bytes that you need to pass to it, you would first need to convert the slice of bytes to a string using the process you described. Then you could pass the string to the interface.  Overall, the process of transforming a string into a slice of bytes and vice versa is a common task when working with strings in byte format on the TON network. (forwarded from ChatGPT4 | Midjourney)

testertesterov: As an AI language model, I am not capable of providing opinions or beliefs as I do not possess personal emotions. However, I can confirm that the process you described can be useful in TON when dealing with strings in byte format. (forwarded from ChatGPT 4.5 | DeepSeek | Midjourney)

User<6247944943>: it's incorrect, right? (reply to 24318)

testertesterov: Depending on what to use, but I think it's worth checking out this code snippet: const str = "Hello World!"; // set string const encoder = new TextEncoder(); // create an instance of the TextEncoder class const strBytes = encoder.encode(str); // convert string to byte array const sliceStart = 1; // set the beginning of the slice const sliceEnd = 5; // set the end of the slice const sliceBytes = strBytes.subarray(sliceStart, sliceEnd); // create a slice from an array of bytes const decoder = new TextDecoder(); // create an instance of the TextDecoder class const sliceStr = decoder.decode(sliceBytes); // convert slice back to string console log(sliceStr); // output the result to the console (reply to 24320)

a: Is it possible to put a time limit on a contract that has been deployed beforehand? Like terminate itself or unable to use its functions? I could not find anything about it.

Daniil: Just add some condition in your contract, like throw_if(123, now() >= SOME_TIMESTAMP); (reply to 24451)

a: I did something like this and I am curious if it is stored in the contract this way and will not execute after 2 mins?

a: Also how can I get multiple inputs?

a: I am pretty confused about what's in this and how to index it

Daniil: Why did you add the 6th line? (reply to 24453)

a: to give the int variable a timestamp on the initial deployment and store it into the persistent storage I believe

a: Bad practice or completely wrong approach?

&rey: Wrong approach. (reply to 24458)

Daniil: As I see, you're doing that on each contract execution. It will reset to the current time on each call this way (reply to 24457)

a: I have just started learning x_x Any help would be appreciated

&rey: Yes + that assignment doesn't put value into persistent storage. (reply to 24460)

a: I thought that it would not happen if I don't write this (reply to 24460)

a: So the last part I have sent puts it into the persistent storage and updates at the same time?

&rey: 1. You need the value to be in initial contract storage; 2. You overwrite extracted value with now() result. (reply to 24463)

a: I'm sorry I couldn't understand what do you mean (reply to 24465)

&rey: Try to explain what your contract must do step by step (with smaller steps than "compare value stored with now()"), then rewrite that logic into code. (reply to 24461)

a: My contract should get 2 inputs. First one must be "1" or "2".  Second one must be how many seconds the contract should stay up. I need to calculate how many 1's or 2's that has been picked. (Which I have done already) I need to terminate this contract after the given seconds has passed.  Everything is fine on getting a 1 or 2 and adding them up. And using a get function to get what's the current status. I am unable to figure out how to get an extra input, in this case "how many seconds" input. And also storing the initial deployment time on the contract. (reply to 24467)

&rey: Is that second input sent by everyone? If not, you should make your description more precise and clear. (reply to 24468)

a: No it will be set when the contract is deployed for the first time and now that you have mentioned it, the time can be a constant and doesn't need to be given by everyone. But my question on how to get multiple inputs is still valid :)

a: A fix suggestion maybe :) (reply to 24460)

a: Do you mean under this by "the value to be in initial contract storage"? (reply to 24465)

&rey: I recommend you to get familiar with TON's cell concept, then look through contracts working with NFTs (https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts/blob/main/packages/contracts/sources/nft-fixprice-sale-v3.fc) and check if you fully understand them. (reply to 24470)

Tomer: Hi friends, ran into some trouble doing the following ‚Äî how can I sign messages between a non-js framework app with tonconnect/tonkeeper? To be specific a flutter app.  I had managed to create and test the contracts on node js with ton libraries. To which it works perfectly.  But I want to achieve this on flutter  I have done alot of research but seems none worked.  Suggestions and questions are welcomed.

Daniil: Ton connect is just a protocol for communications between the app and the wallet. You don't need to "sign" anything.  1) generate link (or QR code) for authorization 2) fetch the user wallet's data (address, balance etc) 3) when you need to send some transaction from user's wallet, use the ton connect API to do so  Everything above is well covered in documentation: https://ton.org/docs/develop/dapps/ton-connect/integration (reply to 24474)

a: Any document suggestion to "get familiar" with the cell concept? (reply to 24473)

Daniil: https://ton.org/docs/develop/data-formats/cell-boc#cell (reply to 24476)

a: I am basically lost, are there any documentations on this load and save part of the code. And is it possible to store the time when the contract got deployed for the first time (SOME_TIMESTAMP) and prevent it to get updated each time? I mean is there a part of the code-contract just runs for once? (reply to 24452)

Daniil: Just don't save it there each time and it won't "get updated" (reply to 24478)

a: And maybe a contract like a boiler plate or some less code. Instead of this one (reply to 24473)

Daniil: You can "store when contract got deployed" by simply placing the required data in contract's StateInit

a: Let me share the whole code that I have been trying to gather, it is not something spectacular anyways. Where is this contract's StateInit and suggestions for this code. (reply to 24481)

Daniil: Remove the 17th line (reply to 24483)

Daniil: And also add the storing of contract_time_of_deployment to the 33th line

a: Like this?

a: And where to define the contract_time_of_deployment so it gets the time of the deployment?

Daniil: Don't call the set_data() for the second time - it will just override the previous one. Instead, store both Total and Time of deployment in the same cell in a single set_data call (reply to 24486)

Daniil: Depends on how do you deploy the contract. There should be some way to change the contract's data (stateinit) (reply to 24487)

a: I am using toncli and just have this writing "toncli deploy -n testnet".   That goes here (reply to 24489)

a: And that goes there

a: Is it the data.fif that I should change

Daniil: Yep (reply to 24492)

a: Well first time seeing this part, looks interesting. Any suggestion on handling this part

a: Definitely saw this part and read about it but did not think of it

&rey: This is Fift. In short, you need <b   0 64 u,   ?time of deployment? 64 u, b> (reply to 24495)

Daniil: In your case, the structure would be like  <b     0 64 u,     12345678 64 u, b>  Just put the current timestamp instead of 12345678

a: Well 2 questions since you have just gave me the fish. Should I add the thing you have given me directly at to the bottom and how to get the current timestamp through fif? The first one "0 64 u" is about the counter variable that I have and it is a uint64? (reply to 24497)

Daniil: Replace the current <b ... b> from your data.fif with the new one from above (reply to 24498)

Daniil: And yes, 0 64 u will be your total which is 64-bit unsigned integer

a: Should I import something to be able to use this?

a: Oh wait...

a: Nope, I still need something that changes dynamically so a timestamp would be perfect

a: Is this a valid solution to that? Seems pretty wrong, but it deploys. What is the best way to do it? (reply to 24488)

Daniil: Yep, that's right (reply to 24505)

Daniil: No, just write "now" there (reply to 24502)

a: Yep, that did the trick. Thanks, for now üòà

&rey: Good luck in learning and buidling) (reply to 24508)

a: What should I write to get slices instead of uint64 in the fif file {0 64 u,}

a: ."<string>"

a: this did deploy but not sure if it works

a: I am getting this on the test side

a: Anything that I might be missing?

Daniil: And what did you put in data.fif (reply to 24515)

a: this currently

a: nothing else I found deployed

Daniil: Load msg addr is for loading the address (reply to 24519)

User<5906393387>: Hey! Is it better to get data from the contract itself or store and get the data from centralized database? (for example, if a dapp is a marketplace)

talkol: It all depends how much data you have. Ideally if you use blockchain you want to build a dapp - meaning a decentralized app. This means its storage should be decentralized. Contract storage is decentralized but very expensive. Ton Storage (like IPFS) is also pretty decentralized and much cheaper, but immutable.  If you have a lot of data that is changing quickly, then maybe a dapp is not what you need. If you make it centralized with a DB, I don't see much benefit from making it a contract then.. might as well write your backend as a node.js app. (reply to 24607)

I want to know how to send two msg like when I make sale contract in getgems.io They make two transactions in one logical time and one wallet confirmation, and two transactions are recorded (reply to 24624)

Daniil: Smart contract can send up to 255 outgoing messages at once (reply to 24625)

User<6247944943>: sale contract in getgems.io? (reply to 24625)

ÏàúÎ≤î: I mean, let contract A is something that send msgs to contract B and C.  If I send msg to A, the transactions I can see in tonscan.org with my wallet address will be only me -> A 0.2 TON  and with address of A A -> B 0.1 TON A -> C 0.1 TON  but I want to see in tonscan.org with my address like this me -> B 0.1 TON me -> C 0.1 TON (reply to 24626)

Daniil: Then send multiple messages from "me" (reply to 24628)

ÏàúÎ≤î: yes, they make two transactions in one logical time via no contracts (reply to 24627)

ÏàúÎ≤î: so how? (reply to 24629)

Daniil: Actually, "me" in your case is also a smart contract (wallet contract). Regular wallet contracts allow you to send up to 4 messages at once. If you need more - use highload wallet

Daniil: But what's the problem with that anyway? (reply to 24628)

Daniil: Why do you want to see something special on tonscan? Don't you just need the result?

ÏàúÎ≤î: cause this way requires 2/3 gas fees (reply to 24633)

Daniil: What? (reply to 24635)

ÏàúÎ≤î: what kind of package brings multiple msg send? or is there any example? that's my point (reply to 24632)

ÏàúÎ≤î: cause me->A->B,C requires 3 transactions while me -> B,C requires 2 transactions. I want to simplify the process. (reply to 24636)

Daniil: Use the highload wallet

Daniil: But actually there's no problem with that. me->A->B,C,D,E... vs me->B,C,D,E... is just a 1 single message difference (reply to 24638)

ÏàúÎ≤î: thank you! I'll try this (reply to 24639)

Daniil: If you want to send a message to 1000 addresses, it will be just 1000 vs 1001 messages. Not a big deal

ÏàúÎ≤î: yeah but only two msgs I want to send. in that case, I'll send via contracts too (reply to 24642)

ÏàúÎ≤î: anyway thank you for answer (reply to 24642)

Daniil: If you want to send just two msgs - there's no problem with that. Tonweb and ton.js libraries support it for regular wallets (reply to 24643)

Andrew: that might just be the Tonkeeper's transaction prediction feature. Tonkeeper displays transaction results even before confirming them in the wallet, that's why it can show multiple transactions on the confirmation screen (reply to 24630)

Howard: Is there any way to increase the speed of transactions being included in the blockchain?  Similar to how EVM allows for paying higher Gwei to incentivize miners to prioritize transactions, is there a way to speed up the inclusion of transactions in the TON blockchain?  To my knowledge, the answer is no. Since every validator works in parallel, the way to check the transactions in TVM is based on Logical Time (LT), and there is no concept of Block Height. (reply to 2121)

Daniil: Gas price is same for everyone (check the config) and you can't "pay more" to force the validator to process your transaction faster. But if you have your own validator you can process your transactions before others (reply to 24656)

&rey: > Since every validator works in parallel, the way to check the transactions in TVM is based on Logical Time (LT), and there is no concept of Block Height. No. Validators know who should produce the next block, and only if he does not respond for some time others start creating that block. There certainly is concept of block height. (reply to 24656)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Is there the ERC1155 standard? The NFT with quantity. from Howard  I'm curious if there is an ERC1155 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a quantity.   In the past, I've checked and implemented NFTs using the ERC721 standard, which is designed for single, unique tokens. However, I've heard that the ERC1155 standard can be used for tokens with a quantity.  Implementing ERC1155 tokens would require a different approach than ERC721 tokens, since they allow for multiple instances of the same token.   With ERC1155, each token type has a unique ID, and a quantity is associated with each ID. This means that instead of creating individual tokens, you create a supply of a specific token type that can be bought, sold, or traded.  I'm interested in exploring the possibilities of implementing ERC1155 tokens for NFTs with a quantity, and would like to research and learn more about the standard and how it can be used.  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md    üîó Answer on TON Overflow

Alexey: Hello, please tell me where to start developing the interface for exchanging your tokens in the wallet? is there any tutorial or documentation?

Alexey: on React

ekt: Hi, maybe bit of a stupid question, but is there a way to attach some sort of config / json / big parameter to nft when minting it on ton?

a: Is there a way to check if someone used the contract before and prevent it being used again by the same address?

&rey: Please remember that someone could transfer their funds to second wallet and use your contract from that. (reply to 24770)

a: Great heads up! This contract will be used in a isolated place lets say :) (reply to 24771)

a: How to do it? Any examples on it? I figure that I need to store the sender_address and how to check if exists?

&rey: If there is limited and quite small number of users, you can store addresses as dictionary keys, probably with empty values. (reply to 24772)

Daniil: simple way - store a dictionary < Address -> boolean > which indicates whether someone has used the contract or no

a: Also is this the way to do it? Any mistakes on the syntax? I know it already comes with the "slice sender_address = cs~load_msg_addr();" But got confused on the storage on contract part.

a: There is no limit for the users that can be in this isolated place (reply to 24778)

a: So there could be 10 100 1000's of people

Daniil: hard and scalable way - deploy a special (but not very complex) contract for each user which will respond to the very first call with True and to all next calls with False. Then to process an action from main contract, first send a query message to that special user's contract and if it'll respond with True, process the action. (reply to 24779)

Daniil: but if your amount of potential users is less than 1-10 thousands, you probably don't need this approach

a: will do! (reply to 24788)

a: After seeing those codes I wanted to give a shot to the documents :) (reply to 24788)

a: How does this looks

&rey: You should just dict_get? (this function is omitted in stdlib somewhy, you could create it yourself) and check success flag. (reply to 24792)

&rey: Also, you should load dict from contract's storage, not create it from scratch with new_dict() each time contract is called.

&rey: + sender_address is slice, so you should use d~dict_set(267, sender_address, ""); This can raise issues in future, when non-267-bit addresses will be used, though I think this is not that important right now.

a: I could not see a function named dict_get? in the stdlib (reply to 24793)

&rey: You can define it just like udict_get?. As far as I remember, that's (slice, int) dict_get?(cell dict, int key_len, slice key) asm "DICTGET NULLSWAPIFNOT"; (reply to 24796)

a: What does this do? Checks if the address exist in the dictionary? Can I use it in a simple if comparison? Like   if udict_get? == sender_address{       return();     }

a: I have defined this at up top and updated the code to this. How is it now? (reply to 24797)

&rey: (_, int flag) = checker.dict_get?(267, sender_address); if flag {   return (); } (reply to 24800)

a: Oh you have already said that I should check the flag, my bad. Thanks! (reply to 24803)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Right now, FunC (reply to 24844)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: How can it be implemented? (reply to 24843)

Berke: Well, I couldnt find a solution, my friend recommended to use what I already got and now Im using the scripts from the tutorials. (reply to 24847)

Berke: & packages

ekt: are they working for you? i get a ton of small and big errors  do you mind if I pm you about some stuff? (reply to 24848)

talkol: External messages have signatures and stuff, why are you sending external directly and not an internal through the wallet?

talkol: I hate deploying with external

User<5906393387>: Yes, it‚Äôs a deployment code (reply to 24858)

Andrey: Problem is that code you provide run messege body you provide. And message body is empty (reply to 24852)

Maksim: and still it‚Äôs not deployed   https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQAowzwuq2f6mbQawhd9GZPkyNfHF_CfUdKhWz8rYmZbMg5x

Samyar: oh i thoght if you just transfer some ton to it, it will get deployed (reply to 24881)

Maksim: also i don‚Äôt really know much about fees in testnet but i think 0.001 ton isn‚Äôt enough to deploy or make transaction, so i think you should top up your wallet (reply to 24882)

a: What am I missing

VU ƒê·∫†O: ChatGPT (reply to 24859)

&rey: Read 4 bits of flags from in_msg_cell. (reply to 24900)

Vlad: Have similar problem even reading the 4 first bits (reply to 24902)

Daniil: and also, read the dicts and other stuff from in_msg_body, not in_msg_cell.

&rey: Also, checker should probably come from contract data, not from cs. (reply to 24903)

D: unrelated qn - is there a TON explorer i can use to check on TON metrics like active addresses, txs etc

Vlad: Here is my sender's address getting function: (slice) parse_sender_address(cell in_msg_full) inline { var cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();   ;; cell storage; cell into slice var flags = cs~load_uint(4);  ;; subtract(take away) flags  slice sender_address = cs~load_msg_addr(); ;; get sender address return sender_address; } (reply to 24903)

Andrew: https://github.com/ton-community/blueprint#deploy-one-of-the-contracts I guess (reply to 24924)

User<1460963135>: There are ready deployers from many teams. To prepare link and to deploy from CLI. You should check project templates and tools provided by developers of what are you using...

User<1460963135>: Here is great examples how to automate deploy. Some teams provide interactive wizards and deeplink to deploy from your wallet. (reply to 24925)

User<1460963135>: you should also checkout tact-lang and their tools. For novice it more simple, maybe: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-deployer (not affiliated with them just using myself BUT with deployer from blueprint)

Alex: Yes, but what particularly do you advise? DYOR,  it‚Äôs an obvious answer to this theme.  I need to check different links and cases of explanation.  As I see, your final answer is tact-deployer. Thanks. (reply to 24926)

User<1460963135>: I said I'm using TACT despite of breaking changes; but not their deployer, I need automation but for simple use it will be simpler to deploy from own wallet to stay owner ‚Äî my final answer is to check out all variants 'cause there is many useful code peaces in every  and one more FREE TIP: if you really want to develop smc you should remember it's can't by done by deploying changes tocheck errors; you will need to run code locally and fast. so check out emulators provided for this purpose  I know it may be hard and great temptation skip ALL THESE TESTS but this is the threshold) (reply to 24929)

Alex: Does anybody else know the source that you could advice with words ‚Äúread this at first, then you will fully understand how the deployment process works‚Äù? Except called above.

User<1460963135>: deployment is just transaction. wtf?  sending coins to new address to pay fees and attached code/initial state

4xMafole: Hi, everyone. I havr been utilizing the tonconnect react ui repo to connect to tonkeeper wallet. But I keep on facing the above error. Any help, or anything I am missing?

4xMafole: Thank you, so much. (reply to 24942)

User<1460963135>: wait I may be wrong here

User<1460963135>: this is in tonkeeper itself?

4xMafole: Yes. (reply to 24945)

User<1460963135>: it's react-native and I saw something like this but can't remember right now

4xMafole: absolutely, correct. (reply to 24947)

4xMafole: We used this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui-react package.

4xMafole: Oops! (reply to 24950)

User<1460963135>: maybe error with some metadata or network error between you and their dc.

4xMafole: How, did you figure that out, then.

User<1460963135>: I can't remember completely but reading emails I can figure out that Keeper on my device was unable to connect to Connect API and this was temporary error.

User<1460963135>: from my app I did login request and after confirmation in wallet and returning to app this happened 'cause lib on back received nothing instead of JSON from their srv and....  on which step you fails?

4xMafole: Let me send it. (reply to 24955)

4xMafole: Here is the bug occurrence.

User<1460963135>: are you sure keeper cat get all needed info from your side?

User<1460963135>: manifest etc

4xMafole: Let me check on that.

Tse: Is it possible to retrieve the public key of other address in a contract?

User<1460963135>: no

a: Reading 4 bits did not helped. I thought that using cs meant getting the data from the (c)ontract (s)torage or something when you have suggested xd. Also I am not loading or saving it like the other variables that I have. I am just using this function. How to store the addresses on the checker dictionary properly? (reply to 24905)

a: code looks like this now and I just have the dictionary right here nowhere else like load data or save data

a: I still get the error "Exit code 9 underflow"

&rey: cs is not magic variable, it just holds what you save there (in your code, slice of in_msg_cell). (reply to 24963)

Berke: Do you guys know how blockchain explorers get address's NFT's as it can't be found from contract without checking every address interaction

Tse: or can a contract send a message to a  wallet contract requesting the wallet contract to verify a signature? (reply to 24962)

Dario: No, there is no such operation rn (reply to 24968)

Dario: But you can verify fully onchain that a pubkey belong to an address onchain, if you know wallet version and subwallet id

Tim: They index every tx (reply to 24967)

Berke: Damn isn't it costy

Daniil: It is (reply to 24972)

Daniil: And it will only get more expensive as the network growths

User<1460963135>: for ppl not familiar with highload and distributed systems maybe

Berke: I know thats how they make money anyways but isn't it really heavy cost to index everything into each other to generate relations, damn

User<1460963135>: this question for core engineers or application developers? as app dev you never need whole BC, think about this. Idea is not so crazy it's scaling on contracts itself. And this happens anyway inside the system, you would like it to be hidden behind pretty interfaces but maybe it's was right desicion to take off this to application

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Is it possible to store confidential data in a smart contract?

User<1460963135>: yes, cipher data outside and store

Andrew: cs is an example of bad naming, but it's a shorthand from "cell slice" (reply to 24963)

Maksim: i think they get amount of collection‚Äôs nfts and for each index from 0 to next_item_index run get_nft_address_by_index method (reply to 24971)

User<1460963135>: look I need to do something very simplar for myself, you can ask later. right now nothing can help remotely. I'm 100% sure this is not bug of keeper or connect but can't help in such way( (reply to 24981)

a: How to load and store the dict in the contract? The examples I am able to find does this but does not work for me? Is there an additional step to this? Maybe converting cell to slice or something beforehand?

Daniil: that looks correct (reply to 24984)

a: gives out error cannot unify type cell with slice

Daniil: are you sure that dict is in your contract's storage when you load it?

Daniil: oh, because the dict is cell (reply to 24987)

Daniil: do it (cell) load_data() {...}

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Is it possible to use the wallet's private key?

Berke: Do you mean not the ur own address? (reply to 24991)

a: Well I tried that before and did not realize the error was caused by somewhere else. I fixed the others including this, thanks! But now I have a problem about the function that needs to check if an address used the contract before. It is about the inputs and outputs again but I couldn't figure out what's wrong. Here is the function and how I *try* to use it. (checker is the dictionary that I load above) (reply to 24989)

User<1460963135>: try to read more docs more tuts and then examples you are far from even in theory and need some time to try to understand completely (reply to 24991)

Anton: Hello! Solidity developers please pm

User<1460963135>: I'm saying this without irony: you need more time to understand basic things to be released from such questions (reply to 24991)

User<1460963135>: If this is critical better pm me in your native language but getting single fact wouldnt help. You need some time + hard work not asking in chat how to implement something U think U need but no. You fails at design of. And do not need nothing you asking about.

Tse: If I would like to verify a signature from a customized wallet. Can I ask the signature sender to also provide all the parameters they used to create stateinit of their wallet, and use these parameters to re-create the stateinit and calculate the address in a contract? (reply to 24970)

User<1460963135>: U can directly get stateinit

Obazii: Help me list my usernames on getgems

Tse: will I be able to retrieve public key from their stateinit? (reply to 25001)

a: I did figure this out, it was about the defined variable names on load_data. Was not loading the dict properly. (reply to 24996)

Jeff: Hello, I send a message from a cell like this   &bin=${encodeURIComponent(body.toBoc().toString('base64')  But the msg_data in the transaction result is slightly different. The middle part is totally same, but the start and end are different.   I want to compare it to know if the transaction was sent successfully. But the difference makes it difficult. How do I do?

Tse: I'm not sure if the stateinit is hashed or something, or I could directly read the parameters within it (reply to 25003)

User<1460963135>: if they put it in there (reply to 25003)

User<1460963135>: you don't need this as I said never ever

4xMafole: Solved. Problem was urls on the manifest. (reply to 24957)

User<1460963135>: I think TonKeeper dudes should really attempt to this and fix such non-informative error reporting 'cause it fails onboarding for novices. AFAIK they are in this group. Let's leave this maybe they see :D.

Tse: Then where do they put the public key generally (reply to 25007)

User<1460963135>: it's sending with tx but not sure about TON completely. It depends on wallet SMC I guess.

User<1460963135>: You do not need nobody other keys.

User<1460963135>: crypto primitives provdes by tvm and data formats and what it stores depends on smc implementation

User<1460963135>: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/main/func/wallet-v4-code.fc here you can see what is initial and what data smc operates and what can be get from it

User<1460963135>: see at line 78: `  var (stored_seqno, stored_subwallet, public_key, plugins) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(256), ds~load_dict()); `

User<1460963135>: this is public key of sender so as I said it's packed with TX itself

Moven: May I ask how to verify the public key is from valid address? (reply to 25016)

User<1460963135>: BUT no option to get any key from address, no

User<1460963135>: there is function check_signature (reply to 25019)

Moven: Understood (reply to 25020)

User<1460963135>: signature if first of all, public key in message, checking by stdlib call

Moven: If check_signature return true, does it guarantee the msg has signed by valid address? Or just the fact that the owner of private sign the msg?

Berke: Im trying to send empty cell with deploy_nft but when i do this my nft item contracts gets not initalized any idea why?  cell replaceByNothing = begin_cell().end_cell(); is this a legit way to create empty cell?

User<1460963135>: this is equal cases

Berke: Pushing it for hardcoded zero didnt work either

User<1460963135>: yes signed by valid it's doing core to pass only valid from valid (reply to 25025)

&rey: Most often, get-method get_public_key is provided, that allows to get key if contract is deployed. (reply to 25020)

Moven: Want to make sure that the signature and public key are from the white list address. Not just some random address which honestly signed the msg with private key and sent its public key to the contract (reply to 25029)

User<1460963135>: yeah but address may be inactive for exampel

Moven: Thanks (reply to 25029)

User<1460963135>: you can't "send from another address signed by key of ..." ‚Äî nonsense

User<1460963135>: because signature will be invalid cause it depends on sender address too

&rey: Why can't you just whitelist public keys and allow incoming messages from any address provided they are signed? (reply to 25031)

Moven: That's a solution! Thank you so muchüòÑ (reply to 25036)

User<1460963135>: remember there is core itself on top of this and messages in tx and tx in blocks are valid but messsage body can store any amount of any keys you like

&rey: Remember that if there are many keys (more than 1000 or unlimited amount of them), you should consider sharding. (reply to 25037)

Tse: I 'm trying to create a contract that allows users to move the fund by providing a message signed by "address A" but does not require the "address A" to be the msg sender  Is this achievable if we do not know the public key of "address A"? (reply to 25039)

&rey: No, I think it isn't. Also you should read proposals on safe signing (some TEP, as far as I remember), otherwise signature could be reused for some unintended purpose. (reply to 25040)

User<1460963135>: this is application logic. you can implement everything you want except of breaking consensus rules. so, inside valid message from A signed by A you can receive any key perform any logic etc

User<1460963135>: ... so you need to accept messages from any address no checks at this point

User<1460963135>: inside message there are some data .... your code doing logic..

Tse: Thanks I get what you are trying to explain. In addition I'm wondering if there's a way I could prove that "a public key is belong to a address" to a contract? (reply to 25042)

Daniil: If you know the wallet version of the contract deployed on "address" (reply to 25045)

Tse: By version do you mean the wallet contract code? or something like v4r2 (reply to 25046)

Daniil: Yes, the code (reply to 25047)

Daniil: The address of any contract in ton depends on both code and data.

Bakenkhonsu | Never DM bro first üíé I üçÖ StonFi: For jetton

Tse: Do I need anything else? or with only contract code and publickey I can calculate the address and see if the result matches what I was looking for (on-chain) (reply to 25046)

Tse: May I know why? security concerns? (reply to 25050)

User<1460963135>: this called financial Pyramide not staking (reply to 25053)

User<1460963135>: there is no such particular problem, why do u need this? (reply to 25055)

User<1460963135>: don't try to solve every task you think you will have. try to start from smth less

Tse: thanks for the advices, I will reconsider if this logic is really essential for my Dapp. (reply to 25058)

User<1460963135>: in common sense address is just hash from public key but in TON things much complicated. adderss you meant may not be wallet address etc etc. to check signature u dont ned it.

Dmitry: Hi all, Why code storeAddress(Address.parse("EQCE...Fgt18")) returns  this error Invalid address. Got EQCE...Fgt18 ? The address is an actual wallet in testnet.  p.s. I use ton-core/ton library

User<1460963135>: to decide is signature correct at app level you should pack this info into data you sign

User<1460963135>: cause you missed smth isnt this obvious?

User<1460963135>: I just spent minutes to check there is no storeAddress nor ton or ton-crypto, maybe using old version dunno

User<1460963135>: and second: provide full address no other way

Moven: okay, I have a clear direction now (reply to 25038)

Uur: Hi, I'm trying to deploy a contract using ton connector.  https://ton.org/docs/develop/dapps/ton-connect/transactions#transfer-with-comment-contract-deployment In here, theres a line state_init.bits.writeUint(6, 5); What does this do? I couldn't find anything about it.

Tim: how can you set address as index if index is defined as int and address is slice? (reply to 24819)

User<1460963135>: storing number "6" using 5 bits

&rey: For dict_set/dict_get?, index is slice. For udict_set/udict_get?, it's unsigned integer. And for idict_set/idict_get?, it's signed integer. (reply to 25073)

Uur: ok, but, why? It is not related to both code and data (reply to 25074)

User<1460963135>: part of header format maybe or opcode or mode flag. continue yur reseach.

User<1460963135>: this is message header

User<1460963135>: message can be completely raw data or maybe packed using basic formats, this is header for state_init I guess smth like this

&rey: It's flags for StateInit, showing that code and data are in references and there are no libraries attached to contract. (reply to 25076)

User<6247944943>: Is the testnet still congested right now? It seems like all of the explorers are taking a very long time to show transactions. (reply to 24916)

Uur: Oh, thanks! (reply to 25080)

&rey: Is some report going to be published? It could show how stable TON architecture is. üòä (reply to 24916)

Gica: hello everyone, here its'g Giacomo from astrid. I have a question. does someone know if theres currently any active oracle on TON ecosyste? thanks.

Gica: we a re a team of blockchain devs and data science developers and would love to build on your ecosystem.

Blake: hello

Blake: what is the best wallet on chrome for working on ton testnet?

Blake: I tried TON wallet, MyTonWallet, Coin98 Wallet extension, but couldn't see testnet option there

User<1460963135>: ton wallet click version holding shift

Blake: it works, thanks so much (reply to 25094)

User<1460963135>: extension wallets are not very popular. checkout tonconnect

Uur: Also, press the version a few times for MyTonWallet

Ahmet Said: while deploying contract is  it possible to invoke one of the function in receive_internal function? for example after deployment complete send a message ?

&rey: Yes, this is possible if you provide message body along with stateInit when sending. (reply to 25098)

ezji: yo guys. mb anyone has URI with content for Jetton?

√ñ: Hi, I am trying to init a contract with TonWeb library. I can't init the dict in the contract. Contract deploys but after the first call, it starts retuning exit code 9. This is my code.

√ñ: I found this function in Tonweb Lib and yought that writing 0 would work

m√†t√≠n: ‚úã hi  I know solidity well  but func  is really complicated for me , it seems totally different from solidity

&rey: Probably there is some error when you read that dict. (reply to 25102)

&rey: Most probably, you read fields in incorrect order (I think this is the most popular error) üòÄ

√ñ: You mean on the contract side? (reply to 25106)

&rey: Yes. Serialization of dict looks correct. (reply to 25107)

√ñ: Actually, savedata doesn't get dict. It's set in the contract. This is the savedata: save_data(positive, negative, veto, abstain, contract_time_of_deployment);

√ñ: And in contract, it sets the dict like this: (_, int flag) = checker.dict_get?(267, sender_address);   if flag {     return ();   }    ;;  Add to the dictionary if the address does not match   checker~dict_set(267, sender_address, "");

Coalus: Try tact-lang.org (reply to 25104)

√ñ: What may be the problem with the contract? (reply to 25108)

Berke: Not sure which code u are talking about bur errors might be a response on web side even if its an error on chain side (reply to 25177)

Berke: You will probably find error code on tx in the explorer

a: How did we calculate the 267 value here?

a: I have found a repo that uses the specific function that you have given and it seems to be using 8+256 in the same function.

a: How to calculate this on contract side as well as the testing side?

E: I havent seen inheritance in FunC smart contract development. Any information? If there is a way to extend an already existing smart contract code.

E: So that the extended smart contract is a single smart contract, and its consumers can see the extension clearly knowing the famous and standard base contract (class). I can do it by doing save as and add code.

Howard: Is there a Telegram bot for searching? I am looking for a tool that can analyze when people leave groups  or not and highlight what others were discussing at the time.

User<689845327>: Hi,  I have a question about minting NFT with ton-connect.  Do I need a backend program to send the data to blockchain and mint it? For example, WebApp > Ton-connect: send data with Ton-Proof > Backend makes the data package > Ton wallet approve the Tx of minting NFT > Ton blockchain makes the NFT > Ton blockchain deposit the NFT to the wallet.  Am I right? Or it‚Äôs not how it works? Thanks.

&rey: You can make data package on frontend. (reply to 25284)

User<689845327>: So actaully,  The logic may like:  WebApp: bundle the data of NFT and ask Ton-connect to send with Ton-Proof > Ton wallet approve the Tx of minting NFT > Ton blockchain makes the NFT > Ton blockchain deposit the NFT to the wallet.  However, if I want to bundle the  data and store to the server and mint NFT later. I need backend absolutely? (reply to 25285)

&rey: If you want to mint NFT later, you may send a message of minimal value carrying its data so that it's recorded in blockchain (not forever because transactions are not guaranteed to be kept for a long time), then later on frontend you can check such messages and mint NFTs when the time has come. However, you also need to lock minting until specific time in some way. (reply to 25286)

User<1460963135>: Minting if simple tx you even can prepare deeplink to send it. Where u want prepare and send from wallet app

User<689845327>: One more thing. If I want to mint an NFT that follows my own contract. This doesn‚Äôt change the logic right?  I mean, when the user decided a data that changes the features of the contract, the WebApp can use Ton-Proof to bundle the data and mint without backend? (reply to 25287)

User<689845327>: bundle the data and send with Ton-Proof* ^ Please correct me if I made mistake

&rey: You don't need ton-proof to send anything, you need just connection to wallet app. (reply to 25290)

User<1460963135>: read docs about nft again. it covers all your questions and your base knowledge missing too much.

User<689845327>: Because our engineer said, it‚Äôs impossible to make a custom NFT without backend.

User<1460963135>: You paying him not us. And give backend access to my wallet to mint nft is nonsense too. Why you talking about that proof. No understanding how it works but wanna operate?

User<689845327>: Even the NFT contract is different?

User<1460963135>: Short answer u engineer wrong. Long at docs. backend is http api of node.

User<689845327>: As I know, we have to use Ton Proof to verify user‚Äôs identity? and minting the NFT needs to ask the approval of the user.

&rey: Backend is often useful, however it's only required if you need to hold some private keys there, for example to sign NFT minting request. There certainly are custom contracts which don't require backend for operating. See https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ratelance/ for example. (reply to 25293)

User<1460963135>: no. U event dont  need to login with connect or smth

&rey: You don't need to verify user's identity if you want him to mint NFT by his own. (reply to 25297)

User<689845327>: Thanks. I‚Äôm reading. (reply to 25298)

User<689845327>: Ah‚Ä¶ So after connected the wallet. We can mint the NFT directly? (reply to 25300)

User<1460963135>: why to connect wallet for what?

&rey: It's often inconvenient to communicate this link to device with wallet app except than via QR codes. (reply to 25308)

User<1460963135>: ok but you don't need it to understand how it works. to avoid such a situation when tying to take full access of user's wallet to send tx from it. like this guy.

User<1460963135>: if you sending tx from back you mint it from own wallet, not user's and where is ton connect in this scheme?

User<689845327>: Thanks @pcrafter & @commonbabylightmyfire  I need time to review the doc but I think I got the idea that how to fix.   Thanks again//

Howard: You can push the data to the chain through a URL and then send it using TonKeeper (Wallet).    Essentially, the data you mentioned here is meant for mining purposes and will be pasted to a smart contract like EVM. How you implement your code will determine if this is possible or not.  If you want to mint an NFT in the TON network, you should know that each NFT has a unique contract address and is signed with the owner's address. That's all. (reply to 25289)

Owdares: hello, can you tell me what information the owner of a public node can get if a transaction is sent through it?

User<1460963135>: using http api - same as another webserver but api is not node itself

Owdares: that is, the owners of the nodes can receive the private key with which the transaction was signed?

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Can we say that implementing this TEP-89 in Jetton is now mandatory? from Howard  Can we say that implementing this TEP-89 in Jetton is now mandatory?   https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md  üîó Answer on TON Overflow

Howard: You can write a TypeScript file to fetch on-chain data. For example, you can refer to this GitHub repository:  https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts/tree/main/packages/contracts https://github.com/toncenter/examples.  Please note that it is not reliable to call a get_method from Contract B in your Contract A for an asynchronous blockchain. The best approach is to use message receive to ask Contract B to return its status. (reply to 25347)

m√†t√≠n: () recv_internal(slice in_msg_body) impure { throw_if(35,in_msg_body.slice_bits() < 32);  int n = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);  slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();  int total = ds~load_uint(64);  total += n;  set_data(begin_cell().store_uint(total, 64).end_cell());}  int get_total() method_id {  slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();  int total = ds~load_uint(64);   return total; }  I have a question about TVM and smart contracts, for instance, here we only have one variable (total) what happens if we have another var like (id) how does TVM understand that I have another var, and how does it separate two or more same type variables with different value?

User<5906393387>: You store data and specifying number of bits.  Then, when you get the data from the c4 register (slicing data), you use load methods with specifying the amount of bits that you want to get.  If you store 64 bits of total and 64 bits of id and you want to get id variable, you just load first 64 bits to skip total variable and load another 64 bits to get the id var. (reply to 25351)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: TVM doesn't have variable names, it uses stack position instead (just as every compiled code like c/c++/c#) (reply to 25351)

m√†t√≠n: so the order of storing is important?

E: 1. First, name the method get_counter() rather than counter() to obey convention: 2. Make a wrapper interface called Counter.ts in Typescript. and add the following method.    async getCounter(provider: ContractProvider) {         const result = await provider.get('get_counter', []);         return result.stack.readNumber();     } (reply to 25347)

E: Notice that the  method_id modifier allows you to call the getter function from Typescript code using the following method and passing the Func getter method name as string key prameter: await provider.get('get_counter', []);         return result.stack.readNumber(); Explained very well in https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials/02-contract/ . Go to step 9. (reply to 25358)

E: In your case if the get methods name is counter() then the typescript caller would be    async getCounter(provider: ContractProvider) {     const { stack } = await provider.get("counter", []);     return stack.readBigNumber();   }

E: And then you would call this interface getCouter method as follows in your Typescript code:  import { getHttpEndpoint } from "@orbs-network/ton-access"; import { TonClient, Address } from "ton"; import Counter from "./counter"; // this is the interface class we just implemented  async function main() {   // initialize ton rpc client on testnet   const endpoint = await getHttpEndpoint({ network: "testnet" });   const client = new TonClient({ endpoint });    // open Counter instance by address   const counterAddress = Address.parse("EQBYLTm4nsvoqJRvs_L-IGNKwWs5RKe19HBK_lFadf19FUfb"); // replace with your address from step 8   const counter = new Counter(counterAddress);   const counterContract = client.open(counter);    // call the getter on chain   const counterValue = await counterContract.getCounter();   console.log("value:", counterValue.toString()); }  main();

User<5906393387>: Yes, so you can read in that order (reply to 25357)

E: Hey guys, I am working on two related TEPs as an extension to TEP-74 and TEP-62. TEPs are about Lockable Fungible Tokens Standard and Lockable NFT Standard. It is revolutionary in a sense that it relies on the asynchronous system of TVM where each Jetton wallet is a distinct contract. We have atomicity within a wallet and not among wallets. This allowed us to introduce a class of transactions with a robust scheme that do not need consensus despite changing state. It increases speed, security, while decreasing costs incredibly for some DAPP use cases that involve staking.  Please kindly check the early draft out at https://web3-4.gitbook.io/daoton/lockable-token-standard  I am working on the TEP at the moment  and would be happy to get feedback.

Andrey: It's very bad practice to mess with the c4 cell directly.  It will not lead to anything good, especially when we want a lot of new smart contracts and users.  I believe it is possible not to support everyone who has not implemented the method in the contract for the compatibility with custom smart contracts. I heard it's not that hard to get a wallet with working methods. (reply to 25383)

Tim: good luck with telling every user in support to change his wallet

Seitaro: 1. It is unclear do we really need a standard for this? Isn't it just internal implementation details of jetton-DAO system. 2. Indeed, to forbid double voting you need to be able to lock jettons from transfers. But also you need to prevent voting from the same wallet twice somehow. It is unclear how you do that. 3. Nikita Kuznetsov from OpenMask well thought out this concept of DAO, I made my own half-baked implementation here, not ready for production but can be used as proof-of-concept. (reply to 25363)
