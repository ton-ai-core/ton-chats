Dario: Hello

qpwe: Hi ü•∞

Dario: I need help, i dont understand a thing about fungible tokens. Where is the check of who deployed a "token wallet"? cant i just deploy a "custom" wallet with fake balance and hack the protocol? (im talking about this line       equal_slices(calc_user_wallet(from, jetton_master, token_wallet_code), sender) )

Tunis: Are tonkeeper app and TON Wallet extensions Bip39 compliant?   I tried to use valid 24 word mnemonics from my usual wallets, but it is impossible to initialize tonkeeper/TON Wallet.

Tunis: Example: I created valid bip39 compliant 24 word mnemonic with https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ and tried to use it on https://wallet.ton.org/ - no success!  Mnemonic: ketchup permit cluster soon decrease sad soldier cram pretty carbon kit assault lizard seat plug upset rely best travel swallow crater knee chunk manual

Slava: A seed generation works differently in TON.

Tunis: It is not good on my opinion - I want to use one wallet for different cryptocurrencies - but in case of TON it is impossible - I need to use at leat two wallets - one for TON and another wallet for all other cryptocurrencies.

Slava: What do you mean by "wallet"?

Tunis: it looks like that seed hash generation differs - last word in mnemonic

Tunis: I mean here - wallet = "one mnemonic phrase"

Slava: So you would like to input the same seed phrase (from e.g. Ethereum) to any TON wallet software and be able to use it?

Tunis: yes - it is common bip39 standart for cryptocurrecies

Tunis: one mnemonic - different derivation pathes for different cryptocurrencies

Slava: Well, I don't believe it would be feasible.

Tunis: yes, it will broke compatibility with current implementation

Slava: HD wallets are also not implemented in TON.

Ilya Mikheev: You could try and manipulate the used phrase so it would fit the TON version, but idk how you could do that

Slava: Yeah, I feel for you. But it's too late to change that. (reply to 167)

Slava: A new key generation standard would be needed for TON to become compatible with these standards.

Slava: Have you tried to use seed phrase generated by TON in Ethereum?

Tunis: the seed for TON and BIP39 differs with last word only - the last word it is like to hash (checksum).

Tunis: hash checksum

Slava: Yeah, right. It won't work then.

Anton: Ton uses a subset of bip39, therefore Ton-generated mnemonics should work fine with bip39 currencies but not the other way around

Tunis: no, it is not, I tried to use TON mnemo in https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ - it says "Invalid mnemonic"

Anton: Incorrect, all words of the mnemonic phrase are random. Difference is that some of such bip39 phrases are rejected by ton, so that if a user misses one word his mnemonic will be rejected (reply to 174)

Anton: Yep, my bad. Ton doesn't have this hash the thing and append to the end of entropy step (reply to 179)

Anton: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic/blob/2ee9b677230c58598c28b00a0e53a4e1f9f043ef/src/functions/generate-mnemonic.ts#L18 it simply tries random phrases until one satisfies IsBasicSeed

Tunis: I'll made test in few days - I'll generate 23 word mnemo and then I'll try to pick up last word - there are 2048 combinations - I'll try to check if there are any intersection between correct BIP39 mnemonics and correct TON mnemonics.

Anton: This most likely won't work as IsBasicSeed check has an underlying PBKDF2 computation. On average it takes about eh 200-500 attempts of checking random phrases to generate a correct one for ton

Tunis: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki Generating the mnemonic  The mnemonic must encode entropy in a multiple of 32 bits. With more entropy security is improved but the sentence length increases. We refer to the initial entropy length as ENT. The allowed size of ENT is 128-256 bits.  First, an initial entropy of ENT bits is generated. A checksum is generated by taking the first  ENT / 32  bits of its SHA256 hash. This checksum is appended to the end of the initial entropy. Next, these concatenated bits are split into groups of 11 bits, each encoding a number from 0-2047, serving as an index into a wordlist. Finally, we convert these numbers into words and use the joined words as a mnemonic sentence. The following table describes the relation between the initial entropy length (ENT), the checksum length (CS), and the length of the generated mnemonic sentence (MS) in words.  .......

Tunis: 24 word mnemo it is 256 bit entropy

Slava: Try this in TON wallet and in Metamask:   1. rigid  2. practice  3. sugar  4. negative  5. grape  6. cotton  7. mixed  8. hair  9. mercy 10. party 11. oxygen 12. mix 13. potato 14. exclude 15. crash 16. frog 17. private 18. fish 19. phrase 20. purchase 21. brush 22. soldier 23. add 24. huge  üòâ

Tunis: Yes, it fits both - TON and BIP39 standart. But it may by insecure to create such mnemonics - because it decreases entropy =)

Tunis: I'll try to undestand on how much entropy are decreased in case of such mnemonics

Slava: It selects one mnemonic out of 246 declined.

Tunis: Something similar with BIP39 - for 24 word mnemonic there are only 8 valid mnemonics for case:      "23 initial words" + one last word from bip39 dictionary (2048 words)  Example - for "23 x art" there are only 8 bip39 compatible valid mnemonics (2040 declined): 1. 23 x art advance 2. 23 x art cost 3. 23 x art enroll 4. 23 x art junk 5. 23 x art mushroom 6. 23 x art pool 7. 23 x art slender 8. 23 x art wine but no one of them are valid for TON)

Tunis: 2048 words in the dictionary -> 11 bits of entropy 11 * 24 (words in mnemonic) = 264. The 8 additional bits are a checksum.

Anton: Well from a security standpoint using the same mnemonic phrase for multiple currencies is a bad idea no matter what the entropy is like ‚ò†Ô∏è

Tunis: It is, but bip39 standart was made to simplify life with wallets and different cryptocurrencies.

Anton: Welcome to TON, we're not looking for easy ways here ;)

Anton: This has been discussed https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic/issues/13

TON technical overview: No, since wallet trusts incoming message only from other wallet. Indeed when your wallet sends to my wallet some tokens it also sends me your address. I recalculate address of your wallet and then compare address of your wallet with address from which message came. If they are equal it means that message was sent by authentic code and my wallet knows that this message can only be generated by authentic code if it decrease it's own balance. (reply to 136)

TON technical overview: If some other contract sends to my wallet message which try to mimic to incoming jettons it will fail to pass the check

Dario: Yeah, i saw that, it hash the cell. Is this enough to gauranteed that the wallet is trusted? (reply to 204)

Dario: There is no way to hack it?

TON technical overview: Yes (under condition that wallet can not change it's code, but wallet knows whether it can or not) (reply to 206)

Dario: So if i deploy a token with upgradable code (with set_code, right?) by wallet owner The token can be hacked? (reply to 208)

TON technical overview: Well, look, you can not deploy token with upgradable code by will. Since address is determined by initial code, not by current. I just want to point that if wallet is developed right (without set_code) it can not be hacked. However if developer make a mistake or may be try to use set_code in some limited way, he should be extra cautious (reply to 211)

Dario: Okay,got it. Thanks (reply to 212)

Slava: I've discussed this problem with the lead TON developers and we've reached the following consensus: it is OK from the cryptography standpoint to use TON-compatible BIP39 seed phrases for TON, however, this will violate general security practices, because one leaked/broken seed phrase would compromise all of your wallets in multiple networks. We still recommend to use unique seed phrases for all the different wallets. (reply to 189)

Tunis: @slavafomin   It is a bit different:   - If user want's more security he can create separate mnemonic for each cryptocurrency - user can decide to do so if he want.   - If user want's to use one mnemonic for all cryptocurrencies - he can use it - but except TON.   From the user experience, it is not good to decide for the user whether to use a different mnemonic or not.  Native BIP39 support in TON may simplify integration of TON in different crypto wallets like to Trust Wallet, Coinomi, and so on ...  On my opinion, this could be a tactical advantage for the future of TON.

Slava: That's yet another question. This will require TON community to update all the wallet software created so far to get full support of existing BIP39 seed phrases. (reply to 220)

Slava: > Native BIP39 support in TON may simplify integration of TON in different crypto wallets like to Trust Wallet, Coinomi, and so on ...  > On my opinion, this could be a tactical advantage for the future of TON.  By the way, what difficulties do you see in TON integration currently? (reply to 220)

Slava: In other words, how exactly BIP39 support will simplify things?

Tunis: Bip39 is the basis for other standarts:       "BIP39, the standard defines how seed phrases are made. ..."  There a lot of other related standarts - BIP32/BIP43/BIP44/...  Let's look at BIP44 (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0044):      This BIP defines a logical hierarchy for deterministic wallets ...     ...     We define the following 5 levels in BIP32 path:     m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index  The BIP44 are the basis for multi-currency and multi-acoount wallets.  If TON will support it (BIP39), it may be much easily to integrate TON coin to those wallets.   There are a lot of popular multi-currency and multi-acoount wallets - and all of them are based on those BIP standarts.

Slava: HD wallets are yet another question :)  And I don't think that it directly relates to BIP39. (reply to 229)

Tunis: yes) but seed generation are based on bip39 for those wallets

Slava: I guess BIP32 will work with TON seeds as well.

Tunis: It will work - but TON doesn't supports BIP39. As result we have here that BIP39 mnemonics are basically not suitable for TON - there are present some exclusions - but it doesn't resolves the problem.

Tunis: Popular multi-currency and multi-account wallets are based on BIP39 seeds.

TEP: Does anyone know can we make Token under Ton Coin?

RocketMan: there is draft of standard, but it is not approved yet (reply to 237)

RocketMan: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/74

RocketMan: you can read here

TEP: Thanks (reply to 240)

Dario: Well, still, it doesn't make any sense. With this implementation, there cant be a swap or a dex. If the address is generated by the a wallet address, the pool contract cant know which address he control. So there is need of two call, the first needed to create a wallet for pool, the second for letting know the pool which address he control. And due to asynchronous of the Blockchain, this cant be trusted and can lead to security issues (reply to 212)

Dario: Maybe im missing something, but as long there is no "create_wallet" (internal message) its kinda hard to work with

TON technical overview: Dex will know the address of his wallet during first time it gets tokens (reply to 246)

Dario: No, the address doesn't receive anything (reply to 248)

Dario: The coin will be sent to another address, not to the addess of a certain pool

TON technical overview: There is optional notification for the owner upon token receiving

Dario: Mh

Dario: Okay will check

Dario: Talking about a liquidity pool, there could be discrepancies with a/b pair plus this can be a serious problem with slippage

Dario: Well with notification this can be done

TON technical overview: Dex-pool, during creation still should get the addresses of the corresponding token-wallets. If somebody create pool with wrong wallet address (non-wallet) it should be marked as 'unverified/scam' the same way as if somevody create DAI token himself and deploy pair. (reply to 255)

Dario: Still, this can lead to errors (reply to 256)

Dario: For example; i create a dex. The Factory deploy a pool for a/b, and a malicious actor send a fake transaction to initialize the pool with a wrong wallet address. Due to hashing system, i won't be able to deploy another pool contract for that pair

·Ö†: What is the meaning of this error that pops up on Desktop wallet? It's not very user friendly! It comes up soon after starting the wallet, not when doing anything with it in particular.

Dario: As long the contract can be updated (unsecure, means that someonr control it)

TON technical overview: Well, as I see that with correct flow, you are not deploying pair-pool for A/B token, instead you deploy pair-pool between wallet-A and wallet-B. In this case UI should check validity and authenticity of wallet-A and wallet-B and after that checks user can be sure that everything is ok. (reply to 259)

Dario: Oh, understand. Seems logic, i need to change the code again ahah (reply to 263)

User<5172397748>: Hi, Do you think it would be possible for you (TON Dev) to enter in contact with Koinly.io dev (an app that help us to do our tax incomes for crypto miner or crypto trader)? This app can keep track of all our transaction when we provide them our public crypto adress on a specific blockchain, but the probleme is that TONCOIN use his own blockchain and it's not supported (yet?) on koinly.io. Could you enter in contact with them so they implement your blockchain on their app? At this moment we have to enter manually each transaction of Toncoin on Koinly.io (by entering the amount and the hour we made the transaction), and they add the value in $ of each transaction base on coinmarketcap for this specific hour. But as a Toncoin Miner, I get income multiple time each day, so it's a real hassle to add those transaction in Koinly.io each time. With Ethereum by exemple, Koinly.io see automatically all transaction that were made so I don't have to enter anything beside my public ETH address and all my tax summary can be automated.  I already contacted Koinly.io about this, they are not against, they even put Toncoin as available crypto-currency on the platform, so at least when I enter a transaction they can track how much it was worth in $ at this specific moment, but if you could work with them to make the link between their app and your blockchain it would be great!

Slava: Hey!  As a user of this service, you should make clear to them that TON integration is desired. It would be better if you would have a community of other miners to back you up. TON is the open platform, so I don't see any problems for their engineers to implement the integration. Also, I'm sure that TON community would be glad to help them if their engineers would have some specific questions. This chat was created specifically for this purpose. (reply to 278)

User<5172397748>: Unfortunately the only miners I know dont declare their income üòÇ so I cant ask them to promotr this idea ü§ê

Slava: This is also an opportunity for you to create such service for TON or a third-party plugin/integration for the service you use. (reply to 281)

User<5172397748>: I dont have competence for this

Slava: You can always partner up with somebody ;) (reply to 283)

Amir Ali: Hi

Amir Ali: How can I sent ton coin using only python?

Dario: Is there any call to get the contract address inside it? I cant find anything like that in tvm

Dario: Wrap fift cli and use standard fift scripts for wallet (reply to 362)

Amir Ali: no idea what you just saidüòÖ (reply to 366)

Dario: Im kinda dumb there is MYADDR (reply to 363)

Amir Ali: are (reply to 371)

Dario: Basically you can interact with wallet creating transactions. To make one, you need to run a cli command like "./fift -s wallet.fif ..." And stuff. So you can wrap that and use it in python to send transaction. You should also make two http request, the first to get the seqno of your own wallet and the second to upload the transaction to thr network (its a boc file, you need to read it and base64encode it). Everything can be done using toncenter api (reply to 368)

Amir Ali: wow nice (reply to 373)

Amir Ali: Do you also have any github project in this regard? (reply to 373)

Dario: I dont think so, i made.my own script in PHP for my projects (reply to 375)

Amir Ali: ah cool

Dario: Well its kinda easy to do that, just grab a fift compiler and make some tests with official scripts

Dario: Hello, sorry for being annoying, i have another question. Talking about the swap,  let assume that an user send some token to the "dex address" with a payload, so the wallet receive an update and send the notification to "dex address". Now, the dex create a pool contract with the walletA and.. walletB? How can i know which wallet belong to the dex address for b token? (reply to 263)

Dario: Also, i cant send two token with one transaction, so it doesn't make too much sense.   I guess the standard should should add the possibility to use the master jetton contract to make payments as a proxy

Dario: I cant even let users send two transactions to initialize "pool contract" because that would be untrusted. there is no way to let users to create  pairs

User<1029195636>: Hello, I know someone who lost their TON doing the ether bridge swap, can someone help?

User<2050578895>: Hi

TON technical overview: Looks like that when you create pool between walletA and walletB you don't need to send both tokens, you can just create empty pool. Then asymmetrical deposits of liquidity are trivial, symmetric one is more interesting: there are a couple ways including special deposit intermediate contracts or account system for users, etc (reply to 392)

Emilia: Hi, may I ask some technical questions here?

User<1370269970>: Hi, yep.

p: @tondev (reply to 421)

Purple: https://t.me/tondev

Dario: Yeah i will try to do everything symmetric, i think i will need at least 4 contract (reply to 411)

Dario: Or maybe i will move to an order based dex, which is more easy to build

Dario: The swap is kinda hard to do, due to ton architecture

Ruslan: i send transaction by the api(https://toncenter.com/api/v2/sendBoc), but the api doesn't return the transaction hash for me. so i want to kown how can i get transaction hash by the data from returned api(https://toncenter.com/api/v2/sendBoc) (forwarded from zz)

Emilia: Hi, I've been following TON from the beginning since the Telegram days. I would like to get some information that I could not find on the whitepaper and primer. 1) What is the average transaction fee? 2) Are workchains implemented? The roadmap says 50% and that they can be up to 2^32. 3) What is the current and maximum throughput (tps) for masterchain and workchains? 4) What are the transaction finalization values? Number of blocks and block time? 5) What is the amount of TONs that will actually come into circulation out of the total 5 billion (currently 1.22 billion)? In the original draft of Telegram the breakdown was: 52% (2.6 billion) TON reserve, 4% (0.2 billion) developers and 46% (2.2 billion) public. Thank you (reply to 417)

Please submit questions in advance to @tonicadmin on Telegram.   Link to conference is here. (Conference in in English). Use this link to add the event to your Google Calendar.

·Ö†: Hi Ilya. I don't understand why not use Telegram many of us don‚Äôt have or like Zoom and Telegram does video with screen sharing too nor why the Ton Foundation Telegram ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù (which by the way blocked me permanently without warning and without violating any rules within seconds of joining in December and simply posting a helpful reply to a question and there‚Äôs no recourse no admins to contact it‚Äôs like Stalinist dictatorship which leaves a very bitter taste to a new Ton investor) promotes Twitter for Telegram users instead of promoting Telegram to the Twitter audience, and why they promote the Medium censorship platform instead of promoting Telegraph. Half of the battle for the mass adoption of TON is to attract people to Telegram? (reply to 452)

User<1029195636>: I agree, I don't like Zoom and frankly I do not trust them at all, if we can step away from them that would be great (reply to 453)

I: Hi! I can't speak for the foundation, but I can speak for Tonic. Zoom is a more fully feautured tool for video conferences, that's the reason we chose it. Quite simple. (reply to 453)

RocketMan: you will not get hash from here  hash and lt will be when transaction will be added to block by validators (reply to 523)

RocketMan: basically there are two ways to check if transaction successfully sent  first is to check seqno of wallet (if it is incremented)

RocketMan: second is to check address for transaction

Andrey: Hi!  We are glad to announce our new (v0.0.22) release of toncli with a lot of features.  The main ones are:  1. Func tests, you can play with an example here 2. Windows Support 3. A new send command that allows you to send Internal messages from fif files to other smart contracts 4. The ability to send messages / make requests to get methods directly to the address of contracts --address "....." 5. The ability to parse the output of get methods via fift, even if there is a slice or cell 6. A lot of fixes 7. Automatic restart of the lite-client if it could not connect to the server during the process 8. The ability to connect ownnet. You can create one with toncenter using the example of ton-k8s (compose images are available) 9. The --data-params parameter to which arguments can be passed before the contract is deployed (for example, if you have a contract of 1, and there are many different data (nft üëÄ ))  Many other features, but they were not recorded ;)  Unfortunately, to update, you need to suffer a little and merge ~/.config/toncli, it's easier to dump all the keys for ~/.config/toncli/wallet and delete the entire folder to create a new one.

Dario: Question for toly-, ehm, ton-wallet devs: how do you plan to deal with signing message from a dapp? as it is now, an user cant easly recognize if a dapp is trusted or not, the signing process just show the hex of the message so nobody can tell if the message is going to swap tokena for tokenb or just drain all founds .

Dario: maybe a better wallet smart contract with administration rules and so on would be useful, so a dapp would install his plugin which specify what the dapp can do (move ton, move tokens, move nft) and the only interactions can be done via that plugin

User<1227371993>: Can I have some heads up please? Is the function recv_internal required to have certain arguments or it's completely up to what you want the message sender to send you? I've noticed some funC programs have signature int msg_value, cell in_msg_cell, slice in_msg while others only have slice in_msg.

TON technical overview: Please check https://ton.org/docs/#/smart-contracts/tvm_overview?id=initialization-of-tvm  So there are always 4 arguments on stack when recv_internal is called. By declaring recv_internal with less than 4 arguments you force funC to ignore most deep variables (they still will be there, but your code will be unaware for the whole TVM execution). (reply to 1072)

Amin: Hi, Does store_slice act like store_ref? For example, If I use store_slice at sending side, and at receiving side use load_ref and begin_parse would it be fine? I'm trying to understand the underlaying logic of slice and cell. If not, what's the most efficient way to store slice as ref?

TON technical overview: No store_slice is function applied to (builder, slice) and it adds slice bits to builder bits and adds slice refs to builder refs. While store_ref is function applied to (builder, cell) and it adds cell to builder' refs.  >what's the most efficient way to store slice as ref? there is no 'very efficient ways'.  builder.store_ref(begin_cell().store_slice(slice).end_cell()) will do the thing, but usually trick is to somehow by-pass creation of extra cell. (reply to 1075)

Amin: Thanks, I got it (reply to 1076)

User<1227371993>: Thank you. So, if my understanding is correct, smart contracts are programmed in FunC, compiled into Fift and have to be deployed on the blockchain - and you can later interact with them using Fift or a wrapper SDK. Is that right? (reply to 1074)

TON technical overview: yes (reply to 1079)

TON technical overview: Looks like UQCzwxqIw1pt41DND9pgGfAOhJKtQQEgjVcpn0rHxv-4b8Ob resides in basechain (workchain=0) but you are looking transactions in masterchain (workchain=-1). https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getBlockTransactions?workchain=0&shard=-9223372036854775808&seqno=21407484 returns required tx (reply to 1371)

Tolya: Clarification of the 4th task of the FunC contest https://github.com/ton-blockchain/func-contest1/commit/169e901582675708d9cbc07796314fea9f2c31f6

Ruslan: 1. Your transaction is not in workchain=-1.  - After lookupBlock find all shards: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=16512830. - For block you‚Äôve found and for each shard get transactions list. You‚Äôll find your transaction in the block (workchain=0, shard=-9223372036854775808, seqno=21407484). (reply to 1371)

I: Can I deploy smart contract to MyLocalTon?

I: Also, how to connect MyLocalTon using TonWeb?

Daniil: Hi. What does fee_recipient mean in the nft collection file?

Slava: I guess you will need to install your own instance of the TonCenter and configure it to use your local TON network config, so it could connect to your LS. After that you can configure TonWeb to connect to your local TonCenter and deploy contracts with it. (reply to 1380)

Dario: How can I get public key from friendly text address? tonweb

Dario: nvm, look like i can do  a.hashPart

TON technical overview: It is not public key, it is hash part. You can get public key by calling get_public_key get method. (reply to 1413)

Dario: Oh okay thanks (reply to 1415)

Dario: wait, thats not what i need. i want to parse a string address to uint8array(32) rapresenting the pubkey (reply to 1415)

TON technical overview: In TON account address and public key (something paired to some private key) are not strictly linked. Contract may have no public key at all. Wallet smart-contracts have public key, it can be retrieved by get_public_key (reply to 1417)

Dario: i know, but im trying to do something different so i need help to parse a txt address to pubkey bytes (reply to 1420)

Dario: look like it can be done via  TonWeb.utils.hexToBytes("HEX");

Step: why there is always only one shard in masterchain for any seqno? for example https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getMasterchainInfo gives seqno 19586270 then https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=19586270  gives {"ok":true,"result":{"@type":"blocks.shards","shards":[{"@type":"ton.blockIdExt","workchain":0,"shard":"-9223372036854775808","seqno":24705898,"root_hash":"WO/lwsDncDa6/EgStxNc+EIho0qGLYfRD6p3tD3A5dY=","file_hash":"fsv3DAqh3NbHMJ1/SUUsYS0uNO9jofgaQWV2QxB9rXs="}],"@extra":"1649164901.0717678:1:0.10214953529318616"}} (reply to 1377)

Ruslan: In the future it will be more than one.

Slava: Shards are used for network scalability. The network is using one shard at the moment.

TON technical overview: There is about 2 tx per second in TON currently, one shard is able to  process around 100 tps and start to split to subshards around this value. So there is not enough load for many shards. There were actually 16 shards prior 9m blocks (due to global split params) and also some spam events as well.

Step: ok understood.

Step: usdt is available in TON?

TON technical overview: To elucidate fine details the additional clarifications were added: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/func-contest1/commit/6b6e0cbdafc10e377154ea96631c6933b3ff851d Bot for submissions will be announced tomorrow.

Aidan: Hi all I am trying to pull all mining history from PoW Giver 1 and am running the following (python) code:  METHOD = 'getTransactions' url = f'https://api.ton.sh/{METHOD}?address=Ef-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprKDH&page=1' headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"} response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers) json_blob = json.loads(response.text)   However when I try and change the page number (i.e. 2, 3, etc.), I am still only getting recent 10 tx's from this week. Have read the docs but am not sure what I am missing. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Aidan: Ah seems logical time == blocks

‚Äî 2022-04-06 ‚Äî

Slava: Hey. Where did you find the page parameter? (reply to 1447)

Aidan: Didn't see on docs so I improvised... doesn't seem to be working... Trying to get all tx's for a given account. From what I can gather the best way to do this is to pull the most recent ones and then use set the earliest logical time to the latest logical time for the next batch... However this seems like a hacky way to do it.  Would you have any recommendations sir? Currently reading newer whitepaper from 2021 but no mention of logical timee (reply to 1454)

Slava: It's actually right in the documentation :)  The cursor is controlled by these two parameters.

Slava: Just get these two properties from the last transaction in a batch and query for the next one.

Aidan: Ahh. 1) isn't hash unique to tx so couldn't be used to ID next? 2) i thought I could start at lt = 0 and work my way up but with API is limit is 10 so I wasn't sure how to get all tx's where they have the same lt but there are more than 10 of them

Aidan: That led me to https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/transactions/get_transactions_getTransactions_get

Aidan: No limit (or seems to cover up to 1000 per request), more requests, and had to_lt field

Slava: The key point here as that you get recent results and scan to the past.

Aidan: Yes but what if there are more than 10 tx's for a given lt?

Aidan: Usually API has page and offset params to deal with this if limit is insufficient

Aidan: Forgive me if I'm missing something here, currently making way through whitepaper

Slava: Address, LT and hash are three parameters that uniquely identify a transaction in TON. Essentially, you are using last received transaction as a cursor to get the next ones.

Slava: You should Google for cursor based pagination. Offset based pagination has its flaws.

Slava: Yes, TonCenter would be a more advanced solution. Be advised, that you will need to get the API token for it though. (reply to 1461)

Aidan: Thank you - reading about it...  So is the most efficient way to start at lt = 0 and work way up to latest lt? (26864278000001)  Feel like 30 calls/min rate limit will make this slow and even if, I see a path to getting all tx's for a given lt, new request with latest tx_hash and lt as starting point.

Aidan: Thank you - happy to pay for one but where can I get it? https://toncenter.com/ I messaged the bot to get one but no reply (reply to 1469)

Slava: I don't think that you will be able to start from LT = 0. You will start from recent transactions and will go to the past.

Slava: It's free and unlimited at the moment. However the limits will be implemented very soon. (reply to 1471)

Aidan: Also, sir can I DM you or would you prefer to keep chat here? Don't want to clog up for others

Aidan: I can see path to working forward but not backward... as tx and lt are where to start

Slava: However, you can install your own copy of TonCenter. It would be a better solution if you need to do historical scans.

Slava: The API will return the results in backward direction, starting from the most recent transactions and going into the past. (reply to 1476)

Slava: That's a little counter intuitive, but that's how it works.

Aidan: I got you but if it goes backward and I can input lt and hash for starting points, one can guess the lt that comes before, but not the hash that comes before no?

Slava: By the way, I'm not sure if ton.sh will return you the entire history of transactions, it could be limited to more recent ones.

Slava: You don't guess it. You take these parameters from the last item in the batch. (reply to 1480)

Aidan: Oooo

Aidan: So even though the documentation says starting I can think of it like starting but facing in a backwards direction (i.e. starting newest --> oldest)? I am thinking of starting going forwards (i.e. oldest --> newest) and based off what your saying think have to shift paradigm

Slava: Yep, that's right.

Slava: That's what I've said above :) (reply to 1479)

Aidan: Ah thank you... wanted to confirm

Aidan: Appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me! üôè

Slava: No problem, good luck )

Slava: If you would have any questions regarding TON development you can always ask here.

Aidan: Will do! I am very much enjoying whitepaper - kudos to u and team for work you are doing and appreciate your responsiveness

Aidan: GN

ej: Is there anyone help me with ton nft on getgems?

RocketMan: what do you mean? (reply to 1499)

ej: I want to know how to submit NFT project on it but there is no create project option like what we see on opensea.com (reply to 1500)

RocketMan: you want to mint or simply add to catalogue? (reply to 1501)

ej: Both can be my option. (reply to 1502)

RocketMan: you cannot mint on getgems now. only catalogue functions avalable.   the only place where you can mint your nfts now is disintar.io  you can add your project to getgems catalogue via bot I guess (reply to 1504)

ej: Do you know the bot adress

RocketMan: press "submit my collection"

ej: So who are those already minted their project

RocketMan: they all minted via another marketplace (reply to 1508)

RocketMan: disintar.io

ej: Thanks  But for the "submit" you mean on http://disintar.io  Or  getgems.io Or  Bot

ej: Because on getgems.ii there is no submit option

RocketMan: soooo, let's start from the beginning  the current state of marketplaces on TON is the following:  there is first marketplace, disintar. There you can mint individual NFT via site interface (not collection). Or contact them and send files of collection. They will mint collection then for you. All collections which are already minted, went this way. As far as I know, they preparing UI now for minting collections too.  also there is second marketplace, getgems. This marketplace is not ready yet, so only thing you can do is contact them via bot and ask to put your collection in catalogue. but you cannot mint, buy or sell yet.

Andrey: 100% make sense (reply to 1530)

Vyacheslav Flok: Hello guys, I need your help.  I don‚Äôt understand a concept of ¬´contract balance¬ª and ¬´message balance¬ª from the documentation https://ton.org/docs/#/smart-contracts/tvm_overview?id=initialization-of-tvm  I understand what is ¬´balance¬ª in common life. Like a bank account balance. The amount of funds that I have accumulated and which I can spend to something. But what is message balance? I suppose that it is a max limit of grams that i can place in store_grams() function. Am I correct?  If so, what the difference with contract balance?

TON technical overview: No, unlike other blockchains where only transactions exist, in TON you have messages and transactions. Message is some data (optionally with some fund attached) which will cause transaction once delivered. Message are delivered non-instantaneously (transaction caused by message may be not only in other block but even in other chain then transaction which emitted that message). That means that at any moment total balance of the system is sum of balances of all accounts PLUS sum of all yet un-delivered messages. (reply to 1533)

Slava: Are you waiting for the page to load completely? (reply to 1618)

Dario: uhm, yes?

Slava: You are trying to access window.ton before making sure that it's initialized.

Dario: wait

Slava: You should access window.ton only after onTonReady() was called.

Dario: done, still doesent work (reply to 1632)

Slava: Please, update the example.

Dario: now i got only this error  TypeError: provider.send is not a function

Slava: Also, is tonweb_provider part necessary for this issue to occur?

Dario: well no (reply to 1640)

Slava: It works for me. I'm getting a Success alert.

Slava: Are you not?

Slava: I would also suggest to start a new clean instance of Chrome or Chromium with only TON extension installed to isolate possible problems that could come from other extensions. And make sure to install/reinstall the latest version.

Dario: Wait, i will check in 15 min

Dario: @slavafomin (reply to 1656)

Step: address i get from tonweb using mnemonic is not same as what i see in my tonkeeper app.

Dario: update: on a fresh chromium instance it work. i dont understand why, but it works. (reply to 1656)

Slava: Well, I would suggest to start uninstalling other extensions one-by-one to figure this out. (reply to 1660)

Slava: Or you could start by re-installing the TON extension first, to check if it would help.

Dario: i suggest to add a check in the wallet (reply to 1661)

Dario: that search for conflicts

Dario: probably i figured what was the problem.. the ever wallet i guess

Dario: well i removed it and seems to work, thanks

Dario: i will close the issue

Slava: Such conflicts are pretty hard to resolve and I don't think that it could be done automatically. Extensions have a lot of control of the browser.

Step: anybody can help me? (reply to 1659)

Slava: Don't close it yet. Add your findings to it instead. (reply to 1667)

Slava: We will need to study why exactly does it happen and if there's a way to prevent it. (reply to 1670)

Dario: Sure (reply to 1670)

Dario: I added a comment

Dario: Thanks for the help

Slava: Sure, don't hesitate to ask again.

Slava: Could you check this version: https://jsfiddle.net/qbmkdp3s/1/ (reply to 1674)

Slava: I think that the problem is that you are using var statements to define global variables like provider, which conflicts with the other extension that you've mentioned.

Dario: it works. but i already removed everscale wallet (reply to 1678)

Slava: Could you install it back again? For test purposes. (reply to 1680)

Slava: You should never use var in modern JavaScript development. Use let instead. It doesn't introduce global variables.

Dario: this fail (reply to 1678)

Dario: with ever wallet installed

Dario: yay thanks (reply to 1682)

Slava: https://jsfiddle.net/qbmkdp3s/3/

Slava: What about this?

Dario: fail

Slava: What's the error now?

Slava: Could you give a link to Everscale API? It's probably using the same names as TON.

Dario: sorry i dont know, i never worked with that api (reply to 1690)

Slava: I see. Well it's definitely a conflict then. Thanks for finding this out )

Dario: nothin

Dario: in any case, looks like this is the provider https://github.com/broxus/nekoton

Step: üòí

Dario: replace  tonweb.wallet.create with tonweb.wallet.all['v4R2'].create

Dario: i guess

Step: tonweb.wallet.all.v4R2.create is not a function (reply to 1699)

Slava: In any case, this should get you started: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic/blob/master/src/functions/generate-mnemonic.ts#L8

Evgeniy: May be i can switch to different server-side language (go, python) for my goal? (reply to 1730)

Slava: Yes, JavaScript would be a way to go üòÅ (reply to 1732)

Slava: Maybe someone else would be able to help you with python/go.

Ilya: Maybe you can help with instractions? We tried to reed this docs https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb, but can't find method for auth by words and password.  For example we researched this repository https://github.com/toncenter/ton-wallet, but their use custom version and many private functions

Slava: @iboge this should help you as well. Official web-wallet is actually a good example, because it uses TonWeb under the hood with all the required functionality. (reply to 1731)

Slava: It is essentially as simple as this:  import { generateMnemonic, mnemonicToKeyPair } from 'tonweb-mnemonic'; import nacl from 'tweetnacl';  const password = '12345'; const myWords = await generateMnemonic(24, password); const keyPair = await mnemonicToKeyPair(myMnemonicWords, password);

Ilya: Saw it by digging deeper. Thank you so much!

Aidan: Hey all - does anyone know why ther are different addresses between the PoW giver contracts listed here: https://ton.org/docs/#/howto/pow-givers and the ones listed here: https://tonwhales.com/mining (for example, giver 1: https://tonwhales.com/explorer/address/Ef-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprKDH).  I am confused as to which ones are the right givers...

Slava: It is address encoding issue. Essentially they are the same: -1:a491d63f07ba7eefb4cb9f685484ce9089d5abaec97c15858222f04ca592a9ac (reply to 1739)

Slava: You can convert address to a "canonical" non-user-friendly form like this: new TonWeb.Address('kf-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprBtN').toString(false);

Slava: This is especially useful when you need to compare two addresses.

Slava: But it will loose one bit of information (bounce flag). (reply to 1741)

Aidan: Ah thank you @slavafomin. Two follow ups: - Are they not unique IDs? I am looking up address from Whales Pool (`Ef-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprKDH`) on blockexplorer page you linked and don't see any matches with other non-user friendly forms from ton.org docs. Is this because these are 30  different account ids, each one of which points towards one of the 20 giver addresses? - Is there an SDK in python or is it just JS at this time?

Slava: I'm not sure I understood the first part of the question.  Regarding the second part, I'm not aware of the state of things in Python. Maybe someone else could be able to suggest a library. (reply to 1744)

Slava: Also, regarding the addresses. The same address could be encoded in various forms, and could contain additional information, besides the address hash itself. Like the bounce flag that I've mentioned.

Aidan: Ah ty @slavafomin I set up a JS script and ran all 10 addresses from tonwhale.com and the 20 from ton.org giver docs through to find what is UUID and see it involves workchain_id: i.e. `-1:243ba2ba421e9833875d8d161896f5402bb220c96f197adfb866f36b56c990e0 . Is this whole string referred to as Canonical address and UUID is `workchain_id + account hex? Still making my way through whitepaper üòÖ

Aidan: Also if I want to get all transactions for each Giver, assuming it doesn't matter if I use address from tonwhale or ton.org as they share same UUID?

Andrey: UUID is 128 bit, but ton addresses is 256 bit (reply to 1749)

Roman: Hello again. What is the best golang client? I want to connect to network without separate node running. I want to use this code for mobile app then. And is it possible to hide activity in tor or it requires udp?

Andrey: specifically, there is no native client for golang right now. only the original one from the ton-blockchain repository and I am actively working on implementing a light client for kotlin  https://github.com/andreypfau/ton-kotlin (reply to 1753)

Slava: Hey! Yes, UDP is required if you want to connect to the network directly. (reply to 1753)

Andrey: lite client<-> lite server use tcp (reply to 1755)

Dario: @slavafomin is there any way to detect if the wallet is connected to testnet or mainnet?

Slava: What do you mean by the "wallet" and by "connected"? (reply to 1762)

Dario: ton wallet extension  literally where the wallet send the boc, testnet or mainnet (reply to 1767)

Slava: The address format doesn't matter much when you use it to query data from the API. (reply to 1749)

Slava: It's not possible at the moment, but we are working on it. Stay tuned for updates. (reply to 1762)

I: Can I call "() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure" method using TonWeb, and how?

Dario: okay, in web3js its web3.eth.net.getNetworkType([callback]) (reply to 1771)

Dario: hope it will be similar

Aidan: Thank you (reply to 1769)

Denny: I sent a transfer from wallet.ton.org, but FTX didn't accepted. Can I retrieve the transaction?

Step: if i send ton to a new address it returns to sender address.  i dont know why can anybody explain? see here https://tonscan.org/address/EQBe5c--GxBmEELA1Eq8YJj2qUGMM_UMZxKGbHdAxLMJ8e3i

Slava: This is by design. You will have to remove the bounceable flag from the destination address in order for transaction to complete. (reply to 1785)

Step: how to remove? (reply to 1786)

Slava: You can find an example in TON wallet for Web source code.

Step: i have like this wallet.methods.transfer({                                 secretKey: keyPair.secretKey,                                 toAddress: 'EQCaZIDBfiLx39a5I1ynYoVXINpgWY96-BuOSgwjIo85RqKs',                                 amount: TonWeb.utils.toNano(0.1), // 0.01 TON                                 seqno: seqno || 0,                                 payload: '123456',                                 sendMode: 3,                             }).send().then(tx=>{                                     console.log(tx);                             }).catch(e=>{                                     console.log(e);                             }) (reply to 1788)

Slava: You should only clear the bounce flag for the uninitialized accounts. In other cases keep it set. (reply to 1791)

Kis: Hi I sent Toncoin without comment and now the coin was lost, can you help me?

Kis: I need the txid number, where can I find?

Aidan: When looking at mining of Giver Contracts why is the out_msgs_source value different from the giver address address listed on the website? Seems there are three key address, implying there are 3 parties involved for each mining tx: the giver contract address, the out_msgs_source, and the out_msgs_destination. Shouldn‚Äôt there just be two: destination =  the miner and source = giver contract address?

Aidan: Could this be because the giver contract address and the out_msgs_source point to the same address hash and the only way to figure this out is to run a unpackAddress() API request for each giver contract address and out_msgs_source?

‚Äî 2022-04-09 ‚Äî

Juan: where do I see what has been mined so far?

Vova: what is the maximum and minimum number of characters in a Tonkeepr address?

Vova: I'm making a bot, I need to check for the entered wallet address

Dario: If you use nodejs, just use TonWeb.Address to verify addresses, in other cases a regex can be useful (reply to 1816)

Dario: ^(0|-1):([a-f0-9]{64}|[A-F0-9]{64})$

Dario: This one can be used to verify pubkeys

Step: {   '@type': 'query.fees',   source_fees: {     '@type': 'fees',     in_fwd_fee: 9254000,     storage_fee: 580,     gas_fee: 3308000,     fwd_fee: 1000000   },   destination_fees: [],   '@extra': '1649509088.4310362:0:0.8238671278009352' } can anybody explain this?  i am trying to calculate fee for a txn how to calculate total fee?

Step: do i also have to sum destination_fees.in_fwd_fee storage_fee gas_fee fwd_fee? (reply to 1826)

Slava: You will need to add all the fees together. (reply to 1826)

Step: both source_fees and destination_fees? (reply to 1828)

Slava: This is the way to go. Just wrap it in the try... catch block. (reply to 1819)

Slava: No, all four source fees. (reply to 1829)

Step: ok (reply to 1831)

Step: one more question

Step: https://tonscan.org/address/EQCaZIDBfiLx39a5I1ynYoVXINpgWY96-BuOSgwjIo85RqKs what cause this address to go inactive?

Slava: This will not work for all address types, so I would advise against using it. (reply to 1820)

Slava: And this will work not only for Node.js, but for any JavaScript application. (reply to 1819)

Dario: Yeah its only for raw pubkeys (reply to 1835)

Aidan: Hey all -  I am trying to figure out which address from when I call getTransactions() on a Giver contract represents the address that has mined the TONCoins and is receiving them. I see an in_msg_destination value and and out_msgs_destination value in the response. I am assuming that out_msgs_destination is address that has mined the TONCoins and is receiving them. Is that correct?

Slava: I would like to remind everyone that this is an English speaking chat.

Aidan: @slavafomin would you have any insight on my message above?

Slava: It's transaction.out_msgs['0'].destination. (reply to 1863)

Aidan: Thank u sir !

Cyber.Pz: Good saturday everyone!

George: A question about pure/impure functions. In TON, are functions that read data that are not passed to it through parameters considered pure or impure (considering no data is modified) ?

Andrey: If function return nothing and it's pure - func will optimize it and willn't run (reply to 1874)

George: What determines purity in func ?  a) must only read function params b) can read values outside of function params and return value dependent on params c) can read values outside of function params but return value must be independent of global data  In all three cases the function of course does not modify data outside of its scope

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Practically: a) "impure" modifier present - guarantees correct behaviour b) "impure" modifier absent - FunC compiler will do strange things, such as strip out some code without your permission.

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: It will silently remove the function call in two cases: a) function returns nothing: () fun() { } b) function returns something, but this something is not assigned to anything: (int) fun() { return 5; } ... int a = fun(); ;; fun is called fun(); ;; fun call is removed

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: This is a very bad behavior of FunC compiler which should be altered, but that is how it is for now

Andrey: Open issue for intellij-ton. We can make inspections for these cases: https://github.com/andreypfau/intellij-ton/issues (reply to 1880)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: In this case I actually think it's an issue of FunC/FunC-compiler, not IntelliJ TON (reply to 1881)

Andrey: unfortunately, func is extremely slow to update, it would be better to do inspections now, and when it is fixed in the func-clampiler, it can be turned off. at the moment, this is a temporary and best solution for this problem (reply to 1882)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Opened (reply to 1881)

Andrey: Next week I will start work on it (reply to 1884)

TON technical overview: Well, this is correct behaviour: if result of some code is not used it can be ommited (unless it has side effects). The only problem with that is that 'impureness' is not inherited. (reply to 1880)

Witer33: Couldn't you automatically add impure to functions without return values? (reply to 1887)

Andrey: It should be made on IDE level, not on compiler (reply to 1888)

Andrey: As inspection with quick-fix suggestion

Witer33: Maybe a warning could be useful in the compiler (reply to 1889)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: > ... The only problem with that is that 'impureness' is not inherited ... And that is a big problem Automatic impureness actually doesn't even work "one level". Function () fun() { set_data(begin_cell().end_cell()); }  is going to be omitted, although it directly uses impure 'set_data' (reply to 1887)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: "impure" keyword should not exist in the first place. There is zero problem to automatically compute impureness of everything on the compiler level (reply to 1889)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: It's Pythonists approach: fix language inherent problems with IDE suggestions:)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Although even Python is getting better

Andrey: Yep, like warnings (reply to 1889)

Andrey: Or impure functions by default with pure command

Andrey: (So you can optimize on own way)

George: Thank you (reply to 1878)

S: Guys, tell me please, what is this Election contract.  And why does he have a balance greater than the stake of all validators?

Slava: I guess this is because validator's stake is divided into two halves and only one half is effectively used during pending validation round. (reply to 1903)

S: So it is like one part uses as collateral? (reply to 1904)

Slava: No. The validation rounds and the elections are overlapping, so in order to participate in the next round you will need to make a stake before it begins (to participate in the elections), while your previous stake is not yet released. (reply to 1905)

S: Aha, got it

S: Thanks

S: Also interested about inflation. As I know it is 0.6%. It is calculated from all circulation supply (more than 5 billions)? Or only from initialized account balances (1.2 billions) or from the validator‚Äô stakes (100-200 mln)?

‚Äî 2022-04-10 ‚Äî

Andrey: From all coins in network (5 billion) (reply to 1910)

S: Unfortunately it is not possible.  According to the inflation of 0.6%, new coins with 0.6% of inflation = 30 000 000 new coins. If validators has 200 mln TON coins, only with inflation they will have ROI in 15%, without any gas rewards. But rewards for validators now is only 13%. So I can‚Äôt understand the math in this network (reply to 1920)

Andrey: How you calculate 13%? (reply to 1923)

S: All the guys who has validators said me that %, also on the page of TON whales nominators they say that rewards of the network is ~ 13% (reply to 1924)

Andrey: Ton whales takes fee (reply to 1925)

S: It is without fee, with their fee, it will be 10% only (reply to 1926)

No√´l: Will the native token functionality open in future? And what's the difference between fungible token?

J: Yup. Tonwhale takes about 24.8% of staking profit fee, Tonstake.com takes 10%, looking forward for the official nominator can give the people a better choice. (reply to 1927)

S: Guys, what is the System address? and why it is not active for a long period of time? https://tonwhales.com/explorer/address/Ef8AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAU

Gnosis: Who told you that the Ton Foundation will make its own staking service? (reply to 1929)

J: It was on the road map, perhaps I was wrong. (reply to 1938)

J: By how you questioning this, I assume the foundation doesn‚Äôt need to make it‚Äôs own staking service, and they don‚Äôt need to. That‚Äôs very logical, thanks for correcting,

Gnosis: üëç (reply to 1942)

Slava: What is TON? Oh baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me No more

Slava: In English, please.

K: Hey guys...  i ran the validator on the local computer..  processes hang and nothing happens in the status

K: i have 2 warnings - and I don‚Äôt understand what to do .. they write that udp ports must be open - are they open or I don‚Äôt understand something

F: Ru -> @tondev (reply to 1963)

K: In general, do I understand this validator on vps correctly?  there is an article on habr√© where they said that the validator should work for more than 18 hours before getting something for validation

K: ok ... i can to translate (reply to 1968)

K: correct ? (reply to 1968)

F: Yes. Ignore the warnings - you don't need them. They only warn that you are not a validator. Maybe this guide will help you: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/docs/raw/master/docs/nodes/setup_validator.mp4 (reply to 1972)

K: hmm .. How can I become a validator?

F: You must have a synchronized node and enough coins to stake. Read more here: https://ton.org/validator (reply to 1974)

K: hmm ... ok i can be only node ((

Aidan: Can anyone share a resource that covers or explain the difference between in_msg and out_msgs values when I run getTransactions API request?

Svetly: Anyone know how to bypass the 10 transaction limit in the   https://ton.sh/api getTransaction query?

Aidan: @smetodiev don't think you can on ton.sh but if you use https://toncenter.com/api/v2/ can go higher

Aidan: Same calls/endpoints

Svetly: awesome, thanks!

User<5168004870>: Is there are any website I can find the proportion of stake of top wallets?

Step: Is it possible to run usdt trc20, erc20 like contract on ton blockchain?

Emilia: Why doesn't TON have an explorer similar to the other big projects where there is detailed information about the number of accounts, the current and maximum number of transactions, the circulating and total supply, the number of validators/nominators and their stakes, inflation, TVL, etc.? On network status tonmon.xyz, a lot of data are missing and those present do not seem to be up to date.

J: https://tonscan.org/ Do you mean this? (reply to 1992)

J: or one of these?

Emilia: None of them provides such information. The best one is tonmon.xyz although the data provided are not complete. (reply to 1993)

J: I got it, you have a very good suggestion. (reply to 1995)

J: Would you like to build it? or asking someone who has a validator to work with?

Emilia: Unfortunately, I have neither the time nor the knowledge to do this. (reply to 1997)

User<5047986005>: https://toncoin.tonscan.io/ I think this one is closest to what you're looking for. (reply to 1995)

Emilia: This is the TON crystal blockhain explorer, a fork of the original TON now rebranded as everscale https://everscan.io/. (reply to 1999)

Andrey: Nope. https://toncoin.tonscan.io/ is for our toncoin (reply to 2001)

Andrey: Tonscan.io (without toncoin) is everscale

User<5047986005>: Yes, they are running service for both TON and the everscale. The link I gave you are the correct one.

Emilia: However, the data (number of total account, transactions, circulating supply) reported are not correct. (reply to 2002)

Andrey: It's correct (reply to 2005)

User<5047986005>: What made you say so? The information should be correct because it's fed directly from TON. (reply to 2005)

Emilia: If they are correct, there is a discrepancy with the data reported by ton.org and coinmarketcap. (reply to 2007)

Andrey: What is not correct? (reply to 2008)

Emilia: Total number of account: ton.org 401k while the explorer 276k. Circulating supply ton.org and coinmarketcap 1.22 G while the explorer 5 G (total supply). Transactions: ton.org 48.9 M while the explorer 204 M. (reply to 2009)

Vasilii: This is not correct data.  I'm talking about coinmarketcap (reply to 2010)

Emilia: Are you talking about the circulating supply? (reply to 2012)

Vasilii: This is data from coinmarketcap (reply to 2014)

Vasilii: It just shows wallets wrapped in ethereum

Vasilii: As far as I understand, now there are 5kkk coins, but 1.2kkk of them are not lost and alive (reply to 2013)

User<5047986005>: There was an article about this. Coinmarketcap only counts TON in active wallet. Sorry tried to find that article for you but couldn't see it anywhere again. (reply to 2013)

Emilia: The only data I took from coinmarketcap is the circulating supply. The other data are from ton.org. Also why is explorer not in the list of official explorers here https://ton.app/explorers? (reply to 2014)

User<5047986005>: It should be there (reply to 2019)

Emilia: Right. It should be important to have a consistent data across the various sources. (reply to 2020)

Vasilii: everyone can create an explorer and not all explorers that show the correct data will be on this tab (reply to 2019)

Vasilii: There are 5kkk Toncoins in total.  1.2kkk active or are on wallets that have been created after holders knew that the test network would be real (reply to 2021)

Emilia: https://coinmarketcap.com/faq/ (reply to 2023)

Vasilii: where to look? (reply to 2024)

Emilia: Circulating supply vs total supply vs max supply (reply to 2025)

Mohommad: Hello, About the API documentation, How can i create a new address? I didn't see any example for creation and send transaction. Could you give me a guidance?

Slava: I would suggest to use JavaScript library for this: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb  TON JS Examples (reply to 2056)

Mohommad: I want to use python and django and there is no python SDK, so if you can guide me through the toncenter api, maybe I can develop the python sdk too. (reply to 2057)

Slava: That would require a deep knowledge in TON. You should start with the documentation and the whitepappers then. (reply to 2058)

Mohommad: There is no available api just for creation then? Except js sdk. (reply to 2059)

Slava: One of the options is to write a wrapper around C++ TonLib library. That's how TonCenter is working by the way. You can use its source code for inspiration.

Andrey: Maybe it's easy to implement with toncli (reply to 2060)

Andrey: It use Python and have many features to interact with TON.   You can use it just as module in your python project

Andrey: Also soon we want to use only tonlib dependency instead of lite-client / fift / func

Ruslan: You could try this one: https://github.com/kdimentionaltree/tApi It‚Äôs a python part of TonCenter for single liteserver. Example is in sandbox.ipynb (reply to 2058)

Slava: @tvorogme maybe you could write a small newbie guide for python developers? So we could share it with all the new people who's askin'.

Andrey: Quick start guide with all installation process in Linux / Windows / Mac (m1, intel) is not what's needed?  Any other ideas? (reply to 2066)

Andrey: Advanced docs are very rich in toncli

Ruslan: One day I‚Äôll document this oneüòÑ (reply to 2066)

Slava: Some day, some day... üòÅ (reply to 2070)

Andrey: Maybe it's cool to add some jupyter notebooks with example usage not as CLI, but like lib (reply to 2068)

Slava: I was under impression that toncli is a CLI (what made me think so?) üòÅ  However, people are looking for python SDK, a library to write their own Python code. If toncli can be used as a library, I would suggest to extract this SDK part into a separate repository or to provide an additional manual from the library perspective. (reply to 2068)

Mohommad: Is there any documentation for using the cli and runing it? (reply to 2064)

N: Ton developing environment is very difficult to set up (Took me 6 hours to set it up, and I failed setting it up on my M1 mac and had to use a ubuntu virtual machine online). Maybe the team should consider making some directly available online ton running environment or something like that...

Andrey: I think this is great idea, will think about it) (reply to 2073)

Andrey: https://github.com/disintar/toncli/blob/master/docs/apple_m1_compile_fix.md (reply to 2075)

Andrey: Have you checked out our guide for compiling ton on m1?

N: Of course

Andrey: Hm, all people who try to follow it have success (reply to 2080)

Slava: Having a full-fledged Python SDK would be a great thing for the TON ecosystem. We could publish it in the official documentation. Maybe @ruslixag would be able to help with this initiative? I'm not a Python developer myself, so I can only help conceptually :) (reply to 2076)

Dario: Hi guys, I would like to let you know that I have created a web dapp that works as a minter for fungible and non-fungible tokens. It also works on testnet, and requires the ton wallet extension for chrome. it is a paid service (even if everything is serverless) and as soon as I release the dex for fungible tokens I will publish the code in clear text and make it free. in any case, if you want to try it, here is the link mainnet: https://minter.tonox.exchange/ testnet: https://minter.tonox.exchange/?testnet

Dario: (thanks also to slava for help with the wallet)

Dario: also let me know if everything goes wrong

User<1029195636>: Is there a way to increase or set the gas fee?

User<1029195636>: I don't believe it is available with the TON wallet and I am not certain how to do it programatically

Andrey: Gas fee is just config param (reply to 2101)

Andrey: Validators could vote for changing config

User<1029195636>: What is the property for this? How can I set it? (reply to 2103)

User<1029195636>: I notice some transactions arrive 10 minutes later than others, although they where sent first

User<1029195636>: I'd like to speed them up

Andrey: You actually can't set this param. It's auto calculated from your transaction. (reply to 2105)

User<1029195636>: ü•≤ So I can't speed up a transaction

Ruslan: Yep, you need to create folder ‚Äòprivate‚Äô in the root of repo (reply to 2100)

Andrey: Why do you need it? All transactions are fast :)) (reply to 2109)

User<1029195636>: Not for exchanges I need more than 200-500 confirmations sometimes (reply to 2111)

User<1029195636>: It's not fast enough

User<1029195636>: for p2p it is

Ruslan: Also thanks for report! It could be a bug. I‚Äôll check it (reply to 2100)

Mohommad: I am so happy that i could find the main TON Dev Chat, I was disappointed :(. Thanks for your quick responses. (reply to 2115)

Alexander: Hello! I am continue TON blockchain parsing journey and have another question)  I am querying transactions for address (UQDqDHsF9FNi-_GqodxGvgcnOwFcfZXP007OQBbNjIllPVFJ): https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getTransactions?address=UQDqDHsF9FNi-_GqodxGvgcnOwFcfZXP007OQBbNjIllPVFJ&limit=10&to_lt=0&archival=true  Got first returned transaction unixtime (1639393650) and searching for a block seqno in the basechain: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/lookupBlock?workchain=0&shard=-9223372036854775808&unixtime=1639393650  Than I found my initial transaction with the same lt and hash as fifth in the block: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getBlockTransactions?workchain=0&shard=-9223372036854775808&seqno=21694181  But initial transaction address (base64 - UQDqDHsF9FNi-_GqodxGvgcnOwFcfZXP007OQBbNjIllPVFJ) is not the same as the returned one (hex - 0:ea0c7b05f45362fbf1aaa1dc46be07273b015c7d95cfd34ece4016cd8c89653d). Base64url to hex converting of the first transaction gives me 5100ea0c7b05f45362fbf1aaa1dc46be07273b015c7d95cfd34ece4016cd8c89653d5149, which is similar to returned one, but there are additional 2 bytes of data in the beginning and in the end of the address. Moreover, combination of hex to Base64 encoding of the returned address with /getTransactions method returns me "error": "Incorrect address" and absolutely other address (6gx7BfRTYvvxqqHcRr4HJzsBXH2Vz9NOzkAWzYyJZT0=). I thought that Base64 wallet address string equality check is enough, but it seems that I am wrong. Can you explain me such behaviour, please?

RocketMan: this is exchange problem, not ton problem (reply to 2112)

RocketMan: exchange programmers just copy-paste TON intergration from some proof of work blockchain integration and enter random number of confirmations :)

User<1029195636>: So there is no way to speed up the rate of confirmations? You are saying that the exchanges are simply asking for too high of a number?

User<1029195636>: What is weird is that one transaction will actually finish faster than another transaction that is 10 minutes older

RocketMan: correct (reply to 2121)

RocketMan: exchanges sucks (reply to 2122)

Andrey: in ton blockhain if you have transaction in blockchain its already "confirmed" (reply to 2121)

Slava: The addresses that you've provided are the same. (reply to 2118)

RocketMan: not ton sucks :D

Andrey: We needed FAQ with top10 questions :)) (reply to 2126)

User<1029195636>: Are you saying that confirmation numbers do not matter? (reply to 2125)

Slava: I'm already working on it :) (reply to 2128)

Andrey: yep (reply to 2129)

Andrey: All devs must know that 1 raw address has 4 base64 forms

RocketMan: basically every exchange should count tx after 1 "confirmation". not all do this.

User<1029195636>: I thought it was a way to avoid "double-spending"

Andrey: Also 1 raw address is valid with / without leading zeroes (reply to 2132)

User<1029195636>: Exchanges actually hold up TON saying that it is to avoid double-spending: For like 500 confirmations

User<1029195636>: Are you saying that's all nonsense?

RocketMan: yep (reply to 2137)

Slava: Actually eight :) (reply to 2132)

User<1029195636>: Ah geeze, ok I suppose it really is an exchange issue

RocketMan: but I understand them partially   some one more new blockchain, throwing to some junior middle dev, saying copy-paste integration X. :)  nobody wants to dig into details :)  wait for X confirmations is safe way :)

Andrey: OK, bounce / not bounce , b64 / b64url (reply to 2139)

Andrey: Other? (reply to 2139)

Slava: These are all possible variants of the same address ^

User<1029195636>: lol yeah I guess I expected more from an exchange though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (reply to 2141)

Yakitori: I'm a solidity dev, I took a look at FunC

‚Äî 2022-04-12 ‚Äî

I: Is there already an on-chain current TON price contract?

I: For example, with some off-chain thing pulling the price data from CEXes

Yakitori: We'd need an oracle for this

Yakitori: Or a liquidity pair

I: yeah, that's what I was thinking

I: and with no DEXes implemented rn, it does not seem possible without some centralized third party

I: but this thing still blocks quite a bit of defi ideas

Yakitori: Well we need to build the basic blocks

Yakitori: I'll look into how we could implement a clone of Uniswap v2

Yakitori: Could be very nice

I: yeah I'm thinking to implement the first native algorithmic stablecoin

Yakitori: Then I guess it's easier to use an oracle (reply to 2197)

I: yeah, anyway I'll make third party pyth-like centralized price api to use for now

Yakitori: Chainlink's model is quite interesting

Yakitori: But

Yakitori: You'll need to burn some gas to keep it awake

Yakitori: Do you want to team up? (reply to 2199)

User<5298987488>: Hi everyone. I‚Äôm having trouble with my address.  Used tonlib-cli to generate key and made a deposit to the address it gave me.  The deposit is showing on the explorer but when I import the seed to a mobile wallet it shows a different address and zero balance.

User<5168004870>: Hi guys, I wanna know more about self-healing, what's its source code path?

Slava: Hey! That's because different wallet software uses different versions of the wallet smart contract. You will need to find out what wallet smart contract version was used to generate your original address. (reply to 2206)

Slava: Or you can just transfer the coins from the old address to the new one. It's quite cheap.

User<5298987488>: Thank you.  The latest version of tonlib-cli using the ‚Äòimportkey‚Äô function and my 24 words produces the correct address (same as when I generated it about two months ago).  How can I determine this wallet smart contract?

Slava: It appears that it's a dynamic configuration. However, it looks like version 2.0 is the default one (I guess it's also named v2R1).

Slava: Can't you just transfer the coins out of it then? (reply to 2210)

User<5298987488>: Thank you for your help.  I used the cli ‚Äògenkey‚Äô command two months ago and saved the 24 words, public key, and address it produced.  I never connected it to a server at the time.  I assumed when I needed the TON I could recreate a wallet using the same 24 words, public key and address combination.  Is this not the case?

User<5298987488>: To be honest I don‚Äôt know how to use this tonlib-cli command and cannot find documentation (ie how to connect to a node / error 500 no lite servers)

User<5298987488>: Or else I would do as u suggest

Slava: Let's see if someone will be able to suggest a course of action for tonlib-cli later today. If not, please ping me again.

Ami: Hi Guys,  I‚Äôm trying to run ton validator on testnet. I‚Äôm using mytonctrl and upgraded to safer_overlay_plus (upgrade safer_overlay_plus from mytonctrl). It seems that ton was build successfully after upgrade but global config still points to mainnet and not testnet config. I‚Äôve wget testnet config, manually replaced it and executed systemctl restart validator to restart validator but it doesn‚Äôt seems to work (process falis to start). Does anyone know if mytonctrl supports validator on testnet?

F: For the node to work on the test network, it must be reinstalled using the test configuration file: sudo bash /usr/src/mytonctrl/scripts/uninstall.sh sudo bash install.sh -m full -c https://newton-blockchain.github.io/testnet-global.config.json (reply to 2235)

Ami: Got you, cool I'll try it. Thanks

Ami: @f_closer works thanks! do you know how can I get suffcient ton tokens on testnet to run as validator? https://wallet.ton.org/?testnet=true send only 2 tons

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): Hello guys, here is a math library for func, maybe it could be useful for you, i will add more functions when i need them  https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/math.func

User<2009577231>: Hi there, I'm a little confused so what do you think?  The point is at whitepaper, it says toncoin inflation is about 2% yearly and it make sense. But at this post in channel  https://t.me/toncoin/143 It clearly says inflation is 0.6%.  It's a thing and another thing that's bothering me is at CMC page wrote down Toncoin max supply is 5BL while this two source have another story and the bottom line is that there are no restrictions for max supply and CMC is basically wrong.   Please let me know if I'm missing something.

User<2009577231>: ton.org/toncoin That whitepaper is written for gram. So are we facing an update?

F: information from https://ton.org/primer.pdf is prioritized. Accordingly, inflation is 0.6%  There is no such thing as the max supply, since time is infinite. One can only say what the total supply will be at a particular point in time.  And yet, questions on economics are hardly development questions, so it‚Äôs better to ask such questions in a general chat (reply to 2325)

F: If you want to try to raise the validator in the test network - write me in private messages. You must have a synchronized node on the testnet. Next, we will give you instructions on how to get test coins for validation in testnet. (reply to 2240)

User<2009577231>: My bad, problem was with white paper that's why I found here best, anyway there are POS based tokens with a fixed supply limit while time is infinite for them too right? So it was a possibility.  Um will primer get updates over the time? (reply to 2328)

User<5168004870>: Hi, I'd like to know how can I make sure that the shard block my transaction is on has been recorded on masterchain via tonweb?

J: Basically, Ton is a POS base ecosystem, the reason that it can be POW mining, it's because they made a smart contract to make it POW to release TON to the public. (reply to 2310)

Emilia: I found the results of a past TON contest https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/43. There are some interesting projects, why are they not used as the official explorer/network status? (reply to 1992)

Slava: Well, there are a lot of options actually. But I would suggest that "integrating with TON" shouldn't be a goal in itself. You should ask yourself what qualities/functionality are you lacking from your current distribution model and then when you know the answer you can look if TON is the right tool for you.

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: I see what you mean in general, although in this specific case I have to note that ideas are not a subject to copyright, you have to manually patent them

Slava: Well, I myself don't believe in copyrights, patents and that some individual human can take ownership of some idea. So I wouldn't see any benefits in such use of the blockchain technology. However, some people would. And this idea is very well understood and implemented. So what is your point exactly? :)

Slava: Why do you need blockchain for this? What problem are you trying to solve? (reply to 2391)

Slava: So that funds earned by the final product could be shared among all the creators?

Slava: Yes, that is one of the greatest advantages of TON as a solution. (reply to 2396)

Slava: What's stopping you from not referencing the original authors? (reply to 2397)

Slava: A good will? (reply to 2401)

Slava: Could you describe the toolkit in more details then?

Slava: Well that's a fine idea and I think it could be implemented in TG/TON without any serious problems. Maybe dedicated contract developers could give more insight on this though. (reply to 2407)

isoscele üíé: Hi there. How to easily communicate to a smart contract i deployed? Crafting message or using a normal transaction

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): Tonweb is kinda easy (reply to 2412)

Slava: I was talking about a more general idea of using blockchain for authorship. (reply to 2409)

isoscele üíé: I have to use it to test the functionalities of my smart contract. is that the way to go? (reply to 2413)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): In the future i will release a lib to do everything in the web, just like minter.tonox.exchange

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): Yeah sure (reply to 2415)

Slava: You can look at how various built-in contracts are implemented in TonWeb. (reply to 2412)

isoscele üíé: Thank you. and finally i found a ton dev community not russian

isoscele üíé: It's nice to be here ‚ù§Ô∏è

Slava: I wouldn't call it not Russian though üòÅ Most of the knowledgeable and active people here are Russians.

isoscele üíé: No problem! I was just referring to the fact that the official ton dev (ENG) was full of russian messages (reply to 2423)

Slava: I would suggest to write your ideas in a more formal way. You can then post it here and look for devs who would like to help you with this. We now also have a fund that could be contacted for financial support. (reply to 2425)

Slava: That's just bad moderation I guess :) (reply to 2426)

Slava: Sorry, I don't have any good examples on my mind. However, the key would be to make it as clear and concise as possible. Visuals will also help, e.g. you could create some schemes and collaborate with the designer on UI of your marketplace/bot. (reply to 2429)

isoscele üíé: I'm testing tonweb on node with the example but the example contains async functions and it says "SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function". Am i doing smth wrong?

Slava: You will need to know the JavaScript on a decent level if you are going to use the TonWeb. (reply to 2432)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Make functions async: `async function ...`

Slava: What examples are you talking about?

Slava: That's a dangerous advice :) (reply to 2434)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Note, though, that (at a basic level) you'll need to "await" all of the calls to your function (reply to 2434)

isoscele üíé: I fixed it by myself but i meant the example alone is not working. I needed to add personally the handling of the async stuff (reply to 2433)

isoscele üíé: Anyway thx for direction! :)

Slava: What example are you talking about? Can you point me to the problem directly? (reply to 2438)

isoscele üíé: copying and paste this in a raw .js gives me the async warning

Slava: Yeah, I see. That's because global awaits are not supported in CommonJS. You will need to wrap it in async function.

Slava: // This will do the trick (async () => {   await doSomethnig(); })();

isoscele üíé: That worked too! Thx!

Slava: These examples are not meant to be just copied and pasted directly. It's just a rough idea of how to use the TonWeb. We will be rewriting all the documentation in the near future. (reply to 2441)

isoscele üíé: I have a generated keypair. How to import the secretKey in code? I tried passing it as a string (hex version) but didnt work

Slava: Secret key should be passed as Uint8Array.

Slava: nacl will give you the keys in the correct format already.

Slava: You can also do the following:  const secretKey = TonWeb.utils.hexToBytes('YOUR HEX'); const keyPair = TonWeb.utils.nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSecretKey(secretKey);

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: That's not true Node.js supports global await, but you might need to update it and enable new features (reply to 2442)

Slava: Yes, it is only supported in ESM modules. So your file must have an .mjs extension and it must be compiled to ESM. It is rarely used in practice, so I've generalized. (reply to 2453)

‚Äî 2022-04-14 ‚Äî

isoscele üíé: How to switch to testnet tonweb? Am i forced to get an api key for https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC?

Slava: You will need to set proper TonCenter URL when you initialize the TonWeb provider. (reply to 2458)

isoscele üíé: Ok Done. Default is mainnet. I was getting too confused haha

isoscele üíé: Looks like const secretKey = TonWeb.utils.hexToBytes('F2049F029029E092F90EF90290EF2F2E0F209'); gives me a Error: bad secret key size (reply to 2451)

Slava: Private key must have 64 bytes or 128 chars in HEX format. (reply to 2467)

Slava: Your HEX-string is incorrect in general, because it has odd number of chars.

isoscele üíé: I replaced it with random chars to hide it xd (reply to 2469)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Don't worry People here are all super honest You can post your private keys here no problem

isoscele üíé: It's still a testnet thing so ye, who cares

isoscele üíé:     const secretKey = TonWeb.utils.hexToBytes('229715B35FE31CD0EC2DFCCEFDB381C2F9E6B284BE36D7D12B3933AD26E7B540');     const keyPair = TonWeb.utils.nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSecretKey(secretKey);

User<5298987488>: Hi everyone, A couple months ago I created a private key using ‚Äòtonlib-cli genkey‚Äô and made a paper backup of the mnemonic words, public key and address.  Now the block explorer shows a positive balance at the address but trying to recreate this wallet on a lite client via mnemonic references another address with zero balance.  If I enter my mnemonic in tonlib-cli importkey it still produces the original address so I don‚Äôt think I made a mistake in writing the 24 words or address.  I also don‚Äôt know how to connect tonlib-cli to a node to try accessing the address via cli instead of lite client.  I get error 500: no lite server and I can‚Äôt find any documentation on telling tonlib-cli to connect to nodes.  Would appreciate any tips on how to proceed.  Many thanks!

Slava: You should start with the documentation section on the website. (reply to 2511)

isoscele üíé: Hello! I have a question: I craft a transaction via tonweb, I attach there SENDER seqno using wallet.methods.seqno().call(); . Then i send the transaction to a standard wallet. It works well. In the code of a standard wallet (recipient), it checks the seqno sent from the sender with the local seqno(msg_seqno == stored_seqno). My question is: How could be storedseqno and msg_seqno the same if, the sender attached his own seqno and the recipient checks the SENDER seqno with his own stored_seqno? Shouldn't the transaction include RECIPIENT seqno in order to this to work well? I'm asking this because the seqno of my contract increases when I send a transaction, not when i receive one. And then the wallet receives, it doesnt increase the seqno. (Im watching the seqno on the explorer test-dot-tonwhales) Where can I read how this works? Is there a documentation or explaination of this kind of stuff?

Dario: Im just calling cell.oneFromBoc

Slava: Can you please provide a BOC string? Also, are you absolutely sure that it's correct?

Dario: well... im pretty sure its correct (reply to 2612)

Slava: TonWeb has a few bugs in the BOC realm, we are planning to fix them in the next update.

Dario: :(

Slava: Can you please provide a BOC string?

Dario: sure

Dario: check pm (reply to 2616)

Dario: but help me here, maybe it can be useful to others

Dario: looks like the problem were in my code. jettonWalletCodeHex should be a string, not a parsed boc (in new TonWeb.token.ft.JettonMinter() (reply to 2619)

Slava: We've pinpointed the problem and resolved it. TonWeb was working correctly. The short story is ‚Äî always use TypeScript for JS development and you will avoid a lot of hard-to-catch issues. (reply to 2619)

Dario: no nvm

Dario: my fault

Slava: You mean inconsistencies in the API?

Dario: nah not really, im not making a jettonwallet instance (reply to 2628)

Dario: its okay as it is

Slava: We are going to improve it dramatically in the version 2.0. But it will take time. (reply to 2628)

Dario: btw i found another issue: the contract is deployed correctly but data is empty (reply to 2632)

Dario: i dont know if its mine fault or tonweb

Slava: The official Jetton contracts are working with TonWeb correctly. Considering your previous trivial mistake I would assume, that you are doing something wrong. Try to debug your code more deeply and study how official Jetton contracts are working in TonWeb to find the difference.

Dario: found the problem: do not use global vars

isoscele üíé: Is subwallet_id the same as workchain_id?

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: No subwallet_id is the property of the contract to be able to create several wallets with the same key pair (reply to 2696)

Dario: I never understood this choice. Why you cant just hash the priv key (reply to 2697)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: I don't understand what you don't understand:) The main (and only(?) goal) of subwallet ids is to make it possible to create multiple wallets with a single key pair. How would you achieve it differently? (reply to 2700)

Dario: First wallet => random bytes Second wallet => first 32 byte of hash(first wallet private key) And so on (reply to 2701)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: random bytes ... where

Dario: I mean, the seed

Andrey: It's not quite true (reply to 2697)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: address in TON == hash(code + initial state) If initial state doesn't include any extra info (like subwallet id), than for the same "code + public key" combination you'll get the same address (and no multiple wallets) (reply to 2704)

Andrey: You may use one keypair thrue several wallet versions, each version of wallet will have 0 subwallet

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Yes, different code => different address But that is insecure, because signed transaction for one of such wallets will also be a correct signed transaction for another one of such wallets (provided we can make their "seqno"s match) (reply to 2707)

Dario: Yeah, but thats not what i mean  I will make an example (reply to 2706)

Andrey: Lol, great idea, need to scan for such cases all blockchain, guess will find some buggy wallets (reply to 2709)

Andrey: But it's quite hard, it's needed message to be valid too, but I think there is no much chance

Dario: im finally at home so.. @nns2009 in a contract you save a Ed25519 public key derivated from a private key (just some random bytes). so you can hash it x times (the private key) to get an actual sub wallet (you will get another private key) (reply to 2710)

Dario: without storing different int (wallet_id) but just pushing contracts with different pubkey

Dario: thats what i mean

Dario: so, deterministic subwallet by hashing the "first" private key => each contract will have a different data (public key will change)

Dario: i dont like the idea that a wallet has a shared pub key for the reason that @tvorogme said  honestly the whole idea of subwallet_id sucks

Andrey: :)

Witer33: https://github.com/witer33/toncenter  I'm working on this Toncenter API wrap for Python, what do you think?

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Does any random 256 bits constitute a valid Ed25519 private key? (reply to 2717)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Can you link me that reason? I was reading all of the chat lately, but don't remember it (reply to 2722)

Dario: yes (actually, its used as a seed)  so you can use sha256 to generate another private key (for example) (reply to 2728)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: What's the problem with subwallet ids?

Dario: useless -> you share your public key among differents wallets -> someone can use this method to change a wallet but this can lead to double spending (in very specific cases)

Dario: but mostly, you are using the same public key

User<5091884976>: My Tonhub Address https://tonhub.com/transfer/EQDep8fGr4wvrHMdP4RZo21JShQkHW41Q67cVasEP4xExe1F

Witer33: I saw getBlockTransactions returns only short transactions, without the amount of TON. Whenever I need to check multiple wallets should I send multiple getTransactions requests for every address (if I find a tx with that address in the block)?

ej: Is there anyone that has information about getgems.io   I need some one who had practically done nft in that platform

ej: I dont need the acount of suport team (reply to 2736)

Slava: You can actually fetch a single transaction by specifying it's ID on the API request to getTransactions() (reply to 2735)

Witer33: Yes but the ratelimit remains the same (reply to 2738)

Witer33: üòÖ

Slava: You can always put them in the queue for gradual processing.

Slava: Or you can run your own TonCenter instance.

isoscele üíé: is this a good approx of what happens when we send a simple transaction using v3?

‚Äî 2022-04-18 ‚Äî

Artem: Hello. I found an interesting behavior of wallet clients. I tried to create wallet via TonHub, TonKeeper and wallet.ton.org. TonHub and TonKeeper generated the same address, but the wallet.ton.org gave me other address when using the same mnemonic phrase. Can someone explain why?

Slava: This quickly becomes a question #1 :) (reply to 2753)

Artem: :) Is it in FAQ?

Artem: Maybe different version of the wallet is used?

Artem: Can you explain why it happens? (reply to 2754)

Slava: Sorry, I was distracted. The reason for this is that address depends on the wallet contract version being used.

Slava: Also, one address could be represented in various formats.

Artem: Thank you, it seems that wallet.ton.org uses v3R2, and TonHub uses v4. Is it safe to use v4? (reply to 2759)

Slava: v4 allows you to install plugins, so it could be a doorway for security issues if used wrong. If you don't need the advanced features you should better use v3. (reply to 2761)

Artem: Okay, thank you.

·Ö†: Be careful using web wallet there was recently a site wallet-ton.org showing the  wallet and stealing passwords then emptying accounts. A web wallet is a very hot wallet in my view. We need some better security features for it. (reply to 2761)

Artem: Oh, thanks I'll consider that (reply to 2766)

·Ö†: Safest would be MacOS or Linux or mobile TONcoin v3 wallets in my view. (reply to 2767)

Artem: Tonhub and tonkeeper?

J: what do you guys think of these, do those safe? (reply to 2770)

·Ö†: This is a serious issue in many cases where eg TONkeeper wallet is used again on another device or reinstalled prior to taking a new subscription the version will be 3 again and the user thinks all their coin have been lost. (reply to 2759)

J: omg, that's a very serious issue (reply to 2772)

·Ö†: No they‚Äôre not safe because there are not sufficient UI UX safety features. It‚Äôs a long story but for now still to TONcoin wallet on mobiles. (reply to 2771)

Artem: It seems tonkeeper uses v4. Because it generates the same address as tonhub. Good thing is tonhub detects old versions. (reply to 2772)

J: geeeez, I'm still using tonkeeper, omg I must switch it now. (reply to 2774)

Artem: U mean we should use this app (reply to 2774)

Artem: https://ton.app/wallets/android-ton-wallet

·Ö†: They both do. But anyone other than experts better stick to TONcoin. V3. No you‚Äôre not going to easily lose your coins in TONkeeper it‚Äôs more of UX issues. Tonhub yes more risk to actually lose coins because of buttons. (reply to 2775)

J: I used to use this one, I know it's official, but it's a bit slow and buggy, thus I switched. (reply to 2778)

Artem: Isn't it the same as wallet.ton.org?

J: Thanks for the clarification, cause I recommended almost all my family and friends to use tonkeeper. (reply to 2779)

Artem: I have a constant issue with tonkeeper. If unused for a long time after reopening the app it hangs on the starting screen. I have to kill it and restart it. (reply to 2779)

·Ö†: Maybe do some research. TON site didn‚Äôt have any educational material on wallets but I don‚Äôt want to hog this dev chat. Read previous advice above should be enough. (reply to 2781)

·Ö†: They should be ok (reply to 2783)

Artem: Okay, thanks (reply to 2785)

·Ö†: They may just have panic situations as explained earlier. TONcoin wallet doesn‚Äôt look so sexy but at least the developers haven‚Äôt messed it up yet :D (reply to 2786)

Slava: Try to generate the destination address with the bounce flag off.

Artem: Can someone explain why there are two repos for TON blockchain:  https://github.com/newton-blockchain/ton and https://github.com/ton-foundation/ton?

Slava: The official repos are: - https://github.com/newton-blockchain/ton/ - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton (reply to 2813)

Artem: but what is ton-foundation then?

Artem: Nominator contract source code is hosted there. And there are links from ton.org which lead to the github of the ton-foundation...

Artem: Also https://tondev.org/ there is a link to this chat. There is some kind of confusion. Because it seems that DTF and newton are the same people.

Slava: Can you show me the link on ton.org? (reply to 2816)

Artem: U have to follow link on tonwhales. So it's not a direct link.

Slava: The repository that you've mentioned belongs to Ton Whales (a third-party) and is not related to the TON Foundation.

Artem: so github account "ton-foundation" is owned by tonwhales?

Andrey: Yep, quite right (reply to 2823)

Slava: TON Foundation is an organization behind TON. Ton Whales for some reason just used the name to register their own organization on GitHub.

Andrey: üôÉüòîü§î (reply to 2825)

Artem: It leads to a confusion, because there is a link to tonwhales.com from ton.org. I saw that the nominators contract source code is hosted on the "ton-foundation" github account, which made me think that it's the real TON Foundation.

Artem: BTW few days ago it (the account) was named "tonwhales" (if I do not mistake anything).

Slava: What can I say? The actions of some people are hard to understand ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Artem: Okay, thanks

N: Anyone know discussion platform for blockchain security?

TON technical overview: To be correct, tonwhales are organizing community with the name "decentralized ton foundation" and registered ton-foundation nickname on github for this purpose. (reply to 2823)

Artem: Okay, so DTF was initiated by tonwhales?

Andrey: + (reply to 2834)

Artem: I noticed that main contributor (tolya-yanot) is also contributing to "ton" hosted on "ton-foundation" account and newton account. So there are people from original TON Foundation contributing to DTF?

Andrey: üòÇ, it's not correct. This is just fork of original repo (reply to 2836)

Artem: oh, i see, but why it wasn't forked via github?

TON technical overview: No, for some reason ton repository was copied with tolya-yanot's (ano others) commits instead of forking. DTF doesn't include TF members (reply to 2836)

Artem: Okay, thank you for the information.

Slava: This chat is for development questions, not for mining.

zz: hiÔºå I've tried it and it still can't be sent (reply to 2805)

Slava: Then I would suggest you to create an issue with detailed explanation of your problem. (reply to 2856)

zz: Are forwarding inactive addresses and forwarding active addresses signed differently (reply to 2857)

zz: I think it might be the signature

DPZ: Hi everyoneüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏èüòá

DPZ: Can someone tell me the connection between ton and telegram? Are you one and the same?

Slava: Only development questions please. (reply to 2864)

DPZ: This is a dev question in connection with does Ton have custom minting, smart contracts, etc. and is it actually telegram blockchain you‚Äôre building on?

Slava: TON was invented by Dr. Durov at Telegram and was later open-sourced. This is the one and only TON.

DPZ: Just to be clear this https://ton.org/ and this chat group is the right place (reply to 2867)

Slava: Yes (reply to 2869)

DPZ: This dev team can upgrade telegram as well because telegram is also open sourced or their separate entities on same blockchain? Or neither?

Slava: I don't get the question. Telegram messenger has nothing to do with TON blockchain. There are some integrations made by the enthusiasts, but that's pretty much all. (reply to 2871)

·Ö†: They aren‚Äôt connected. Telegram is a messenger on servers in the cloud. It‚Äôs not open source. It‚Äôs developers aren‚Äôt known to us. TON is a blockchain open source with many developers known to us. The only connection is that originally TON was created by telegram before giving up ownership and ceased all involvement and TON went open source. You can find all this information at ton.org please study materials there. This chat is for developers questions about TON not Telegram. (reply to 2871)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: msg_body (last line) should be: 0x00000000 + comment_in_hex  Alternatively, remove store_slice(msg_body) and store comment directly: .store_uint(0, 32) .store_slice(comment) (reply to 2915)

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Alternatively - I mean "produces the same outcoming message with a different code"

–ò–≥–æ—Ä—å: Yes, although the previous line: .store_uint(0, 1) can also be considered a part of message body, because you might store the body as a cell instead: .store_uint(1, 1) .store_ref(msg_body_cell)

Witer33: I got an issue with getTransactions endpoint of Toncenter (testnet).  using the lt of the most recent transaction as the lt parameter, and the hash of the most recent transaction as the hash parameter, it should return all the transactions after this tx, instead it's returning all the transactions, including older transactions.

Witer33: should I open an issue on GH?

TON technical overview: You mean that it returns transaction which is older than specified? Or that list of transactions also includes after one? Both behaviours are intentional, but not well documented (reply to 2958)

Witer33: What's the point of lt and hash params if the API still returns older txs? (reply to 2960)

Witer33: it should return only newer ones edit: apparently it returns only older ones, then why on DOCS it says "Logical time of transaction to start with, must be sent with hash."

Slava: Because reading TON docs is just too easy in dark mode :) (reply to 2973)

ùó£ùóπùòÇùòÅùóº: Is there any active wallet or Underdevelopment project to support trading in Indian currency ( INR).

Slava: This is not a development question. You can use any exchange that supports TON to trade. E.g. OKX. (reply to 2976)

isoscele üíé: Some fast questions to this header of wallet-v3.fif: 1) Does the last 3 bits 100 of the first slice stand for addr_extern? 2) Why are there only 2 bits after "0 gram" instead of the classic 107 zeros? Where is stored created_at, created_lt, etc in this case?

Vitor: Good afternoon, yesterday I made a withdrawal of the ton coin to my wallet on ftx, it turns out that the amount has not arrived until today and I already checked the address and there is nothing wrong!

Vitor: does anyone know how to solve?

TEP: Did u include the mark ? (reply to 2986)

Slava: Hello! This chat is only for development questions. Try to ask in the general chat. (reply to 2985)

TEP: Ok (reply to 2988)

TON technical overview: No, you are looking at the wrong constructor int_msg_info. Instead you should check ext_in_msg_info: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/block/block.tlb#L127  So 1000100 stands for 10 -tag  00 - addr_none 100 part of the addr_std (reply to 2979)

Vitor: what is the general chat link? (reply to 2988)

Slava: https://t.me/toncoin_chat (reply to 2991)

User<1182105229>: hi guys, can someone explain, what data is stored inside slice at the input?

isoscele üíé: Oh i see! I still dont get the last 100 part. U referring to addr_std$10 ? (reply to 2990)

TON technical overview: 10 - addr_std tag, addional 0 - is from Maybe Anycast. zero means that there is no anycast (check Maybe definition) (reply to 2995)

–Æ—Ä–∏–π: Good morning

Artem: Can someone tell what is y = 2?

TON technical overview: It is a typo, there should be mode (reply to 3023)

Artem: Oh, okay. Can you explain how Bit +2, Bit + 4, Bit + 8 works. How can can we distinguish let's say mode = 0 from mode = 0 + 2?

Artem: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/docs/pull/33 (reply to 3025)

Artem: Is store_coins a synonym for the store_grams?

TON technical overview: Yes (reply to 3031)

TON technical overview: Thanks (reply to 3028)

Artem: Thank you (reply to 3033)

Artem: What is the default smart-contract data?

Artem: If it wasn't set using set_data

Andrew: storage data is set at the deployment stage (reply to 3036)

Artem: Thx

Artem: What does "vanity contract" means? See deployment section https://github.com/ton-foundation/ton-nominators

Vardan: https://github.com/ton-foundation/ton-nominators

Andrew: https://github.com/ton-foundation/vanity-contract This is a way to pick up a vanity address) like a EQCkR1cGmnsE45N4K0otPl5EnxnRakmGqeJUNua5fkWhales (ends in Whales) (reply to 3041)

Artem: Thank you (reply to 3046)

Artem: Is there any documentation how to use it? (reply to 3046)

Andrew: It seems not. (reply to 3048)

Artem: Why vanity contract is required for the nominators contracts? Why can't we use regular address?

Andrew: Perhaps because in the nominators contract is no "randomizer" of addresses  as a public key. (reply to 3050)

Artem: I didn't get your explanation. Can you explain it more precisely? (reply to 3051)

Dario: A vanity address is just a regular address, but they made a brute force to generate a lot of keypairs until they get an address that end with whales (reply to 3050)

Artem: Yep, I was thinking the same way. It seems to me that you can use any address for the contract. (reply to 3053)

Dario: Yes sure (reply to 3055)

Artem: Thank you

Pablo: Sorry, newbie here. What is TON account?. I got an api key and have a wallet, but I'm trying to test the API and don't know what to put. Thanks in advance.

Slava: TON account is just a more general term for a contract instance. E.g. your wallet is an account. Addresses are used to uniquely identify the accounts. (reply to 3074)

Slava: Please keep the conversation in English

Slava: Russian chat is available here: @tondev

–ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Hello everyone, help me get a tone or earn it, where to write codes, how can I get it through tasks, tell me, teach me.

Slava: ton.org has a learn section. This would be a great place to start. (reply to 3085)

Dario: btw tondev broke with runGetMethod and tvm.Slice in the stack (on testnet, where the patch should be implemented)

Dan: What error code? (reply to 3089)

Dan: And how to reproduce?

Dario: gateway error  Error: response status is 504 (reply to 3091)

Dario: curl -X 'POST' \   'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/runGetMethod' \   -H 'accept: application/json' \   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \   -d '{   "address": "EQCD39VS5jcptHL8vMjEXrzGaRcCVYto7HUn4bpAOg8xqB2N",   "method": "get_wallet_address",   "stack": [ [ "tvm.Slice", {"data":{"b64":"te6ccsEBAQEAJAAAAEOAEHv6qlzG5TaOX5eZGIvXmM0i4EqxbR2OpPw3SAdB5jUQkykYFg=="}}     ]   ] }' (reply to 3091)

Dario: pretty sure that im serializing the address wrong, but i did not expect that this can break tvm_valuetypes (?)

Dan: tvm.Slice accepts string with serialized base64 boc, not json (reply to 3093)

Dan: Yea, tvm_valuetypes is not resistant to wrong payloads (reply to 3094)

Dario: still this need to be fixed (?) (reply to 3095)

Dario: wait (reply to 3095)

Dan: You probably need to replace tvm.Slice with simple ‚Äúslice‚Äù

Dan: And also json should be stringified

Dan: And it should have ‚Äúlen‚Äù field in data

Dario: why a nested stringfied json (reply to 3100)

Dan: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø (reply to 3102)

Artem: What is an "adnl_addr" in elector contract? Is it IP address of validator node?

Dario: done, thanks seems to work (reply to 3100)

Dan: It is exactly ADNL address of machine in network, not IP (reply to 3104)

Serge: I made a PR for tonweb https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/pull/45/files today. I think you can get an idea out of it how tvm.Slice should be passed. (reply to 3093)

Dario: oh nice, i was about to make one by myself. thanks, i hope they will patch mainnet soon too (reply to 3107)

Serge: Yes, they have been aware of it already. Hopefully they will make it in the nearest time as this thing is very important for the jetton flow.

Artem: Where can I read more about the ADNL address? How actual routing is performed, by that I mean how IP address of machine is detected by ADNL address. (reply to 3106)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): News:  Released the first utility token: XTON.  A wrapped Toncoin token, which can be traded on his own swap. There is also a testnet version. This token will be used for trading pairs on the upcoming Tonox Dex. Here you can find the source code.  Note: this contract has not been audited (yet), nor formally verified. Use at your own risk.

Tom: What programming language are you guys deving?

‚Äî 2022-04-21 ‚Äî

Artem: Hello. Am I right that mytonctrl is using locally stored private key to send stakes? It means that it acts as a hot wallet. IMHO, it is a high risk to store so much coins in a hot wallet. Is there any way to use a contract to hold all the money and use mytonctrl to send messages to that contract and the contract will send stakes to the elector?

Slava: The wallet IS a contract :) (reply to 3134)

Artem: Yes, but you can move all money from it using a move coins command. And it can be done by using local pk. I don't want that that. (reply to 3135)

Artem: I would like to be able to move coins using some secure wallet.

Artem: Which is not controlled by mytonctrl.

Artem: In short, I would like to use custom contract in mytonctrl instead of the wallet generated by default.

Slava: I guess you will need to write a very specific custom contract if you would like to have various access levels and multiple keys.

Artem: I understand that. Currently I'm worried that mytonctrl stores private key locally which can be used to withdraw all the money. If a server gets compromised and private key is stolen, you will lose all the money. Am I right?

Slava: I'm afraid I will need to leave this question to a people well versed in validators. I don't want to speculate.

Slava: But your assumption sounds reasonable.

Artem: Okay, thank you for your efforts

Slava: You could also look into the nominators implementation. There should be some security measures, like funds delegation. This could set you on the right track.

Artem: I examined their contract. They use controller contract (which is not published) to perform all stake operations, and only owner (not published) contract can perform critical operations. But I do not know if they are using mytonctrl to run the actual node or just a regular full node, which should act as a validator if it finds its public key in the elector lists. (reply to 3145)

Artem: If there is someone from whales corp. Maybe, he could give an explanation.

Artem: In my opinion those contracts should be publicly available, but for some reason they are not.

Slava: I was under the impression that their solution was open sourced. Well, too bad.

Artem: It is, partly. (reply to 3149)

Artem: Only the pool and proxy contracts are published. Maybe controller and owner are just a regular wallets (too me it seems quite true) that's why they were not published.

User<5355480672>: üëã (reply to 3117)

Slava: In any case I would appreciate it if you would share your findings in the future. That is a good question.

Aeen: Dear valued customer,   Thank you for contacting us. Firstly, we are sorry to hear that you are facing with difficulty in accessing your TONCOIN balance.   Pertaining to the query, please be informed that TONCOIN token is having migration from TONCOIN to TON token which has taken place on 20th April 2022. All activities related to this token will be suspended (such as deposit/withdrawal and trading) and your asset balance will not be shown since the real market price cannot be retrieved during the migration.   However, please do not worry as the asset valuation will be back to normal once the migration has been completed. In the meantime, we are unable to provide a  specific timeframe for the completion but we will surely make an announcement once everything has been completed and stable. As for the migration news, we advice you to read our article that has been published for further clarification  this msg came from OkeyEX

Slava: Hey! The TonCenter API only provides low-level features. You will need a library to create a wallet code. One such library is TonWeb for JavaScript. (reply to 3221)

Phosfor: Hello everybody . Got a question! Is it possible to write smart contract for renting nft, for example its sending on other wallet ,but those who rent cant sell it , only send it back ?

Slava: @dvlkv hey! Can you chime in please? (reply to 3228)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): Sure, just create a proxy contract which will be the owner of the nft (reply to 3236)

Dan: Source code of our nominators pool is available here. (reply to 3228)

Phosfor: Yep, but if this is gamefi nft (Skin for example), not sure that those who rented will be allow to the game with a proxy contranct nft or not? (reply to 3238)

Dan: We are using mytonctrl, like a regular validators (reply to 3227)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): Yeah, you need to care also about this logic.   Or you can create a custom nft token with this logic which "fake" the ownership if its rented (reply to 3240)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): But you cant use official ntfs contracts, you have to write your own (and make sure its a standard one)

Phosfor: Uff strange thing) (reply to 3243)

Phosfor: Thank you mate

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): Nothing dude

Artem: But mytonctrl stakes using local wallet balance... Did you change that part? (reply to 3241)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Hi guys. What is the easiest way to prove TON-wallet ownership?  Almost all cryptowallets have ‚Äúsign message‚Äù functionallity to sing text using private key, but I wasn‚Äôt able to find such thing in TON cryptowallets. Maybe it will be added in the future?  P.S. Example of using ‚Äúsing message‚Äù to prove wallet ownership: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zanbc1KYLiw

Artem: It's just a regular cryptography. You can easily sign any message if you have private key or public key and known algorithm. It is not related to blockchain. (reply to 3249)

Slava: Send some unique predefined message from the wallet using transfer. (reply to 3249)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: I know it, but I would like to find user-friendly way to do it (e.g. sign a message using the UI and send the signature to the web service you want to verify ownership of) (reply to 3250)

Slava: The public key must be shared somehow for this to work. (reply to 3250)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: sounds üëç  I‚Äôll check it out, thanks (reply to 3251)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: Is there problem in sharing your public key to some web-service? (reply to 3253)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): const signature = await window.ton.send(                     'ton_rawSign',                     [{                         data: 'RAWDATA'                     }]                 ); (reply to 3256)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): This is how you can sign message via ton web wallet

Artem: Ofcourse (reply to 3253)

Slava: And even if you know the public key, it is not that trivial to verify if it corresponds to the specific account. (reply to 3259)

Artem: It's true (reply to 3261)

Artem: With ethereum wallets we used some sophisticated mechanism to derive public address from signed message.

smbydk: Hi everyone! Could someone help me find out how to locate every NFT which is owned by specific address via API? Is it even possible? I never worked with blockchains before so I lack a lot of technical knowledge there.  Thanks in advance!

RocketMan: not possible via blockchain and there is no API that allows to do it for now (reply to 3265)

RocketMan: basically to solve this problem someone should index every block, find out which nfts are minted and add them to some local index.  and make api for it for example or use this data later  you cannot simply ask blockchain

RocketMan: there is also second option that can partially solve problem.  you can check all data about collection and nfts inside if you know collection address  so you could index popular collections or ask user to provide address for collection if they own some nft and want to see it in your service

smbydk: Thanks for detailed answer! I appreciate it. (reply to 3268)

zz: hi Given the transaction hash of out, can we know the corresponding transaction hash of in @slavafomin

D: whats the minimum amount of token needed to run a validator?

D: is it still 10k?

D: i remember reading on the website stating that the to run a validator needed a minimum of 10k TON and the rest of the token can be from the nominators ?

RocketMan: yes, but there is no magic in the world. You need to attract these nominators somehow, nobody will just give you the rest of tokens. So I would say that you still need full load of tokens (300k or so) to run it, only after that people could come.  also you need to deploy nominators contract (reply to 3298)

D: Ah okay, let me do more research on it. So just having 10k token is not enough to start a validator i suppose? hardware aside (reply to 3299)

Slava: TON address is mostly a hash of the state init, which consists of the contract code and data. Therefore address represents the code of the contract and could be used to verify it.

User<5327772610>: I had a failed transaction using the bridge, is there a way to either retry the transaction or get my Ton coin back?

Arvin: hello everybody

Arvin: how create token jetton in toncoin network?

User<5327772610>: Does anyone know if the ETH bridge returns TON back to your wallet if the contract transaction fails on the ETH side?

Slava: Contact the @ton_help_bot (reply to 3362)

User<5327772610>: Thank you for the info. (reply to 3364)

isoscele üíé: So watching the ton address (the one we send money to) we can understand what type of contract it is? üò± (reply to 3343)

User<5355480672>: Hello (reply to 3303)

Gabor: Hey guys. Somebody can help me why i dont see in de TonBoot my hasrate from de minner?

Gabor: Maybe iam not in the good place i see now. Support can i find somewhere?

Artem: üòÆ  1. Does it mean that a contract does not have a private key?  2. Will it's address change in case of source code update?  3. Is it possible to update storage data via set_code or only source code will be updated? (reply to 3343)

Slava: 1. Public key is part of the data, so contract is tied to your private key and the address depend on it as well.  I'm not too sure about the other two points, so I won't speculate. The contract developers will be able to answer it better. (reply to 3374)

Artem: Oh, i see (reply to 3375)

Dario: 2. Nope 3. No, to update "storage" you need to use set_data (reply to 3374)

Artem: Thank you (reply to 3379)

Dario: Also dont think too much about private/public keys. Thats how wallet works because there are primitives to check signatures, but in fact you can do anything, you can even accept message externally just by some condition (reply to 3380)

Artem: üëç (reply to 3381)

‚Äî 2022-04-23 ‚Äî

isoscele üíé: So one of the checks that happen when the owner interacts with the smartcontract is the signature check: TVM loads the signature from the in_msg (512 bit) and compares it with the encrypted (with public_key of smart contract) of the hash of the message arrived minus the first 512 bit. If the signature equals the encrypt(hash(in_msg[512:])) the check is passed. Right?

Arvin: ? (reply to 3361)

Slava: Try looking at these examples: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/test-jetton.js (reply to 3361)

RocketMan: https://t.me/CryptoBotEnglish (reply to 3477)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): I honestly do not suggest to use crypto api, for two reasons: first, the fees are huge, second its not worth it because the user must use a centralized wallet (even if its a good service), but we already have a fast and low fees blockchain. To receive a payment just generate a random string that identify an user and scan the wallet using getTransactions api from toncenter (reply to 3471)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): If you want to make payments, there are libs for js (tonweb or tonmadelinejs), go or even php using madelinephp (reply to 3407)

RocketMan: your coins in your wallet don't need to be migrated, nothing changed everywhere but inside okex (reply to 3496)

Christopher: Really? That's great news (reply to 3497)

Succubus: Greetings guys, I think it is not the right place but I do not know where to ask, I am trying to make a deposit in the OKX exchange but it tells me that the network does not work, I have looked in FTX for example and it uses the ERC20 network, is there another exchange that can use with the Toncoin network?

Slava: You are right. This is the wrong place to ask. Please use the general TON chat. (reply to 3508)

Succubus: The other two official channels are blocked from writing, which one are you referring to? (reply to 3509)

Slava: https://t.me/toncoin_chat (reply to 3510)

·Ö†: Question: it seems to usually take around 15 seconds for a TON transaction payment from one wallet address to another. I understood from ton.org/analysis that this should take less than 6 seconds? Why does it take ca. 15 seconds? And is this a quite fixed duration, even if the number of transactions goes up 100 times the current number per second, it will remain at 15 seconds or be longer? I measure the time from when I hit send on the wallet, to when it arrives at a constantly refreshing blockchain explorer page for destination wallet.

Slava: It takes around 5 seconds for each block to be mined in TON. However, your transaction must find its way to the block using the TON network, a network of nodes. Like any network it doesn't work instantly. And there a nodes that work better than the others. So it explains the duration. (reply to 3512)

·Ö†: Is there any comparison to other cryptocurrency networks, in other words, is TON still faster than all of them given the above? (reply to 3513)

·Ö†: The nodes may also depend on my location. If I am in the DPRK for example, and go via a VPN to Japan, then it may be slower than sending between two wallets in Germany, is that correct?

Slava: I'm not aware of such comparison. And it won't be very fair even if it existed, because the network conditions could change drastically very often. (reply to 3514)

Slava: I'm not an expert in TON networking, but I would guess that it would depend on your location relative to the location of other TON nodes, especially the validators. (reply to 3515)

·Ö†: This brings to another question, decentralisation: we have no way to know for sure, I guess, the physical locations of validators. Assuming there are more in NAM, EU, URS, but none of few in most of Africa, Myanmar, Laos, etc, so if any of those countries close their internet or throttle it to the world wide pipes (as has happened on occasions even in developed countries such as Egypt, Thailand, etc), what effects would this have on TON transactions? Can they still in fact take place, or does it require a validator within reach? 2) Would the introduction of TON Web somehow improve upon those censorship possibilities? If anyone has any ideas, it would be appreciated, as it is a question I've been asked a few times already.

Slava: That would depend on the entry point. When sending the transaction you still need to connect to at least one node or a proxy server like TonCenter. If your Internet is blocked you won't be able to reach the nodes, besides using the VPN. (reply to 3518)

Slava: Nodes are just servers with their IPs and stuff.

·Ö†: Is there some way that those of us who are in such locations, which are subject to such closing of internet pipes (and the population at large is really not much affected by it as they mostly only use national services), can do without being validators, to help mitigate or improve that situation? I.E. operation of a node would be doable with less resources? If this information is in the known documentation, just refer me to read it again with this in mind)) (reply to 3519)

·Ö†: I imagine that TON Proxy may be a big help in this regard when it comes out?

Slava: I would guess that setting up a node with the good communication channels, e.g. good VPN connection (or multiple back-up connections) would help. But still, I'm not an expert in this subject. (reply to 3521)

Alex: is there a way to close Ton Wallet extension from code?

·Ö†: Is there any reason NOT to use v3 addresses to receive coin? They will work just as well receiving?

TON technical overview: There is no strings (as a type) in TVM and in funC as well (reply to 3708)

I: https://ton.org/docs/#/func/stdlib?id=string_hash

I: and then what is it?

TON technical overview: Any wallet will work as it is programmed regardless of anything else. The only thing that may change is that some software may not support some versions. But there is no signs that v3 will not be supported (reply to 3719)

TON technical overview: I indeed misread your message. Store_hash will hash bytes stored in slice. So if you store less than 128 byte bytestring into slice and use sha256u in TVM you should get the same result as hashing this bytestring with sha256 hash (reply to 3722)

·Ö†: As I thought. The reason I ask is the OKX migration TONCOIN-TON debacle. Finally after a week we can withdraw. Withdrew as usual to usual v3 address. Never before any problems. This time Received 3 emails confirmed withdrawal approved and not pending. Half hour later still not on blockchain. The help page in such cases says to contact the receiving blockchain.  The only difference was I used single letter comment but TON doesn‚Äôt require comment anyway. I suspect OKX system is somehow at fault. (reply to 3723)

The difference is in who will bear the burden of complexity: 1) When you have one deposit address and distinguish users by comment, you need to   a) ask users to use only wallets which can generate transfers with comments (so no deposits from general DAPPs)   b) it is more difficult for user to check that money arrived (for instance, when using deposit address as donation address: other people will deposit to it)   c) dealing with user's mistakes (no memo, etc) but   d) you just check transactions only on one address and manage funds on it 2) When you have individual deposit address for each user   a) User may deposit to his address the way he wants   b) Easy to check whole history of deposits but   c) deposit system should keep eye on many addresses and manage transfers separately which is more difficult (reply to 3770)

TON technical overview: TON uses special way of data structure for storing everything called Cells.

If you have somee ideas what to implement, please let me know :)   It supports connection with multiple lite servers in the same time, have queries balancing and concurrent safe.

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): if you want, you can try to make a simple proxy server, and then compile the lib for wasm so it can be used for dapps (reply to 3870)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): it would be a true liteclient in the browser

Oleg: Interesting idea, ty :) Isn‚Äôt web lite client exists already? (reply to 3871)

Roman: IMPROVED JETTON SMART CONTRACT üìÉ  Friends and colleagues! It has long been no secret to many of you that the BITON team has done a lot of work on DEX and the token standard.  Soon we will show you the MVP DEX, but even now our team is ready to present you something new - a modified minter of tokens with ICO üéâ  We have carried out a complete refactoring of the source code of the token minter and added ICO functionality to it. And, of course, our standard works perfectly and is fully compatible with the original one. üôåüèª  Q: So what did you do? üßê  A: Firstly, a complete refactoring of the code. The code has become much clearer and more readable!  Secondly, we have limited the mint of new tokens.  Now a little bit about the ICO functionality and its impact:  - the ability to purchase tokens by sending TONs directly to the smart contract; - we‚Äôve fixed a bug with old wallets that indicated that there was a comment for transaction even if was none; - added limits for ICO time and number of tokens; - the ability to withdraw coins by the creator from the ICO minter; - fifth scripts for testnet & mainnet deploy.  Our repository is always at your service: https://github.com/BITONdev/btn-token-smc  Stay tuned. ü§™ (forwarded from Polus Ecosystem Announcements)

User<5203100492>: Where's The DEX?  While the community has its eyes on NFTs ü¶©, the fight for dominance on the DEX market had already begun ‚öîÔ∏è.   Decentralized exchanges are a must-have mechanism for any chain ‚Äì demonstrating hundreds of $millions in trading volume. This May, there'll be more than a few jettons ü™ô that need to be traded, and more than a few DEXes that will handle it.  We're aware of three DEXes in active development üèó by three teams: BITON, Tegro, and Tonox. The first one promises to drop an MVP in a matter of days, the second one announced its plans just recently, while the third one had already begun mainnet trading (yet with poor design and only one jetton on the list ‚Äì its own token).  Unlike CEXes, decentralized platforms will make it easier for projects to get their jettons out there. Running a DEX will also open a whole new world of opportunities like liquidity pools ü©±, governance üëë, staking, lend/borrow ‚Äì everything to make DeFi possible on TON. And the competition for the no.1 DEX title gets stronger every day as we watch it üëÄ (forwarded from CoinCrackerNews)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): so, there is no dex on mainnet, yet

Pee: Is there any site that lists all tokens currently on mainnet?? Are there even any tokens?

Slava: You should probably avoid anything that says everscale in it. (reply to 4199)

Slava: At least if you have no experience to make such judgement yourself.

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): no, for now some token appaered on the blockchain but they are just ripoff of official smart contracts and they are not even suitable for dexs (for example, you shouldnt issue the entire supply via an ico) (reply to 4203)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): soon you will be able to trade tokens on tonox.exchange

RocketMan: well it is not an issue. it is how ton works. there is no "TRANSACTION". every transaction is two messages (reply to 4273)

Will it start to generate rewards from the next election cycle and how many hours would it take? 3. When will it take to withdraw my previously staked TON? 4. Do I need to claim the staking rewards manually or the rewards will be distributed automatically? 5. Is there a maximum amount restriction for TON staking?

Kang: Hi guys, does anyone know how to figure out the decimal scale for ton balance from getBalance?

Vardan: Hi guys, I would like to ask, how much size is ton blockchain size?  https://github.com/neodiX42/MyLocalTon/blob/main/screens/MyLocalTon-alpha-demo.gif

Vova: hello, I'm trying to automate the payment in my bot, can you tell me how to access the api correctly?  Do I need to separately launch a function that will parse transactions after a period of time, or is there another way?

Slava: You should query the Blockchain for data regarding your transactions. Are you using a single address or multiple addresses for payments?

Vova: I use one address.  now I get a json file from the api/v2 link every 30 seconds, but sometimes I get an error about frequent requests.  I also ran into the problem of simultaneously launching the bot and the parsing function

Slava: You should start your own TonCenter instance in your infrastructure. The public server has strict RPS limits.

Slava: What kind of errors do you have with the bot?

Vova: I found the TON API BOT bot, they gave me some kind of key, but I didn‚Äôt understand why (reply to 4472)

Vova: There are no problems with the bot, there is only ignorance of how to simultaneously launch the bot and an endless loop in which parsing will take place (this is my 1 bot, I'm currently learning) (reply to 4473)

Slava: I would suggest you to run a payment confirmation routine as a separate process. This approach will be more scalable.

Slava: Look for microservice architecture and horizontal scalability.

Vova: understood thanks (reply to 4477)

Vova: and where to go so that you can make more requests? (reply to 4472)

Slava: Read here: https://github.com/slavafomin/tonweb/tree/better-docs#toncenter-api (reply to 4480)

Slava: If you are just starting you can use the public TonCenter with the API key.

Vova: thanks, I'll try now

sorry for: same question (reply to 4485)

talkol: Hi fellow smart contract developers. It took me a long time to figure out FunC and get a decent development environment with automated tests and a deployment script.  I ended up creating a starter project - a template with all the boilerplate of how to get a good form project going:  https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts  Take a look and star this repo if you find it useful. Feedback welcome in issues.

Artem: Really good job! (reply to 4495)

Artem: I think it would be good to create separate package for deploy and test helpers, and install them as dependencies for this starter template. Also I've noticed that it is not cross-platform. Maybe you should get rid off the bash scripts? Also, fift executables should be distributed from official repo. (reply to 4495)

Armen: Could you guys advise what if I have 350k of TON, to whom I should write to get a validator approved?

Kirill: Can I use FunC to solve https://projecteuler.net/ tasks ?

talkol: Isn‚Äôt it permissionless? I don‚Äôt think you need to tell anyone, if you have stake you participate (reply to 4505)

Kirill: i.e. is there a console application for that?

Kirill: thank you for sharing that! (reply to 4495)

talkol: Yes, I definitely plan to make the build and deploy scripts separate libraries after collecting some feedback on building and deploying complex projects. The project should be cross platform, the bash is only to support Glitch online IDE.   I don‚Äôt have a Windows machine and I‚Äôll be happy if somebody can tell me if everything is working there (reply to 4504)

Artem: mytonctrl (reply to 4508)

Kirill: thx (reply to 4511)

talkol: Distributing fift executables is difficult from the official repo since they‚Äôre missing many architectures (like Mac M1 and Ubunutu 16). So I had to create my alternatives, but I provide links to the official too if somebody prefers to take from there

Artem: - It will break on postinstall 100% - deploy:testnet will also break (reply to 4510)

talkol: Good point! what breaks deploy testnet? (reply to 4514)

talkol: The paths?

Artem: There is no export command in windows (reply to 4515)

talkol: It‚Äôs a shame I can‚Äôt run Windows on docker, will be so much easier to test. I‚Äôll get a laptop from a friend and make sure it‚Äôs cross platform

Artem: in powershell you can set ENV variables using $env:VARIABLE = 1

Artem: You can run windows using VM. (reply to 4518)

Artem: i.e. https://www.virtualbox.org/ (reply to 4520)

talkol: All the bash stuff is just for Glitch it doesn‚Äôt need to run at all on Windows, I‚Äôll fix it no worries (reply to 4519)

J: Hi,Does anyone know what happened to the validator this morning?

talkol: I‚Äôm planning to complete two other starter projects that will go side by side. One for a web client in React and one for a telegram bot that interacts with the contract.

J: I've taken the screenshot from tonwhale this morning and saw the POS minting went really wrong.

J: Now is getting back to normal, but it's still pending, does anyone knows what happened?

J: I just got a scammer who texted me, omg....

J: someone from this Dev chat.

SBB: They're everywhere (reply to 4536)

J: ya, you are right, I just checked his  name in this chat, he ran away, but he properly would use another account. üòÆ‚Äçüí® (reply to 4537)

SBB: One of them was a phisher I presented him an empty account he blocked me ü•∫ (reply to 4538)

Slava: Please keep the conversation to the development subject.

J: Yes, how about the validator issue? (reply to 4542)

Slava: Could you explain the issue in more details?

SBB: Please give me some tips on how should I connect to a block without server requirement and node setting up (reply to 4542)

J: The validators went wrong in this morning, all the POS minting became only half of what it should have. (reply to 4545)

J: Here is the screenshot I took this morning. (reply to 4533)

SBB: @slavafomin is it possible to connect directly for getting balance and sending deposit at all? (reply to 4546)

J: I even checked a validator address, they had the same issue.

J: Now it's back to normal, but may I ask what happened to the validators this morning? (reply to 4534)

Slava: I'm not aware of that. You should better ask this question to the pool owners I guess.

SBB: What about me? (reply to 4553)

J: the weird thing is, it happened to 2 different staking pool and a validator. (reply to 4553)

J: if it only happened to a single staking pool, I would definitely think it's the pool owner's problem, that make sense, I'm not really look for trouble or anything, I'm just trouble shooting, hoping to improve the ton community.

J: sorry, cause it contents personal info. I must delete that message above.

Vardan: Hi, I have a question about this link ton://transfer/<wallet_address>?amount=<amount_in_nano>&text=<uuid>  What does it means "amount_in_nano" for example 1 ton, how to convert 1ton to amount_in_nano?

Slava: Thank you for bringing this up. Actually, there was a network condition today, that happens every 3 days by design. All the nodes sync Blockchain state periodically by creating a persistent state in the filesystem. This process takes a lot of system resources, namely RAM. So the servers, with less RAM than optimal could freeze during this period. That what happend with the validators that you've mentioned. We are working on a permanent solution that will help to mitigate the problem. But the validators will need to increase the amount of available RAM if they want to avoid this issue during this time. (reply to 4558)

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): as you can see here, you need to multiply 1 with 1000000000 (reply to 4560)

Slava: You just need to multiple 1 by 10^9. (reply to 4560)

Slava: Also, make sure that you use an appropriate data type that can handle big numbers.

J: Thanks, that's perfectly explained everything, Ton is the best. üöÄ (reply to 4561)

left: I have a question about how the front end connects to the smart contract and how to call the function method of the smart contract? Is there a demo?

Slava: Hey! TON web wallet would be a good example of such application. (reply to 4581)

Slava: It uses a TonWeb, a library that has a lot of functionality to interact with the Blockchain and the contracts.

left: ye, I have used TonWeb.But I don't know if I connect successfully with the contract. (reply to 4585)

left: web3.js can call the contract method through the methods attribute, but I found through the source code that TonWen created a Contract object, and the methods attribute returned an empty object. So how should I call the function method of the smart contract? (reply to 4585)

Slava: I would suggest you to look at the contract implementations shipped with the TonWeb. There are a lot of examples. You will need to implement the Contract yourself and add the required methods to it. (reply to 4588)

Slava: Use the existing classes as a reference.

left: this? (reply to 4590)

left: So I can't directly call the methods of the contract like web3.js, and can only add the required methods through extend? (reply to 4590)

Antons: Guys, be careful of scammers like this:

Antons: Unregistered and unvalidated TON are defenseless during stock market crashing (forwarded from User<5343297515>)

Slava: The idea is to extend the Contract class and to implement the specific behavior of your contract, yes. (reply to 4593)

left: sorry„ÄÇ Do you have a Demo on Github? Or simple ways to invoke smart contracts like Hello World are demo. I don't know exactly how to operate, thank youüòÇüôè (reply to 4616)

Slava: We don't have such contrived examples, but the repository contains implementation for various smart contracts. You should look at them and use them as a reference. (reply to 4617)

Slava: There is a TypeScript version of the codebase, which could be easier to read.

left: Yes, I looked at that wallet, but it doesn't feel like what I want. (reply to 4619)

left: Yes, I have read the code.   But according to the source code, the methods property is an empty object. (reply to 4620)

Slava: If you just need to invoke a contract get-method then you need to call this: https://github.com/slavafomin/tonweb/blob/typescripted/src/http-provider/http-provider.ts#L266

Slava: Consider the Contract as an abstract class. It must be implemented properly, before it can be used. You will need to define your own methods in your sub-class. (reply to 4623)

Slava: Look at this for example: https://github.com/slavafomin/tonweb/blob/typescripted/src/contract/token/nft/nft-collection.ts#L111

Siamak: Hi

Siamak: I had a question I can ask

Siamak: I transferred some currency with toncoin wallet. Now the destination exchange wants the txid code.  Where can I find this code?

Slava: You should better contact the support of the exchange in question. Also, this chat is only for development questions. (reply to 4632)

Slava: It's very uncommon for TON services to use TXID as transfer identification.

Siamak: Please leave the URL of the site you posted again

Rozsafny: Hi All, I just transfered TON to bridge, via smart contract. however nothing happened. after a while when nothing was happening, not even refresh of the page helped. So I hit cancel, however now it seems the coins are lost or will they be returned to original address?

·Ö†: Technical question if I may? After the ‚ÄúTONCOIN to TON migration‚Äù (or fiasco) OKX is doing 200 confirmations for deposits and 500 for withdrawals. This seems crazy? I thought Ton blockchain didn‚Äôt require this? If I‚Äôm right please confirm? Then if so Foundation would need to take this up with OKX on behalf of community. It would explain why withdrawals are taking days. Or is this normal and/or some technical reason for this?

Slava: You are right. TON doesn't require confirmations. I guess it's just a management decision. (reply to 4683)

Slava: It would be easier to study the source code in the TypeScript: https://github.com/slavafomin/tonweb/blob/typescripted/src/contract/contract.ts#L49  It has better documentation and is more readable. (reply to 4705)

Slava: And I would suggest looking at the usage of the class in the sub-classes it would be easier to understand.

·Ö†: Any ideas in layman's language what this means? It occurs from time to time in MacOS Wallet. Will this be a permanent error for that wallet address? What caused it? Is there historic data missing? What effects does it have? It's not a UX friendly message ))

Slava: Don't import symbols using deep paths. The library is designed to import symbols only from its root.

Slava: Are you trying to read old transactions? (reply to 4712)

Slava: Also, if you are making a wallet contract, there is a Wallet class that could suit you better. (reply to 4710)

·Ö†: The wallet would be as it always has a history, I'm just using Wallet as any normal user. When I scroll back sometimes all the history is there, sometimes not, like right now, it only goes back a month, is this the error? But then sometimes it must be working? The error shows up quite often, maybe once a day or more in normal usage. (reply to 4714)

·Ö†: I quit the wallet, started it again, and all history is there without any error message. Whatever causes this error is not UX friendly and would cause users concern. (reply to 4716)

Vasilii: is seqno different, or not? (reply to 4812)

Slava: What you are getting is the hash of the external message. It changes every time, because the content of the message changes as well (it has an expiration date, which changes based on your system clock). (reply to 4812)

Slava: The message and the transaction are two related, but different concepts. And I'm not sure if it's even possible to pre-calculate the transaction hash.

Slava: Why do you need it?

Seek: I need to precompute Hash, because Ton main chain broadcast will not return Hash

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): You can't, just stream the transaction and query outgoing transaction for that address (reply to 4822)

Seek: According to what you said, I just need to change the time in the tonweb project to my own time and pass it in.

Seek: Because the calculated Hash is correct when seqnum is equal to 0, but not correct when seqnum not equal to 0

Dario Tarantini (ex Tonox): What

Seek: createSigningMessage(seqno) {     seqno = seqno || 0;     const message = new Cell();     message.bits.writeUint(this.options.walletId, 32);     if (seqno === 0) {         // message.bits.writeInt(-1, 32);// todo: dont work         for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {             message.bits.writeBit(1);         }     } else {         const date = new Date();         const timestamp = Math.floor(date.getTime() / 1e3);         message.bits.writeUint(timestamp + 60, 32);     }     message.bits.writeUint(seqno, 32);     return message; }

Slava: When seqno = 0 TTL is not used. (reply to 4825)

Seek: This function

Slava: What are you trying to do?

Slava: What is the final goal?

Seek: I fork the tonweb project and change it myself, I feel that the design of the tonweb project is a bit inflexible

Slava: What have you changed? (reply to 4832)

Seek: I want to precompute Hash, consistent with on-chain Hash

Slava: You are not answering my questions. (reply to 4834)

Slava: ^ (reply to 4831)

Seek: haven't changed (reply to 4833)

Seek: just want to do it

Seek: Our wallet needs to pre-calculate the function of Hash. At present, the tonweb project cannot realize this function.

Slava: Okay, good luck with that... = /

Seek: OK

Slava: ^ (reply to 4791)

Nikita: Hm, why is the seed phrase (mnemonic) that is generated by TON libraries (tonweb-mnemonic as example) and wallets not compatible with seed phrases in other blockchains?

talkol: If I remember correctly, the timestamp of the transaction appears on the transaction. The wallets also support a time-out of when the transaction of signed vs when it was processed, so the timestamp must be there to support it (reply to 4812)

User<5032411984>: Announcing Tonic Docs & Introduction to Fift.  The threshold for starting to build on TON is quite high, plus a lack of learning materials and guides makes it spooky for the curious newcomers. Since Tonic's original idea is to simplify all of it, we've been working on a new Tonic rollout: the Tonic Docs library.  Designed to come in handy in every TON dev's routine, Tonic Docs are a list of introductory documents and tutorials to make your building endeavors pleasant ‚Äì especially during the first steps.  Tonic Docs are already available at https://docs.tonic.cx/. Today, we're launching with our first Tonic Doc: Introduction to Fift. This 2500 word intro takes you from Fift newbie to writing your first Fift contract!  Up next, we'll have an exhaustive overview of TON Development Environments, covering TonCLI, MyLocalTON, ton-contract-executor and tonstarter-contracts. Coming soon! Stay tuned.

Mission: I have one last question for Friday.  The white-paper mentions that a block might be invalidated once a "Fisherman" challenge it within 2 months (2.6.28 Recursive reliability of a block). I wonder: - how can an external service detect such situation? The generated vertical blockchain corresponding to that challenged block would be referenced by the next block in masterchain. But how do I, as an external service react to that? Should I poll all owned account states periodically? - does that mean the finality of a block is 2 months? which seems not reasonable ...

talkol: Or the ton library on npm.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton  You can see example of using it in my example project here:  https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts/blob/main/build/main.deploy.ts#L19 (reply to 5297)

talkol: In ton.org they describe time to finality as sub second: (reply to 5305)

talkol: Finality as I understand it is when can external services rely on the data that it wouldn‚Äôt change

talkol: The fisherman case is super edge case like Ethereum doing a hard fork to change history. It‚Äôs not something you should normally prepare for. Services should normally rely on finality and in TON case you need very little confirmations

–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π: hi guys, iam 1 week in writing smart contracts and cant understand how to deploy my smart in mainnet of ton. I installed everdev and use solidity for writing smarts but it offers me only ever dev nets. Guess i should add one more network to network list but i dont know which one, can u help me to prevent mistakes?

Chak: Everdev and solidity sounds like toolset for the Everscale blockchain, while this chat is about TON. You'd better ask in their Dev community. I'm not attaching the links, because I don't know the right chat, but I hope it's easy to just Google them. (reply to 5376)

–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π: thx but it seems like to be not so easy. I wrote to everscale chat and they said that everscale much better than using ton in such words that i couldnt repeat myself...

RocketMan: ever tools don't work with ton out of the box. need to tune them. Writing contracts using ever-solidity is not considered best practice in ton. all smart contracts in ton are written in func language. (reply to 5378)

As I understand it says about Fift https://ton.org/docs/#/smart-contracts/tvm-instructions/instructions?id=_21-basic-stack-manipulation-primitives. Is there something about FunC and gas prices? To be honest I don't understand enough where is the entry point to start coding smart contracts because it's not similar to solidity and more. I feel very stupid when I read ton docs

TON technical overview: Start from here https://ton.org/docs/#/smart-contracts/ Your link is for quite deep level of understanding of funC and tvm (reply to 5586)

hadi: Hi. it seems ton chain supports smart contracts right?

hadi: any plan for adding solidity?

Corben: I need only 5m for my Q

Andrew: Everything in TON is smart contracts.   There are no accounts or wallets like other blockchains. A wallet in TON is a smart contract. (reply to 5699)

Slava: It's planned for 2023. (reply to 5700)

Andrew: Really solidity? (reply to 5703)

Nick: I would say different way. Every address in the network is an account but the way of working with this account is described by a smart-contract deployed to this account. (reply to 5702)

Corben: I have plans to develop a defi project, I need to advise whether it will work correctly on the ton blockchain Who can I discuss with?

Slava: It will be possible for TON to support EVM in a separate workchain. There are no specific details yet and it's not a high priority goal at the moment. (reply to 5704)

Dario: ask here (reply to 5706)

Dario: @CorbenDallas777 in this chat

Andrew: The tblkch.pdf says: a smart contract and an account are the same thing in the context of the TON Blockchain. But TON "accounts" are different from other blockchains. (reply to 5705)

Corben: I can‚Äôt in public (reply to 5709)

Dario: in that case i cant help you

Andrew: Weird question. Is it possible to add EVER as a separate workchain in TON? and vice versa. (reply to 5707)

Andrew: It is possible to make any defi project in TON. Simply there are features in implementation. (reply to 5706)

Corben: I know  That‚Äôs why I ask (reply to 5716)

Alexander: It is. Try to run the command with this address: EQAhE3sLxHZpsyZ_HecMuwzvXHKLjYx4kEUehhOy2JmCcHCT  "account state is empty" means that an address hasn't been initialized yet (reply to 5720)

Alex: The same with your address (reply to 5721)

Alexander: This answers your question: "Why is it possible?"  Basically you have an immense number of addresses but only some of them are initialized as contracts.(e.g. wallets)

Alexander: I would say different way. Every address in the network is an account but the way of working with this account is described by a smart-contract deployed to this account. (forwarded from Nick Nekilov)

Alexander: What the network do you use?  It should work. https://tonscan.org/address/EQAhE3sLxHZpsyZ_HecMuwzvXHKLjYx4kEUehhOy2JmCcHCT

Dmitry: Yes. But this can be done a bit more efficient with skip_bits() (reply to 5761)

left: got it .

left: Because I executed set_data, each contract only corresponds to one cell? (reply to 5762)

Dmitry: Not sure if I got your question right. set_data() stores a cell to c4 register of tvm, which is dedicated to contract data and yes, it is the only of its kind.  Although the cell you put there may have references to other cells. Also, incoming message is a cell, outgoing messages are put in a list of cells, so the data cell is far not the only cell your contract can work with. (reply to 5764)

left: The cell obtained by the get_data method in a func file is the cell that uses set_data in this file. That is, each func file has only one cell? (reply to 5766)

–Ø–∑–æ–Ω: thanks (reply to 5788)

–Ø–∑–æ–Ω: Someone has to fix this.  jsonRPC responds with string  "Rate limit exceeded: 1 per 1 second" and node-fetch used under the hood in tonweb expects JSON. So the error in .catch() statment is "invalid json response body at..." insead of  "Rate limit exceeded: 1 per 1 second"

Kirill: Hey, we are announcing our first grant. This is a huge event for us, on par with the Tonkeeper Release. We want to support the whole TON NFT Community and to develop tools and Open Standards, making experience with NFTs better for everyone. We also think that this is a long awaited feature for everyone involved with TON NFTs: auctions.  So we are announcing our first grant on auction contracts. This is a first attempt for us to release a grant, so we will carefully listen to all the feedback you have in our chat. Please do not hesitate to start and open discussion, we do want to hear your opinion.  We are looking to find a person or a team, which will deliver an auction contracts repository on Github according to the provided technical and product specifications. We think that this work can be done in approximately two weeks. Grant sum is 2.000 TON.  Grant applicants are expected to send a short intro and a cover letter to apply for the grant through our @nfton_bot (please, use the ‚ÄúNeed help‚Äù button on it). We might approve two teams (or separate individuals) to work on this project, to make sure the TON NFT Community gets the best talent working on long-awaited auctions.  Team / Individuals able to provide excellent level of quality might expect to get on fast track to join Getgems team.

left: How to understand asm "21 PUSHINT"

Nick: Like "return 21;" (reply to 6013)

left: got it.   just like const op = 21; (reply to 6014)

Nick: yeah, but more optimized

left: I looked at the documentation, but still don't understand what flags are. And why do &1? What does 1 stand for? (reply to 6016)

Nick: https://ton.org/docs/#/smart-contracts/messages?id=message-layout (reply to 6017)

Nick: It's 1 if flag bounced is turned on.

Dmitry: means least significant bit is true. For these flags it is "bounced" bit (reply to 6017)

left: So the first four bits represent whether the rebound bit, return 0 or 1 (reply to 6021)

left: 1 means true , &1 means only optimized writing (reply to 6020)

left: right?

Aref: üòê (reply to 6024)

left: üßê

TON technical overview: it is actually less optimized than const int op::mint = 21 in some cases and the same in others. When you write expressions like op::mint + 1 when op::mint is const it will be compilled to PUSHINT 22, whe op::mint() is asm code - it will be compilled to PUSHINT 21 INC (reply to 6016)

Nick: Oh, sorry for confusing. I meant that int op::mint() asm "21 PUSHINT"; is more optimized than int op::mint() { return 21; }

Dmitry: Each bit of those 4 has its own meaning. we need only the last one. & is something like bitwise comparison with some mask. 1 here is because we need the last bit. 2 would mean the second least and 4 the third an 8 the fourth. (reply to 6022)

Dmitry: Though I never used such an obscure syntax, so I might be wrong here

Nick: You don't have to read 6 bytes. (reply to 6032)

left: This is from the documentation, so I don't quite understand (reply to 6033)

Nick: Last 2 bytes mean "null address".

Dario: You are reading flags from in_msg_full, while other params are read from in_msg_body (reply to 6035)

Dmitry: First bit is for tag, always 0. Second is for ihr, then bounceable, then bounced bit and the last two are for blank source address (reply to 6032)

Nick: This example contains more information:   var msg = begin_cell()     .store_uint(0, 1) ;; tag     .store_uint(1, 1) ;; ihr_disabled     .store_uint(1, 1) ;; allow bounces     .store_uint(0, 1) ;; not bounced itself     .store_slice(source)     .store_slice(destination)     ;; serialize CurrencyCollection (see below)     .store_coins(amount)     .store_dict(extra_currencies)     .store_coins(0) ;; ihr_fee     .store_coins(fwd_value) ;; fwd_fee      .store_uint(cur_lt(), 64) ;; lt of transaction     .store_uint(now(), 32) ;; unixtime of transaction     .store_uint(0,  1) ;; no init-field flag (Maybe)     .store_uint(0,  1) ;; inplace message body flag (Either)     .store_slice(msg_body)   .end_cell();

left: I seem to understand. Through the store_slice method, a message is sent, and then the message is received in the recv_internal() of the Contract A contract. (reply to 6048)

Nick: Exactly. (reply to 6049)

left: got it. thank u  bro, (reply to 6050)

User<5163977145>: Hello people, I have a question regarding malicious bots. In a while I will work with a team that requires an airdrop bot, I see that almost all airdrop bots have anti-bot systems, but I don't fully understand the situation because the telegram API specifies that bots cannot read messages from other bots. So malicious bots are not telegram bots?  The question I am most interested in answering is the following: If those aren't telegram bots, are they using real phone numbers to create bots that look like humans?

left: 1. The document shows that get_data() represents the return of the persistent contract storage unit. What is this cell specifically? 2. Does load_msg_addr() return the address of slice ds? Why is it executed twice here?

doni: ton.app (reply to 6052)

I: How to store empty dict when deploy smart contract using toncli?

doni: get_data()  is a getter that you can call offchain ( using tonweb for example )   load msg address is a function that reads 267 bits into slice ( which is an address )  the structure of the contract storage is   coins , address , address , ref to cell   thats why the contract have this structure ( i think your example is jetton code , which is   balance , owner, master-jetton , jetton data cell) (reply to 6076)

left: ye.  jetton-wallet.fc. (reply to 6079)

Slava: That is a different type of bots, they are called user-bots. And yes, they use real Telegram accounts. (reply to 6071)

White: How much ton coin I need to make node?

TON technical overview: Generally correct, just a couple of little corrections: Usually get_data() is not a get method, but alias for c4 PUSH (push contract storage on stack) declared in stdlib.fc. You can make get method wrapper for get_data(), but usually methods for retrieving data about account, for instance getAddressInformation already contain contract storage field. load_msg_address does a little bit more than just reads 267 bits: it reads MsgAddress structure which in most cases indeed is presented by 267 bits (2 bit tag, 1 bit anycast, 8 bit workchain, 256 bit address part), but sometimes may be presented by other constructors like addr_none (2 zero bits), addr_var, addr_extern etc, see here. So load_msg_address  automatically detects what the address type it sees and read exactly that. (reply to 6079)

User<1735706531>: The Ton blockchain should have a large network project that would attract tens of millions (minimum, maximum - hundreds of millions) of users who previously had no experience with cryptocurrency. Currently, there is no such project. This is a fact. I have developed a new generation social network project using blockchain. This social network will be different from modern ones. Social network + marketplace + gaming space + augmented reality (and virtual) technologies. The network can be created in six months with the first initial level of opportunities for users. The following feature additions will follow. The network will have its own token in the Ton network to attract investors to the project. The network will have the opportunity to invest tokens in different projects. Currently, a team is being recruited (initial) + receiving investment at the pre seed level. I am waiting for suggestions from interested parties.

Maks: I'm also thinking of a large network project - a blockchain-based calculator.

Andrey: In this guide fift file generates external message with initialization of smart contract, then cell tree is dumps into boc wich is sending via liteclient to blockchain. (reply to 6202)

User<5318520448>: Yeah, this is what I saw all about external message initialization

Andrey: So maybe I miss-understand question? (reply to 6199)

Andrey: What are you trying to do? Internal messages are created by smartcontract to smartcontract (reply to 6199)

TON technical overview: The question is about what to do with generated boc's, if I understand correctly. Those files should be sent to LiteServer, than LS will spread them across the network, external messages will reach validators, will be included into the blocks and initiate transactions.

User<5318520448>: I'm trying to understand how to execute internal messages between each smart contract, but it seems different from external messages.

ehsan: The biggest problem rn is non-existent docs specially in English üòê  It makes building on TON hard for people all around the globe  Therefore most products are developed by few developers which could be prone to bugs  Not much developement activity.  Mostly marketing on Tg channels (reply to 6355)

ehsan: TON is pretty centralized imho.   Not gonna progress much unless it expands globally

User<5433135121>: Hi, why you think so? Did you analyze devs results? https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/commits/master (reply to 6362)

Andrey: Our open-source community already has quite a lot of developers and, moreover, repositories. I‚Äôll give you a small list:  https://github.com/newton-blockchain ‚Äî Core GitHub, where the open-source community started working on core components.  https://github.com/ton-blockchain ‚Äî The original TON GitHub of Telegram‚Äôs team, which was transferred to the community in an answer to an open letter. The project is in the process of migrating to this GitHub. So, part of the repositories has already been moved.  https://github.com/igroman787/mytonctrl ‚Äî Software for validators.  https://github.com/toncenter ‚Äî Web wallets and the corresponding software.  https://github.com/tontechio/ ‚Äî Software for miners.  And many others.  Open-source projects almost always comprise more than a single repository, which speaks for itself. This is the work of a lot of people where every single person does something fascinating for the project.  The NewTON blockchain contains the operational version of TON‚Äôs node. When we encounter a potential bug, vulnerability, or the opportunity to add something, we do it ‚Äî which can be seen in the history of the commits.  What did your colleagues want to see in code from launched and operational node software? The node‚Äôs code is really stable and safe; we don‚Äôt need to fix errors and bugs every single day or rewrite the code from scratch.  The development of new apps and components for the network is ongoing in separate branches, which are often private. This is also a totally regular practice. Usually, a tested and safe product, more or less, is launched in public. (reply to 6362)

ehsan: When is the DEX coming out finally? (reply to 6366)

Dario: soon‚Ñ¢ (reply to 6367)

Purple: dex.biton.app - testnet dex (reply to 6367)

Andrey: PancakeSwap, Uniswap, 1inch, Dodo and many p2p exchanges not enough? (reply to 6367)

ehsan: I meant on TON network (reply to 6370)

ehsan: I understand that TON is at the beginning so we should be patient

Andrey: the third-party teams that are not related to the ton foundation are engaged in the development of dex. TON Foundation specializes in the development of the blockchain platform, and projects on the blockchain are already being done by end users

Andrey: checkout this (reply to 6369)

ehsan: hope to see it on mainnet soon üëçüèª (reply to 6375)

altoshi: KuCoin and Huobi invested a lot of money in TON few months ago, so I think they will list Toncoin on their exchanges soon (reply to 6357)

F: It should be clarified that their venture divisions have not invested in TON, but in other projects based on TON. Without this clarification, third-party readers may be led to incorrect thoughts.  And also the discussion of this topic goes beyond the scope of this chat and is offtopic. (reply to 6377)

left: @slavafomin

doni: usually when you want to interact with a contract using a webpage for example   the webpage it self should connect to a wallet app / chrome extention  after the wallet is connected, the page has the wallet address , and it can use it for querying data about that wallet for example   show user ton balance , users nfts or user jettons ‚Ä¶  in case we want the user to send a signed transaction to our contract , we use the create a transaction object and pass it to the wallet app ( the secretkey is handled by the wallet app in all cases and its never exposed to the web page )  popular wallet apps ton chrome extension  tonhub ( mobile wallet )

TON technical overview: Oh, sorry,my bad, exit code 34 (you got in error) is subwallet_id mismatch: you can find it in code you sent by looking for throw_unless(34

Dario: You must call the "get" get_seqno method before sending any transaction (reply to 6454)

left: This is the address generated when the front-end creates the wallet. I don't understand what this has to do with the address of the smart contract, is it a mapping of the address of the smart contract?

TON technical overview: Looks like indeed subwallet_id = 0, however the code of this wallet does not coincide with any used in tonweb, do you use your own wallet code? That is why getWalletInformation can not recognize wallet and extract subwallet_id. Why there is a problem with matching subwallet_id in storage and in message not that obvious, perhaps you need to check wallet code which you are using. (reply to 6480)

Alex: Hi everyone! I have been trying to understand how Fift interpreter and compiler work since yesterday.  I don't understand how active words work.  Doc says "New active words are defined similarly to new ordinary words, but using ‚Äú::‚Äù  instead of ‚Äú:‚Äù. For instance, { bl word 1 ‚Äô type } :: say"  1 2 say hello + .  will print ‚Äúhello3 ok‚Äù, while  Could anyone tell me how it works step by step?  I understand it like the folllowing: Interpreter push 1 2 to the stack, after that it finds "say" word, it's active and state = 0, then it executes immediately -> "1" Object{0x60000324dcc0}. The stack stores 1 2 "1" Object{0x60000324dcc0}. Next "hello" and I expect that it throws an exception, but it doesn't happen, it adds 1 to 2 instead. And before Addition it adds "hello" and removes "1".  How does it work? Help me please

Chathusha: Hey! I'm created a jetton with jetton.live tool and it is showing on the tonscan. https://tonscan.org/jetton/EQCFsEh9N_S4WgSbw4t7Qmw4Qh9ayaqvvf_L2b3Lev-nhtVw But it's not showing the metadata. I found a jetton with metadata on tonscan. https://tonscan.org/jetton/EQBlU_tKISgpepeMFT9t3xTDeiVmo25dW_4vUOl6jId_BNIj How to add my metadata to database?

A: Hi quick question

A: What‚Äôs the requirements for a wallet to be ‚Äòactive‚Äô?

A: I noticed that upon creation wallets are not active

shahar: This is because metadata of jettons created by jetton.live is stored onchain and scanners expect it to be stored offchain. We will try and work with them to add onchain support, which is important.   Offchain data can be altered and then the name and ticker of the jetton can be compromised, which is why we decided not to support offchain. (reply to 6682)

Slava: The contract must be deployed first, and you should have some TON on the account for this. (reply to 6684)

A: So TON balance is required to activate a wallet? (reply to 6688)

A: Is there a minimum amount?

Slava: Yes. TON coins are used to pay for various fees, including the storage fee for your contract code and state in the Blockchain.

Slava: The longer you are planning to keep the contract active the more TON you will need.

Slava: Otherwise it will become frozen and you will need to redeploy it again.

Slava: However, in terms of monetary value, the fees are very small.

·Ö†: The wallet (smart contract) only becomes ‚Äúactive‚Äù when any tiny amount of coin are first sent Out. It can have a mega ton received and it‚Äôs not active. As soon as 1 gram is sent it‚Äôs active. (reply to 6689)

·Ö†: So if I make a wallet with insufficient funds for Fees x years later it‚Äôs frozen it‚Äôll unfreeze if it‚Äôs ‚Äúin credit‚Äù again? It that what redeploy means? (reply to 6693)

A: I‚Äôm not sure about exact numbers but after receiving 1 TON and sending 0.1 TON, I was able to activate wallet (reply to 6695)

talkol: Security precaution! Never use a Jetton where the token metadata is stored off-chain on somebody‚Äôs website.  Many Jettons make this security mistake, for example: https://kotecoin.com/kote.json  We must ask the makers of these Jettons to redeploy them with immutable metadata on-chain.  Why? Imagine that in a few months somebody hacks their website and changes this JSON and replaces the ticker of the coin. Your coin could lose value. Why add this unnecessary risk?  Jetton metadata should not be allowed to change. Please spread this around.

talkol: The fact that some scanners don‚Äôt yet support on-chain metadata shows you that the ecosystem needs help to mature. Please open issues with these scanners to show on-chain data and add a warning when the data is off-chain (since it may change without your consent) (reply to 6682)

Slava: That's not quite true. As I said, an account becomes active when the smart-contract is deployed to it.  Here's the example of the deployed wallet without any outgoing transfers and here's the code for it. The deployment fee was 0.004760001 TON for this contract. That is $0.003 currently. (reply to 6695)

Slava: The thing is that when you do the first transfer, the library would send the contract initialization data alongside with it, so the contract will be deployed and executed. However, you can deploy it separately as I've shown above.

Slava: Data of the frozen account is getting deleted from the Blockchain to preserve space. However, the hash of it is getting saved. In order to unfreeze the account you need to top-up the account first and then to deploy it again by using the same smart contract code and it's latest state (it should match the hash).

0xowB: hello does someone know why a TON address can be 'inactive'?

0xowB: I sent some TON over to an inactive TON address and it's not showing, which is weird.

Vasilii: To make the address "active" you need to send a transaction from it (reply to 6867)

0xowB: OK understand. otherwise it won't accept any tx over right?

0xowB: it seems it returned my sent amount over

0xowB: can i tell whether an account is active or not by any API?

Vasilii: If this is the address of the wallet, then he will accept all the subtleties that you sent him. If the address of the contract, then you need to already look at how it works. But if he sent you lice thin, then he is 100% "active"

0xowB: it's an inactive wallet and we sent some TON over, got refunded back us, this is supposed to work this way right?

Vasilii: No (reply to 6873)

0xowB: so here is what i got, but why did the tx got aborted in the first place?

RocketMan: Because account is inactive

RocketMan: Bounce flag returns all transactions to inactive address back

0xowB: ok understood. i will take a look at the api doc again.

RocketMan: Yes

0xowB: not setting a true or false parameter

RocketMan: Yes

–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Ä: Hello, guys. I'm new to TON and blockchain. Can you please, answer: is there a way to automate sending a TON from my wallet to others. I haven't found this in official documentation, maybe I just didn't read it properly. So, if yes. Can please send some links to documentation how to do this or examples.

left: There is not much readable material. But you can try to transfer money manually using the wallet plugin. This is very easy. (reply to 7087)

–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Ä: I found just now a TON Keeper wallet API - https://githubplus.com/tonkeeper/wallet-api. Is it also impossible to use it?

Nick: Is that a user facing application or a backend service? (reply to 7087)

–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Ä: It is a facing application

Nick: In this case I‚Äòd recommend to go with either TON Wallet or Tonhub.

Nick: This is just a specification but not a description of working API. (reply to 7089)

Nick: By the way, why did you provide a link to a shitty site but not to GiHub? (reply to 7089)

–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Ä: It was the first link that google sent me

talkol: This will be a general blockchain answer, not a specific TON answer. You can achieve this with blockchain in 3 different ways:  1. Have a client-side script (like a wallet) that will run on your computer and send the money. This script will have to have your wallet credentials. Not super secure but easy.  2. Have a bot on a server somewhere that will do the same. This is very dangerous because anyone hacking this server could steal the money that wasn‚Äôt sent yet. So very not secure.  3. Write a smart contract that will orchestrate this. Meaning you will transfer once all the funds, and the smart contract will allow the receiving party to send a transaction periodically to get what they are owed. This is secure but a little harder to write. But this is what blockchain was invented for. (reply to 7087)

talkol: If you want to fully automate 3, you can add a bot somewhere to wake the smart contract periodically. But unlike 2 this can be designed to be 100% secure so anyone hacking the bot server will not be able to touch your money

talkol: You can look at the smart contract as the only real secure piece of code that is enforcing the security of all other roles

–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Ä: Great, thank you!! Have you any implementation examples? It would be really useful

talkol: It really depends on your design and what exactly you need to achieve. If you just want to get a taste of what a very simple smart contract looks like, take a look at the starter project:  https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts  If you want to see a more relevant example to your use case, which is significantly more complicated, take a look at the official lockup contract:  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/lockup-wallet-contract  It‚Äôs a flavor of a wallet, that will lock its tokens and allow only restricted addresses to receive tokens and enforces a lockup period meaning how often they can receive. Not exactly what you need but many similarities.

talkol: If you just want to write a local bot (alternative 1), you don‚Äôt need any smart contracts - and just need to learn one of the JavaScript TON libraries that interact with wallets. Tell me if you need the links

–∞—Ä—Ç—É—Ä: Like "tonweb"?

talkol: https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/

User<5533541485>: Thanks! (reply to 7115)

talkol: Numbers in TON are tricky, because the numbers supported need to be much bigger than what JS supports. Also the accuracy is very high - there are 9 decimal points. So a value like 5.000001234 is actually encoded like 5000001234 (give or take a zero). The class BN is used to bring this support to JS.  There are convenience functions like these https://github.com/tonwhales/ton/blob/master/src/utils/convert.ts  That take care of all this for you. Function toNano will take JS number 5.000001234 and return BN object (5000001234) and the other function will take you the opposite way

C++ is more technical & has more gotchas to learn but there is a big user-base so i'm sure you can find help communities for C++ (and there's no space between the +'s). i hear that basic Python is relatively easy to learn and the popularity seems to be growing. so it's worth considering. but personally i don't like Python for it's weaknesses and i think it has some stupid crazy weaknesses.

Daniel: Anyone tried to execute compiled for Everscale code on TON?

Nick: @cryshado (reply to 7274)

Nick: (successfully) (reply to 7275)

talkol: TON doesn't support Solidity like everscale does so the foundation does not recommend to try to build Solidity contracts with everscale compilers. Contracts for ton should be written in FunC. (reply to 7275)

talkol: We've done a round of improvements according to feedback for the free open source Jetton deployer:  https://jetton.live  You can now inspect existing deployed tokens and see security advice about them. The tool now allows you to revoke admin ownership at any time to make the token immutable. And we improved the instructions to explain each field best practices. More feedback welcome!

Pablo: how can I get TON address with the chrome extension?? ton.xxxxxxxx??? Thanks

Daniel: I just compare complicity of Func and Solidity and Func is awful((( (reply to 7277)

Nick: TON supports any TVM compatible byte-code. It doesn‚Äôt matter what is used to generate this code. (reply to 7277)

talkol: Some of the architecture of TON is very different than Ethereum so Solidity is not a good fit. For example, calls between contracts in TON are asynchronous (happen on different blocks as messages) and are not atomic like on EVM. The amount of hacks everscale did to make it work is crazy and it's pretty not secure so the foundation chose not to support this concept

Dario: This  Also writing func directly is not that hard, its quite simple in the end once you get used to it (reply to 7284)

Nick: It is ‚Äûnot secure‚Äú in the same manner as ‚Äûton‚Äú npm package? (reply to 7284)

talkol: what's not secure with ton npm?

talkol: it's a great package

Dario: Data are untrusted, its not a lite-client replacement (maybe he is referring to this)

Nick: Everscale‚Äòs Solidity is a great tool

talkol: Everscale Solidity is not secure because it ignores TON architecture by forcing EVM concepts. This approach will create vulnerabilities in your contracts. You should learn how TON works and design for it. You can't just take Ethereum code and expect it to "work". Most Ethereum contracts assume that calls between contracts are atomic and if you break this assumption they will be vulnerable to attacks. Also, TON doesn't support unbounded data structures like Ethereum so if you create a hash table that can grow indefinitely, your contract can be attacked. Your contract in this case needs to be sharded to multiple child contracts like Jetton (TON's "ERC20" works). It's really recommended to learn FunC and TON architecture.

Pablo: üôèü•∫ (reply to 7281)

Narek: They somehow managed to simulate synchronous behaviour of calls? (reply to 7284)

talkol: Yes, with crazy async await magic (reply to 7293)

Narek: Omg

Narek: But how üò≥

Nick: I‚Äôm not talking about using Ethereum code as is. I consider it as an alternative to a shitty func, taking account all TON features. (reply to 7291)

talkol: they added concepts like await for calls and when it compiles the compiler builds a state machine automatically with entry points for messages.. so the code just appears "synchronous" in the Solidity but in reality it's broken up on multiple funcions

Narek: FunC fits great with TON architecture and primitives, but it‚Äôs bit low-level. I think it will be much easier for new dev‚Äôs to jump-in after release of Tact (reply to 7297)

talkol: The problem is that most developers will not be like you. They will take Uniswap V2 code and try to release an AMM in 2 days (reply to 7297)

Daniel: What is Tact? (reply to 7299)

Narek: Wow, looks like it‚Äôs even more unpredictable behaviour (reply to 7298)

Narek: How they calculate how much value you should send with message?

davide: it possibile to develop ton contracts in vscode?

Narek: tact-lang.org (reply to 7301)

talkol: For the record, I think ton npm is great and I prefer it to tonweb. If you want to play with FunC and need a starter project with tests and everything set up (similar to what you do on Ethereum with hardhat), use this (it relies on ton npm btw): https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts/

talkol: definitely, it even has plugins for syntax (reply to 7304)

Narek: great stuff! (reply to 7306)

davide: can you suggest me some plugins (reply to 7307)

talkol: I use this: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonwhales.func-vscode but there's a more official one.. let me find it

Andrey: https://t.me/tonblockchain/134 (reply to 7309)

talkol: that's not for vscode

Andrey: That more better, than vscode

talkol: lol no way :) it's not implemented in Java for one, and doesn't require 8GB to run

Andrey: Intellij required 2 gb for run (reply to 7315)

talkol: I was kidding :) Intelij is a bloated mess

davide: thanks (reply to 7310)

Slava: BTW, why do you prefer ton over tonweb? (reply to 7306)

talkol: the api is more full, for example tonweb can only decode cells but not encode them

talkol: support for dictionaries, typescript support

Andrey: it can encode cells, typescript and dictionary (reply to 7320)

Andrey: Are you kidding?

talkol: it's not native Typescript, there are some types hacked on after the fact in comments https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/utils/Utils.js

Slava: I was actually "hacking" them üòÅ  The types are generated from the branch of tonweb that was completely rewritten in TypeScript with 100% backward compatibility, so it should be totally OK for consumers. (reply to 7324)

talkol: I can see that tonweb improved a lot

talkol: when I started with ton it was very much behind npm ton

talkol: there was no encoding cells for a long time :)

talkol: I still don't find tonweb support for encoding/decoding dictionaries in cells like https://github.com/tonwhales/ton/tree/master/src/boc/dict

Slava: Well, it's not in master. There's an experimental branch for this. (reply to 7329)

talkol: I see, nice! well when this branch the native typescript are all merged back to master, I'll consider switching :)

Slava: Here's the TS version of the library, if you are interested. It has several improvements and fixes, and is covered with tests (still WIP). If you would have any suggestions/ideas, please let me know.  (link updated)

talkol: looks nice!

‚Äî 2022-06-28 ‚Äî

talkol: another reason I'm using npm ton is because I love https://github.com/Naltox/ton-contract-executor and it depends on npm ton too

talkol: it will be very nice if somebody creates a tonweb version of it that maintains the tonweb api for tests

talkol: it's @Narek 's amazing project

Ruslan: Currently, node can be compiled for arm64, but RPi4 has extremely slow CPU compared to x86-64. So it‚Äôs a bad idea

talkol: I have a question - why do you invest time in learning Fift? From my experience so far, Fift always felt much too low level to deal with. Compilation of FunC goes through Fift but then directly to bytecode, so I don't need Fift there. And all the deployments and tests and interactions with the contracts are much easier for me in JavaScript.. It's like if I didn't know Fift ever existed it wouldn't hurt me one bit (reply to 6598)

Chak: Could you please put your question on stackeoverflow and put the answer there? We are trying to collect DB of FAQ and issues (reply to 7419)

Slava: Yeah, I feel your pain. I've fixed it in the next version of TonWeb. But I'm not sure how soon I will be able to merge it. I'm probably going to continue my work next month. (reply to 7425)

–Ø–∑–æ–Ω: If i get U write I'm not using toncenter. I use ton-http-api in docker as endpoint for tonweb. And mainnet config file from git (reply to 7443)

Slava: Are you sure that it's configured correctly? Try to use the public TonCenter just for comparison. (reply to 7447)

–Ø–∑–æ–Ω: I use this config as described in docs  https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json I tryed toncenter as http api, it worked but there are limits so I decided to do my own api

Slava: It is fine to use public TC in development, the limits should be fine and the infrastructure is simpler.

Slava: However, in production you should use your own instance of TC.

–Ø–∑–æ–Ω: thanks for answers.  one more while you'r active in chat. does ton-http-api sync chain or something? It eats space in my virt-mashine and does not stops (reply to 7450)

Slava: How much space does it eat? Are we talking about RAM or FS?

Dario: It does not, it connects to ton servers (reply to 7452)

Dario: Maybe the problem is the cache?

Slava: It's not syncing blocks by the way. It's only a proxy for lite servers.

–Ø–∑–æ–Ω: cache is disabled. after starting ton-http-api virtual mashine grows and increased in size about 10 GB. (reply to 7455)

Prince: Guys, can you help me with this üòÖ. I'm not able to understand it properly  In the In the Collection content URL, enter link to the collection metadata. This file must be hosted on your side. Later, if you need to, you can change this link in the smart contract.  In the Collection base URL, enter the common path to your NFT metadata in JSON format. For instance, if you enter http://yourcollection.com/nft/ then the first NFT metadata should be hosted at http://yourcollection.com/nft/0.json, the second at http://yourcollection.com/nft/1.json, etc. These files should be hosted on your side. You can change this path later on if you need to.

User<5347971476>: It seems for me to use its 'getData' or "createTransferBody" would allow getting balance of jetton or sending it but I just arrived to TON world a few days ago... any suggestion for me? :)

Slava: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/test-jetton.js

Slava: Try looking at these examples.

User<5347971476>: thx I'll take a look! (reply to 7551)

talkol: Deploying an NFT is tricky because you must use IPFS - never use your own domain to host the JSON because then the NFT is centralized and you can change its fields in the future (it can‚Äôt become valuable).  If you‚Äôre using IPFS there‚Äôs a whole issue with pinning. The JSON is off-chain and IPFS is like torrents, somebody needs to seed it. This is pinning.  I would recommend to deploy through the big NFT marketplaces like GetGems because they will pin the IPFS for you. This is not something you will probably do yourself and you don‚Äôt want the JSON to disappear.

Step: can we code in ton smart contract like declare winner(s) on specific time for example 00:00 gmt/utc ? is it possible? (reply to 7592)

Andrew: Yes. But it will require an off-chain oracle that will send a message to the contract at the right time. (reply to 7594)

Step: 1 contract address for each lottery unlimited ticket x number of winners(customizable during deploy)  buyers will send x number of ton(customizable during deploy)  to the contract address at 00:00 gmt/utc declare x number of winners randomly. total received ton equally distributed to x number of winners.    is it possible with ton smart contract?

Misha: Hello everyone!  I've been looking a lot but still couldn't find a doc or example of receiving TONs in telegram bot. I googled with site: in bots api and ton docs websites, but no result. The only official mention of this feature I could find is this tweet by ton_blockchain.  Can somebody help me with pointing out resources I can use?

Batt: Proof of work of miners is the best and most secure decentralized system,

talkol: The way something like that would work is that you need to open a personal TON wallet. Just choose any wallet app you like - TonKeeper/TonHub/etc and open. You will then have a TON address.  Now you need to write a bot that lets users send TON to this address.  One way to do that would be via showing the users a ton://transfer deep link and when the user click on this link, this will trigger their wallet to show up. (reply to 7641)

talkol: The deep link would include your wallet address and the amount

talkol: Before you start with a bot, you can just play with the deep link manually until it works.. so the bot here doesn‚Äôt do anything really special regarding TON.. it just displays a link

Misha: This is the only possible workflow that came to my mind, but I‚Äôm looking for a way to call smart contracts and sign off-chain transactions using user‚Äôs wallet in Telegram   For example, we have a bot that lets a user to open a payment channel between the user and the bot‚Äôs wallet by calling a smart contract. And after that user can use their key to sign off-chain transactions generated by this bot  I was looking for a way to implement this using tonweb inside a webPage from Bot API. But I couldn‚Äôt find any examples or clues in the docs on how to connect a wallet to webPage  I had an idea of generating a wallet and storing its keys in localStorage of the webPage, but it is too unreliable to work in a real life (reply to 7646)

talkol: Payment channels is very experimental and new.. are you sure it‚Äôs required for your first version?  Can‚Äôt you simplify and avoid payment channels and just have the user send regular transactions?  How many transactions are we talking about per user? Hundreds? Payment channels only make sense in these extreme scales

Misha: Ahaha, I wish I could avoid using them, but it‚Äôs required to use payment channels in TON‚Äôs hackathon in which I‚Äôm participating now üôÉ (reply to 7648)

talkol: Ahh.. well I haven‚Äôt played with payment channels yet since it‚Äôs just recently released.  I will give you one tip though.. for the user wallet, use the Chrome extension. This is the easiest wallet to show off chain signatures with

talkol: Off chain signatures with the mobile wallets is more complicated and I‚Äôm not actually sure is fully working

talkol: This would mean that in your use case, the bot wouldn‚Äôt run on Telegram mobile app, it will run on a desktop browser with telegram running in the browser

talkol: I think anything else, like a full mobile flow inside the Telegram mobile app would be too difficult to do during a short hackathon

talkol: Did you find any official payment channels example that works? Your best bet would be to tweak this example

talkol: If you have some example, send me the link and I‚Äôll help you think how to convert it to your use case

Misha: The only official example is https://github.com/toncenter/payment-channels-example/blob/main/index.js, but it has nothing to do with telegram üôÅ (reply to 7654)

Misha: Most likely I won't be able to make the full implementation, but I wanted to put ideal workflow in presentation. I think I'll just put some assumptions about APIs that do not exist yet (reply to 7653)

talkol: Let me read the example, one sec

talkol: Ok, the flow in the example uses a local wallet in JavaScript - meaning a wallet running on some NodeJs server where you can put the private key inside the code  This works for example for the bot side. Since the bot wallet is operated by some NodeJs server  The problem with the example is that this wallet type doesn‚Äôt work for users.. users will either use a mobile wallet app (TonKeeper/TonHub) or the Chrome Extension.  So my first question is do you want to try to make the example work in an actual user wallet, or just stick with the given wallet example?

Misha: I'm working on an MVP with wallets generated on server-side, but as a real-life implementation i'd like to invent a flow which would envovle an actual wallet (reply to 7660)

My balance after 2.163336853 So 2.214044861 -  2.163336853 = 0.050708... So the question, how this work and why i get less money?

Slava: Optional chaining should work on Webpack 5 out of the box, because it uses a more modern JS parser. Make sure your build pipeline is up to date. (reply to 7638)

talkol: Invent and actually implement it during the hackathon? Or just show a presentation of what it would look like? (reply to 7661)

Misha: just for a presentation (reply to 7664)

talkol: Ok, cool, the actual working code will be server side wallets. But the presentation will show flow with real wallets. That would work

Slava: It's probably because of the storage fee, that's getting deducted from the destination account when it receives the transaction. (reply to 7662)

talkol: Ok - this is what I would do:  In the actual demo - you have 2 ‚Äúserver-side‚Äù wallets.  One wallet runs on the NodeJs server of the bot, so the code on the server holds the private key.  Second wallet simulates the user wallet. It will run client-side in the JS code the user is running. We will put the simulation private key in the client code. This is obviously crap security but it‚Äôs just a simulation. In the presentation the client-side user wallet will be replaced with a real wallet (reply to 7665)

Misha: huh, looks like a good way to show the idea (reply to 7672)

Misha: thank you for your help!

Slava: Now you ought to add @talkol to your hackaton team üòÅ (reply to 7665)

talkol: Lol, I‚Äôll give free advice to all hackathon participants :)

talkol: And to implement this flow, you can start simple without a bot, I would add the bot part at the end  So I would start with a simple NodeJs Express project that shows a simple website. So you can develop easily in Chrome  The Express server is the bot, so its code can hold one private key.  And the page that it renders to the user holds JavaScript code, that is your user. So this client-side page with JavaScript will hold the second private key. (reply to 7673)

talkol: Once your entire demo works on this, to convert it to a Telegram bot is quite easy. Actually if you have 2 devs in your hackathon team, one could work on the Express project and make the payment channels work there.  And the other can start working parallel on converting the Express project to a Telegram bot. But this part is not related to TON at all.

talkol: If you really want to kick ass in the hackathon I recommend using glitch.com  It‚Äôs the best dev environment for hackathons, they also have a template for an Express project:  https://glitch.com/~hello-express  Glitch will remove all the headache of deploying to an actual server. So instead of just working locally, you can actually develop on a free server somewhere given by them. This will be useful when you connect to the Telegram app which doesn‚Äôt run locally

–í–ª–∞–¥: where i can get secret key?

Abhay: is paymet channel is openend by the smart contarct ?

Misha: no, its opened by one of the parties (reply to 7681)

Abhay: so this payment channel is  like a p2p or websockets ?

Abhay: so if this is websocket so it on the server , and this server is on web2 or web3

talkol: It‚Äôs like a websocket for payments/transfers.  You set it up once between 2 parties. During the setup there is an on-chain transaction by both parties to a smart contract that does the setup.  Then you do many many transfers between the parties on the channel. This is like messages sent on the websocket. This part is completely off-chain so it‚Äôs free from gas.  And at the end, you close the channel. Similar to terminating the websocket. This part is also on-chain because the smart contract must close the channel (and do the actual final balance settlement on-chain). (reply to 7683)

Abhay: thanks for claryfying, thats what i am asking that the payment channel is initialized with the help of smart contract also (reply to 7686)

talkol: Definitely

Abhay: so this smart contract created by the party or ton has there own default smart contract for basic payment channel (reply to 7687)

talkol: I didn‚Äôt check but I suppose you deploy your own smart contract (reply to 7689)

Stas: Hi how many signatures i can create in payment channel?

talkol: So both parties must agree on the smart contract code and it‚Äôs probably part of the tonweb library since the client library does the deployment for you on setup

talkol: TON usually works this way because it‚Äôs ultra sharded. This is how I would have implemented it

talkol: The client library deploys the smart contract on setup from a quick glance - here is the compiled byte code of this contract in the library:  https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/contract/payments/PaymentChannel.js#L41 (reply to 7689)

talkol: Another interesting thing to know is that the entire logic of payment channels is just in this smart contract and the client library. I don‚Äôt believe TON node core was changed to add any special support. This feature could have been added to TON by any third party

talkol: For the presentation part, this is what I would do:  The client-side user simulation should show a fake confirmation dialog in JS every time the user needs to sign something (sending a tx or signing off-chain message). This simulates the real wallet asking user for permission to use their private key.  Then I would make a screen capture video of the Telegram bot flow in Telegram mobile app.  Then edit the captured video, and replace the frames where the fake dialog is shown with real approval dialog frames from a mobile wallet like TonKeeper that I would record separately.  This would give a very good indication of what the real flow should feel like. (reply to 7674)

talkol: And one final tip for all hackathon participants, if I had to create a quick Telegram bot during a hackathon - I would definitely use glitch.com for that   This would give you free hassle free hosting for your bot and let you concentrate on the code, not the devops  https://support.glitch.com/t/host-telegram-bots-at-glitch/34865  Quick search found a tutorial, never tested it though

Please open an issue with them. It needs to be fixed soon since Jettons with metadata off-chain are less safe for users (reply to 7815)

talkol: Jettons are a very new feature in block explorers and wallets, we need to work collectively on their proper support

don Valerio: Ok, just will wait when they include this. Thanks, support Tonkeeper answer to me about this too (reply to 7816)

Eugene: Hey there. I'd like to start writing smartcontracts for TON. But I don't have any experience in func. Is it possible to do so in solidity ? Is there any compiler for that ?

Slava: Hey! No, you will have to learn funC and the details of TON implementation. It differs from EVM at some crucial points. (reply to 7820)

Slava: Also, read from here: https://t.me/tondev_eng/7274 (reply to 7820)

altoshi: You can use Everscale compilators for TVM (reply to 7820)

Slava: Which is highly discouraged. (reply to 7823)

Andrey: Some of the architecture of TON is very different than Ethereum so Solidity is not a good fit. For example, calls between contracts in TON are asynchronous (happen on different blocks as messages) and are not atomic like on EVM. The amount of hacks everscale did to make it work is crazy and it's pretty not secure so the foundation chose not to support this concept (forwarded from talkol)

Andrey: Everscale Solidity is not secure because it ignores TON architecture by forcing EVM concepts. This approach will create vulnerabilities in your contracts. You should learn how TON works and design for it. You can't just take Ethereum code and expect it to "work". Most Ethereum contracts assume that calls between contracts are atomic and if you break this assumption they will be vulnerable to attacks. Also, TON doesn't support unbounded data structures like Ethereum so if you create a hash table that can grow indefinitely, your contract can be attacked. Your contract in this case needs to be sharded to multiple child contracts like Jetton (TON's "ERC20" works). It's really recommended to learn FunC and TON architecture. (forwarded from talkol)

Andrey: @theyanot

Dario: The main problem is that func doesn't have major functionality of modern programming languages. Even unit testing is a pain (reply to 7829)

Dario: A solitidy-like language could be useful for smart contract developers that came from evm, but i agree that a 1to1 language is not good for the ecosystem

Andrey: currently being developed tact-lang.org as a high-level language (reply to 7831)

Dario: Yes i know it, its a good project (reply to 7833)

Andrey: https://t.me/tactlang/147 (reply to 7834)

altoshi: I knew it, but since you said that Everscale compilators are compatible with TON I recommend sometimes to use EverOs Compilators (reply to 7830)

Andrey: I said about TVM. Compatible with TVM != Compatible with TON (reply to 7838)

altoshi: oh oke, I am sorry (reply to 7839)

Pablo: Hi, somebody found this method?

talkol: Community Jetton deployer - new features  https://jetton.live  We implemented another round of feedback, thank you!  1. On-chain metadata was fixed to support TIP-64. You can easily fix existing tokens to the new format through the tool.  2. You can now mint more tokens through the tool after deployment.  3. You can now see your token balance and transfer Jettons to others directly through the tool.  Thanks for the feedback! (forwarded from talkol)

Andrew: on-chain metadata is great..... but there is almost no support for it anywhere (reply to 7844)

talkol: Jettons are just being added to wallets. Do you prefer they all get published in unsafe ways? Or you prefer to sort out the wallets?

Seitaro: This is the way how it will start adoption (reply to 7845)

talkol: We will add option to put metadata on IPFS if you want, but we recommend against it. It will haunt the purchasers for years over parsing on-chain that can be added in 50 lines of code to wallets

Andrew: No, everything is fine) I just haven't made support for on-chain metadata in the wallet I'm developing yet üòÖ (tonhold) (reply to 7846)

User<5347971476>: thx for reply! I'll mint my own jetton directly at the moment due to tight timeline :) It would be good to have testnet supports for new comming developers like me in near time!

TON technical overview: Is it? After restart in May we closely monitor both testnet and toncenter api and it looks like testnet works fine. (reply to 7866)

shahar: in June we had outages, and also the rate limit on testnet is problematic (we wouldn‚Äôt want to expose an api key in the client). by testnet are you referrring to tonwhales sandbox or toncenter testnet?

TON technical overview: Toncenter testnet (reply to 7870)

talkol: It's a little funny but the best practice in our opinion is not to use testnets at all during the development process. When we run our tests, we use ton-contract-executor to run them locally and see that everything works. And then to see it with our own eyes, we skip directly to testing on mainnet. The costs are so low, so deploying "test" contracts to mainnet will cost you a few cents. (reply to 7864)

talkol: If you look at other ecosystems like Ethereum, the concept of testnet disappeared almost completely. Most people only use local unit tests and then test versions on mainnet.

talkol: A token name or symbol is not unique. Meaning multiple people can deploy Jettons with the exact same name. The only unique factor is the address. So when someone tells you they have the "real" token, you should compare the address and see that it matches what you know to be the real address. This is not specific behavior to TON, every other blockchain ecosystem in the world works this way. (reply to 7861)

Seitaro: Well, I believe it is because it is very easy to run local testnet (ganache), not because unit tests are enough. We also have MyLocalTON setup, but it is not yet that handy and deeply integrated into testing frameworks. (reply to 7873)

talkol: I think testnets disappeared because they can't be maintained. Since smart contracts can interact and send messages to each other, for a proper E2E test you need the other projects deployed to testnet too. Consider your contract using somebody else's AMM contract to perform a swap.  This requires insane discipline. Every developer must maintain testnet versions of all important infrastructure contracts. This doesn't work. So the testnet versions became stale or non-existent, and then the whole point of the E2E test falls.  Testing with something like ton-contract-executor is powerful enough for pretty much anything. It can easily be imporoved to bring datacells from mainnet to let you run integration tests locally in a "local" fork.  And when you're finished with that, it's much simpler to deploy a staging version of your contract to mainnet to see a proper E2E test in the real world. With gas so low, there's really no reason to waste time on testnet. (reply to 7875)

Andrey: We run own network with ton--k8s for testing of deploying 60k+ smart contracts and other staff.   If someone wants to, they can just reproduce our experience with docker-compose images there. It's pretty simple to run own TON network

talkol: Ganache implementation is actually more similar to ton-contract-executor than to MyLocalTON. It relies on ethereumjs which is a JS implementation of just the EVM, it doesn't really implement the rest of the blockchain. In the same way, ton-contract-executor is just the TVM ported to WASM.

talkol: In my eyes, MyLocalTON is redundant and instead of improving it, we should focus our efforts on ton-contract-executor.

Andrey: I don't think ton-contract-executor will help in testing complex systems where more than 4 different smart contracts interact with each other. The C5 register is formatted inside the validator-engine and this is quite a big problem. (reply to 7878)

Andrey: After passing the unit tests, you still have to watch how it works on the network. (reply to 7880)

Seitaro: The problem which talkol talking about is mirroring existing contracts to your local testnet. It is indeed not that simple. Three years ago I spent something like few days to correctly deploy uniswap (! something covered with docs and tests as much as possible in ethereum) locally for tests interaction with it. So solutions, which can "hijack" deployed instances from mainnet are quite handy. (reply to 7877)

Slava: I believe testnet is a better fit for staging/QA environments, where you can interact with the product manually or give your users ability to test integration with your service.

Andrey: After we finish the indexer, we can simply solve this problem ;) (reply to 7882)

talkol: We are using ton-contract-executor for complex multi contract tests in tonswap: https://github.com/tonswap/tonswap-contracts/blob/master/test/amm-minter.spec.ts  ton-contract-executor just needs a little love and adding a thin layer for the multi contract environment around it, so this would be even easier for developers.  I don't remember what C5 does, let me look it up (reply to 7880)

talkol: Exactly, only the mainnet contracts will have the data you need for proper tests, like existing liquidity in the pairs for example. To mock all of this in testnet would take too much time. This is why focusing our infra efforts on this mirroring mainnet direction my best bet. As far as I understand ton this should be quite easy. Even easier than Ethereum. When the TVM reads the datacell, we can just mirror this via RPC to bring the datacell from mainnet (reply to 7882)

Andrey: It seems to me it will be possible to copy and all the necessary contracts / data from mainnet to ownnet at the time of CI/CD. I think it's pretty easy to put them in gen-zerostate.fif  I even like this idea. Perhaps in the future we will experiment with this :)

talkol: @Narek has a beautiful example of this working in his README:  "Here is an example of creating local copy of existing wallet smart contract from the network deployed at EQD4FPq-PRDieyQKkizFTRtSDyucUIqrj0v_zXJmqaDp6_0t address and getting it's seq:"  https://github.com/Naltox/ton-contract-executor/blob/main/README.md

Seitaro: Yeah, TVM locality here is a strong advantage. (reply to 7887)

talkol: the best way would be to do it like ganache/hardhat. Do it lazily during runtime and maintain a local cache during the test so you only access the RPC once per cell during the test (reply to 7889)

talkol: @rulon since ton-contract-executor is so important, maybe it should be moved to the core repos?

Andrey: I think I'm interested in tests in which 60k+ smart contracts are copied locally ü§î (reply to 7892)

talkol: Then use the lazy approach and do caching on disk between tests. It will be much simpler to implement and understand and get you the same result. (reply to 7894)

talkol: This can actually be added in "5 minutes" if you have the lazy approach working on RPC. You just replace the RPC endpoint with a simple proxy that caches the requests on disk. Much more modular and you get all the features you want for free with zero maintenance.

talkol: If you want to invest more than 5 minutes, then I think the best design would be to make ton-contract-executor a little more modular and create the local disk cache as part of it. With the ability to place all local disk cache  in a single file/directory and then input this file for each test. So you can have different staging environemnts in parallel.

talkol: I'm not an expert on ton-contract-executor, but from a quick read just now, C5 is the output actions. I think @Narek¬†is already handling it: https://github.com/Naltox/ton-contract-executor/blob/main/src/executor/executor.ts#L26 (reply to 7880)

User<5347971476>: or any recommendation for a wallet that supports testnet "and" jetton?

Andrey: NonCustodial, because you have access to your seed words (reply to 7964)

You will do a maximum of 50 manual tests to see everything is working. This will set you back in fees approx $1. The time you will waste on setting up testnet is worth more :) (reply to 7966)

A: Hi. how to convert wallet address to  base64url or the verse ?

Andrey: https://github.com/andreypfau/ton-kotlin/blob/f0f2e7e05bc46d48fcbf6cef75249eea46890c7a/ton-block/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/ton/block/AddrStd.kt#L108 (reply to 8096)

A: Thanks a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è (reply to 8097)

isoscele üíé: Guys in func when "throwing" inside a function means that the transaction is cancelled? for example if i send from main acc 10 ton but in smart contract i throw if amount sent less than 20, means that the transaction is rejected and I still have 10 tons on my main?

Oleg: If its internal - depends of address bounce flag, if address is bounceable, then amount minus gas will be returned to your wallet. But transaction will be recorded in blockchain anyway. (reply to 8099)

Oleg: If its external - then it depends on accept call in code. If it throw before accept, it will be not recorded in blockchain

Oleg: internal = contract to contract external = human to contract

Oleg: in case if you transferring some coins to contract from your wallet it will be internal. you -> wallet -> contract, so external, then internal

isoscele üíé: What's the practical utility of non bounceable messages (internal)?

Oleg: coins will stay on contract side, for example this is used on wallet deploy, when passing state init

Sammy: What are Best Practices to debug smart contract?  For example I deploy smartcontract to testnet, but something wrong and ton bounce back.   Code is huge, and i dont know where to start debugging.  Can I start local node and read logs, or stdout or something?

isoscele üíé: I advice you this! https://github.com/Naltox/ton-contract-executor (reply to 8106)

isoscele üíé: It allows you to query public smart contracts and execute stuff locally

talkol: Normally, unless you're writing a wallet contract - which is something that probably just the core team should be doing, you will not use external messages anywhere. Everything should be internal. (reply to 8103)

talkol: I see some people doing admin/upgrade patterns on external messages, but that's bad practice IMO. If you want to transfer ownership to a multisig wallet all that wouldn't work.

talkol: Long story short, forget that external messages exist as contract writer :)

isoscele üíé: isn't sometimes better to directly interact with the contract via external messages instead of doing two steps (external to smart contract A and from smart contract A to B)? Especially when no money or authentication involved. For example a smart contract that based on the incoming external messages activates some behaviour. Making this contract usable for more ppl could make the private key mechanism useless but i think there may be some use cases. (reply to 8109)

talkol: The best practice is to use ton-contract-executor. If you're familiar with Solidity, this is very similar to what hardhat does. It runs the TVM in Javascript so your tests are very fast and 100% free.  This project shows a working setup for this on a simple contract: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts  You can enable debug mode in ton-contract-executor and then you can add DEBUG prints from inside your FunC code, here is an example: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts/blob/main/contracts/main.fc#L57 (reply to 8106)

talkol: No. I can't think of a single use-case where that would make sense. Most meaningful interactions would cost gas so you must pass through a wallet contract to fund the gas. And then the wallet contract interacts with you through internal message. (reply to 8112)

talkol: Going another step through a contract is not a problem, it's a feature. It makes the system modular and separates the wallet authentication concern (single signer vs multi-sig for example) from the dapp concerns. If Ethereum had made a similar decision you would be able to see people using multi-sig wallets for defi apps there.. which is a big headache currently

Vali | QS: pb solved, I've only used the official doc instead of following the instructions from the git repo ton-defi-org/ton-binaries. Now, func, fift and lite-client are working. (reply to 8094)

Sammy: I was confused by some repositories like  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/func-contest1-tests/blob/master/tests/tests/tests-1.fc  and this üòÖ https://github.com/raiym/astonished/blob/master/smartcontract/test/lottery-test-suite.fif  But i found  https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts/blob/main/test/deposit.spec.ts  And it is js-spec-hardhat style, that great news, thanks üòåüòå (reply to 8113)

talkol: These are similar to writing your tests in Solidity. I know that many people tried this years ago on Ethereum and everybody concluded it‚Äôs not a good idea and nobody does it today (reply to 8118)

talkol: I don‚Äôt think we need to reinvent the wheel here, there are established practices for effective smart contract development and those include writing tests in JavaScript. This is by far the most effective and efficient method

Sepehr: Can i accept TON coin as payment method in telegram bot api?

Narek: Hey guys!  We have open-sourced out smart contract stuff from @getgems  Hope this will help some of you to build your own NFT solutions on TON

Narek: Today we are happy to announce that we are open-sourcing our smart contracts along with tests and code for interacting with them!  This includes:   - test & code for interacting with standard NFT contracts - our own marketplace contract - our sale contract - our single NFT contract  Github link to contracts - https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts  Hope this will help developers to make more cool stuff with NFT‚Äôs in TON.  Stay tuned! (forwarded from TonTech)

isoscele üíé: You can use crypto bot api (reply to 8122)

isoscele üíé: In tonweb what is send mode?

talkol: FunC is a difficult sandboxed language due to security concerns of managing money on-chain. Much like Solidity. I would only use it to write the code that runs on-chain (the contract itself). Peripherals like a test suite can run anywhere, why would I use the most difficult secure language to write them? JavaScript is by far the easiest most popular language in the world, it‚Äôs a natural choice for anything that doesn‚Äôt run on-chain.  And regarding Fift, I think you can safely ignore its existence altogether. I haven‚Äôt seen one relevant use-case so far that justifies the time it takes to learn it. You simply don‚Äôt need it for anything.  The straightforward stack is very simple:  On-chain code - FunC  Everything else (test suites, build and deploy scripts, client apps, telegram bots, backends) - TypeScript (reply to 8118)

Andrey: > You simply don‚Äôt need it for anything.  I don't thinks so. I could develop native blockchian indexer (in c++ ton sources) only because I've learned Fift before. In my opinion - fift is good for quick experiments and understanding the work of TON.  Toncli helps using fift for interacting with blockchain for parsing and fast MVP developing.  > The straightforward stack is very simple:  Don't think so. Using tonlibjson you can interact with TVM / TON stuff in any language. So actually you can use any language you want. (Go, Python, Etc.)  Also tests can be written on Func itself https://github.com/disintar/toncli/blob/master/docs/advanced/func_tests_new.md it's very simple with new version of toncli & new tests engine. (reply to 8128)

Andrey: Would we be able to run @disintar faster without fift & toncli and using typescript?   Maybe.  Would it be just as fun, cool and educational?  Unlikely. (reply to 8129)

talkol: Will be cooler and more fun üòÇ (reply to 8130)

Andrey: ü§£ FunC

talkol: Of course you can use any language.. the question what is the most effective. There is soooo much to learn. We don‚Äôt need to overkill people with learning things that aren‚Äôt a must.  You want your teams to focus on learning 2 environments well and reuse this knowledge for multiple products. You will be able to ship faster in higher quality.  You‚Äôre not going to build your client in Python. And if you already know a good testing framework on JavaScript might as well reuse it for other parts.  I actually think it‚Äôs much more educational too. So people can focus on the important things and not on boilerplate :)

Andrey: In the current scenario, typescript is a very complex setup, the improvement of which will greatly slow down "growth".  Fift is much closer to the TON sources and allows you to experiment and introduce improvements faster.  The improvement of TON is much easier through the improvement of fift than through typescript, which has a very distant relationship to the TON sources.  Show me the contributing activity to the TON sources from your typescripters? If you look at the core TON repo improvement, you will see that these people are using fift.  So I would be careful with the choice of "important things" (reply to 8133)

talkol: I think if the core people would switch to improving infra like ton-contract-executor and improving the TypeScript stack, it would do much good to the ecosystem (reply to 8134)

talkol: TypeScript is no longer a complex setup, you have starter projects already set up (reply to 8134)

Andrey: I don't think so. Fift is very close to the TON sources and allows you to understand them more accurately, as well as quickly make improvements.  Whereas ton-contract-executor is a very far thing from the sources, although it is really good. (reply to 8135)

talkol: Normally you don‚Äôt want your app developers working in the opcode/bytecode level. We have abstractions for a reason

talkol: But of course there is no right answer, it‚Äôs all a question of personal taste ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

talkol: Here is a relatively complex multi-contract AMM with client and contracts and bot, with the stack I believe in, without toncli and without fift: https://github.com/tonswap  When we finish improving ton-contract-executor and wrapping it like hardhat, unify the api between tonweb and ton npm, this will be so elegant you could eat off of it :) (reply to 8130)

Sammy: idk   just 2 tests counter smart contract  on js mocha spec  https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts/blob/main/test/counter.spec.ts  and counter test on func   https://github.com/ton-blockchain/func-contest1-tests/blob/master/tests/tests/tests-1.fc  any js, ruby, python, hardhat, truffle, anchor coder knows how read and write specs without reading documentation (reply to 8138)

Dario: why did you make a dex that support trades only for ton/token pairs? (reply to 8140)

talkol: Good question, it‚Äôs the correct first version IMO:  1. Jettons are sharded to multi contracts so Jetton to Jetton swaps create too many messages that become hard to reason about. I believe smart contracts need to be kept simple so people could review and understand them. TON coin is native so you can handle it without extra messages so it simplifies the flow.  2. Liquidity pairs for the benefit of the ecosystem should be encouraged to be paired with TON coin to increase demand for TON coin. It‚Äôs much better for us than people doing pairs with USDC for example.  3. Most popular pairs on Uniswap de-facto pair with ETH.  4. You can swap between any two tokens with multi hop. And there‚Äôs going to be less price impact if we concentrate liquidity in the main pairs with TON and always go through them. (reply to 8142)

talkol: It wasn‚Äôt done out of laziness :)

Dario: ahahah (reply to 8144)

Dario: understood, still native-token pairs feels like uniswap v1

talkol: The client will support swapping any two tokens, don‚Äôt worry. The pairs are an implementation detail of how we split liquidity internally

Dario: + jetton-to-jetton are pretty easy to do

talkol: Yea, TON blockchain is very different from Ethereum that runs everything atomically. Less messages is better IMO (reply to 8146)

Dario: i have a different opinion, 9 messages is not such a big number

talkol: Hard to understand

talkol: Less chance for security vulnerabilities

Dario: even if there are more messages the logic is still the same

Vali | QS: If I understand well, 9 messages means that the swap would take at least 9 different blocks ? (reply to 8150)

talkol: Yes

Dario: no (reply to 8154)

talkol: And you need to explore 9 different pages in a block explorer to understand what happened

talkol: Messages are asynchronous, you can‚Äôt assume they will be handled in the same block (reply to 8156)

Dario: but i cant assume it will be handled in different block, too (reply to 8158)

talkol: Your code should assume that to avoid vulnerabilities, that‚Äôs what I meant (reply to 8159)

Dario: yes it make sense, really

Dario: im also totally for the kiss logic

isoscele üíé: What's the easiest way to run a lite client and retrieving basic info from blockchain?

isoscele üíé: Some great library or smth

Dario: If you deploy a "dex" contract manually for each pair with an init method, it could be reduced. If you make something like uniswap and so on, you need more transactions (reply to 8172)

doni: contract per pool is probably a must

Dario: No, i mean (reply to 8180)

Oleg: https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go if you like golang (reply to 8178)

isoscele üíé: Thx for direction! Is there something on node or python? (reply to 8182)

Oleg: Yes, tonweb for example, on js

Oleg: But i think it uses api to interact with ton

isoscele üíé: yes it uses https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC :( (reply to 8185)

talkol: Haven‚Äôt used any of them but maybe:  https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api  https://github.com/toncenter/pytonlib (reply to 8186)

talkol: Maybe these will be helpful too:  https://github.com/ton-foundation/ton-api-v4  https://github.com/ton-foundation/ton-lite-client (reply to 8187)

doni: In our current dex implementation (tonswap ) ton-jetton pools  swap is about 4 messages ( both directions)  add liquidity is 5 messages  remove liquidity is 5 messages   in case of multi-hop , swapping 2 pools together would be 4+4 messages , but max route would be always max 2 pools   i think the biggest challenge in jetton-jetton pools is add liquidity   it would be interesting to see how to it done securely

Andrew: Add liquidity to jetton-jetton is easy (without hashmap) (reply to 8189)

doni: you have sources you can share ?

Andrew: I can't post links to everscale dev chats here üòÑ (reply to 8191)

doni: üòÇ

doni: is it func code ?

talkol: Everscale code is assume is their weird solidity thing? Or is it FunC?

Dario: It uses the same logic as func (reply to 8195)

Dario: The only weird thing they added is await

talkol: Well, with await everything is easy üôÉ

Dario: What is your concern about the lp stuff? (reply to 8189)

Andrew: I can't post the solution (we're closed source), but it's really not hard. You just need to use the right approach (it's TON) Yes, on FunC (reply to 8194)

Dario: Also, its the same logic behind the token standard, you only need another contract for each user (reply to 8200)

doni: i think using jetton transfer + forward ton , is a good way to pass add liquidity message .  i think short path ( 5 messages ) , is easier to revert and has a better chance of success , adding an extra param for slippage to insure price changes in the pool , the longer the message count is the more room for price change (reply to 8199)

Dario: The problem is the hardencoded value for gas usage by the contract

Dario: Thats why a dex shouldn't use native ton, since gas price could change

Dario: You should read network config and use that to compute a dynamic value for the gas usage

doni: i think that separating the ton balance and the ton reserves can be separated easily

Andrew: need to hardencode the value of gas, not the value of TON required to pay for gas (reply to 8203)

Dario: I dont think its worth it, just use jetton -to-jetton and the awesome WTON token (reply to 8206)

isoscele üíé: Pytonlib gives me this error on client.init(). Is it a common issue?

Ruslan: Hi, maybe you use old version? Try to pip3 install -U pytonlib (reply to 8209)

isoscele üíé: It works great on ubuntu but not on windows. I'm investigating more (reply to 8210)

Ruslan: One more problem could be in Windows PATH max length. This path seems long enough. Did you extended PATH max length when installing python (there was a checkbox in an installer)? (reply to 8211)

Sammy: maybe better use WSL

Ruslan: Or Docker with Ubuntu (reply to 8214)

isoscele üíé: I used wsl thx. Temporary solution tho (reply to 8214)

Ruslan: Btw, it would be good to get some tech details on this issue to solve the problem in the library (reply to 8216)

Narek: Hey guys!  Today we are happy to announce our second grant. This one is also all about NFT‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a new concept of tokens called Soulbound tokens.  In short soulbound NFT‚Äôs can only be owned by one person and could not be sold  or transferred.  We are looking for a person or a team which will deliver smart contracts for soulbound NFT‚Äôs on GitHub using our technical specification.  Grant sum is 1,000 TON.  Grant applicants are expected to send a short intro and a cover letter to apply for the grant through our @nfton_bot (please, use the ‚ÄúNeed help‚Äù button on it). We might approve one team (or separate individual) to work on this project.  Technical requirements:  https://telegra.ph/TON-SBT-Contract-Product--Technical-requirements-07-11 (forwarded from TonTech)

aupiff: but the laguage standard includes all of c--and bjarne stroustroup himself says good C programs are good c++ programs (reply to 8260)

User<5396674943>: I have questions about TON's Payment Channels. Is there a TON group that can answer questions about that for me? (Great job by the way! this feature is impressive!)

aupiff: also, is anyone using a format for wroting TON smart contracts other than this .fc format I see here? https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts/blob/main/packages/contracts/sources/nft-item.fc

aupiff: I saw there was a solidity to TVM compiler on github. What's the plan for a simple language for writing TON smart contracts?

RocketMan: new language is developing for it. it is called Tact (reply to 8269)

aupiff: and where is the .fc format documented? (reply to 8270)

aupiff: what do you call the .fc format? And TVM bytecode, is that documented somewhere? (sorry for googleable questions, just want to make sure I'm using the standard references)

aupiff: can I use tact already? even in prototype form?

RocketMan: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/wiki/July-2022-Update (reply to 8273)

aupiff: I see thank you, .fc is FunC. appreciate the help.

aupiff: @a_s_shepelev given the state of tact now, do you think trying to write these nft start contracts in tact is worthwhile? (reply to 8262)

Narek: I don‚Äôt think Tact is production ready now

aupiff: "Tact is a very new project. It is not fully designed yet and certainly not ready for use. We announce it early in order to collect the feedback and make it useful to developers incrementally."

aupiff: yeah just saw this

Slava: FYI: https://t.me/tactlang

talkol: Solidity to TVM is not a direction TON believes in, these were attempts to do shortcuts and force Ethereum state of mind but TON is too different for this to work well  Read this to understand why: https://society.ton.org/six-unique-aspects-of-ton-blockchain-that-will-surprise-solidity-developers  Regarding Tact, I wouldn‚Äôt wait.. FunC is not very difficult by itself. The difficult part is more to understand TON distributed architecture. FunC is production ready and all contracts today use it (reply to 8269)

aupiff: what's the best way to understand TON architecture? reading the whitepaper?

talkol: What‚Äôs your background? (reply to 8284)

talkol: You can try here for general questions how it works. If you have API specific questions, I remember that during the hackathon about it a while ago this group was active: https://t.me/tonsc_chat you can ask in English there (reply to 8266)

aupiff: have been solidity dev for a long time, was a c, python & haskell dev before that (reply to 8285)

aupiff: native english speaker, but I speak russian reasonably well if there are better docs in russian to consult

talkol: So without a doubt start with this: https://society.ton.org/six-unique-aspects-of-ton-blockchain-that-will-surprise-solidity-developers I can‚Äôt stretch this enough. And then to dive deeper about any specific  concept explained there, ton.org/docs is your friend and browsing lightly through the white papers too. And if you get lost ask here and we will help point out (reply to 8287)

aupiff: thanks, will start browsing. (reply to 8289)

aupiff: what's the biggest app running on TON currently?

talkol: The contract that sees the most action? (reply to 8291)

aupiff: the most complicated and featureful. i want to read the code of a sophisticated smart contract (reply to 8292)

talkol: I think that the system smart contracts are the most complicated - the ones dealing with elections for validators for example

talkol: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/smartcont

talkol: They were written by core team so hopefully they‚Äôre more secure/thought out than average

aupiff: So the fif stuff looks incredibly complicated. we're probably not going to see much in the way of app development until something like tact is finished, right?

talkol: No no. Ignore the Fift, you don‚Äôt need it. (reply to 8297)

aupiff: ok focus on funC. is there a good example of a func app?

talkol: Look at Fift as an intermediary low level language. You write in FunC which is pretty simple - it‚Äôs just like C. It doesn‚Äôt have any crazy stuff.  Then in your build, the scripts compile your FunC to Fift and immediately Fift to bytecode. So you don‚Äôt need to master Fift unless you‚Äôre working on your own compiler or something low level like that

talkol: In the folder I included there are many FunC examples. It‚Äôs the files with .fc extension.  Here are the examples of NFT and ‚ÄúERC20‚Äù parallel in FunC: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract  They are just FunC code, without all the build environment. If you want to see how this fits in with build and tests, I made a project with a very convenient environment: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts  If you come from Solidity it will feel natural as the build and tests are in TypeScript like hardhat does (reply to 8299)

talkol: I don‚Äôt speak any Russian so for my interest it‚Äôs better the materials are international :) (reply to 8288)

Dario: We are probably the only non-russian func developers here :) (reply to 8303)

isoscele üíé: In order to check if a wallet has a nft from a specific collection, should I ask to every nft of the collection for their owner address and compare it with wallet address or is there a faster way?

talkol: There are some API services that index this information for fast queries, for example https://tonapi.io/docs (reply to 8306)

isoscele üíé: Thank you! There's an access point called getNftItemsByOwnerAddress that may work well for me. Anyway the idea behind this is to save locally the owners of every collection periodically right? There's no other way, starting from an address to get its nft? (reply to 8307)

talkol: Yes, these services normally index every block on the chain to see who holds what. So they run on every block and find the deltas

talkol: There‚Äôs no way to get from the chain directly all the NFTs of an address

talkol: You can either ask all collection items periodically or index every transfer which is what they probably do in tonapi

aupiff: so if i wanted to get TON without any centralized services or kyc i'd buy some ton erc20 on uniswap and then bridge to the TON chain?

Sammy: Can I send zero TONs in internal_message?  Its okay?  I Just dont want use external_message for governance requests

talkol: yes, although if you're willing to use a credit card there are services that will sell you some like that (reply to 8312)

talkol: you're trying to avoid the gas payments? (reply to 8313)

Nick: Just accept a message but don't send any messages from recv_external. (reply to 8313)

Yashar: Thank you @talkol I just read your article comparing TON to EVM. It's a pity they never explain it clearly in the official documents. It cleared so much for me (reply to 8283)

Yashar: I can only think about how difficult implementing the roll backs would be

Yashar: And I suppose everyone should consider adding a "replyTo" sort of field in their contract methods

Yashar: Or is there a better way to get around it?

Yashar: Also, what does it mean to pay rent for the contract? I have recently created a wallet on TonHub. Does it mean they are putting a small amount of TON aside to fund the wallets? And also does it mean I will loose my tokens if I don't touch my wallet for a long time?

talkol: With a wallet contract, rent is very simple, since rent is paid in TON and your wallet is a contract that holds TON. So tiny amounts of TON are reduced from your balance. 0.1 TON should be enough to fund your wallet for a long time so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it (reply to 8329)

talkol: If you create a dapp that stores state, this dapp contract will need to pay rent so you make sure this contract is holding little TON in its balance

talkol: Normally we just make sure it has 0.1 TON and that‚Äôs enough for a long time assuming you don‚Äôt hold too much state

Yashar: By a long time do you mean 1+ year or 10+ years?  I am aware that the blockchain gas price can change but let's assume the current cost

talkol: You will never lose your TON wallet contract as long is has TON inside since there‚Äôs always enough for rent. For Jettons (ERC20 parallel), you don‚Äôt necesssrily have TON balance in the contract so there if the balance will reach zero you will ‚Äúlose‚Äù your tokens. In reality, the moment you send some TON there your balance will be recovered

talkol: I think it will be good practice to multiply the numbers on ton.org/docs and see, let‚Äôs check if the docs are clear enough (reply to 8333)

Yashar: Cr ‚Äî The total price of ‚Äúreading‚Äù cells (i.e., transforming cell refer-  ences into cell slices). Currently equal to 100 or 25 gas units per cell  depending on whether it is the first time a cell with this hash is being  ‚Äúread‚Äù during the current run of the VM or not.

Yashar: ‚Ä¢ Cw ‚Äî The total price of creating new Cells from Builder s. Currently  equal to 500 gas units per cell.  77

talkol: @doronavgy can you help with the math?

talkol: You need the rent price, not the execution price

talkol: Rent is paid even when your contract doesn‚Äôt receive any transactions

Yashar: Yeah I couldn't find it. There was no mention in the gas section. The word "rent" returned no results

talkol: Try the white papers

Dmitry: Is this storage fee or something else? (reply to 8340)

Yashar: TonHub showed me a balance of zero until Ton contest sent some 0.0001 to test if the wallet exists. Does it mean TonHub had already deployed my wallet? (reply to 8330)

Yashar: I think storage fee. And apparently it increases if your contract holds more and more data (reply to 8343)

talkol: No, your wallet contract that was not deployed received some TON in its balance. But it‚Äôs not usable until you deploy your contract. So the balance was ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù for the deployment. (reply to 8344)

talkol: Normally when you start using a wallet app, it will deploy your wallet contract automatically as soon as you make the first outgoing transaction

Yashar: Where is it waiting? In your article there was the issue of unbounded data. (reply to 8346)

talkol: You can‚Äôt have unbounded per one contract. Here your wallet contarct is one contact and the data is a few bytes (reply to 8349)

talkol: So it‚Äôs a fixed amount of storage per contract, it‚Äôs not related to the unbounded problem :)

talkol: You are correct that with ERC20, but then TON architecture made sure that each user‚Äôs ERC20 balance is in a different contract

talkol: So again, even with Jettons the amount of storage per contarct is fixed

talkol: Just like on Etheruem, TON maintains a map of TON balance per address. Your future contract has an address so the address is well known, but it‚Äôs not deployed yet. You can still have a non-zero balance in the map in this case. (reply to 8349)

talkol: So everybody sending you TON can calculate your wallet address regardless if it‚Äôs deployed or not

Yashar: Oh I see,, so the balance is not held inside the contract. It is something native that is tracked by the platform

talkol: Yes, for TON balance

Yashar: Can you also comment on this? (reply to 8328)

talkol: In the ERC20 case (Jettons), if you‚Äôre sending a Jetton to somebody that doesn‚Äôt have a Jetton wallet deployed (they never received any yet), then your act of sending will deploy their wallet

talkol: ü§Ø

talkol: I need to write a post about this, it‚Äôs an interesting topic

Yashar: Yes I get it now. Thanks a lot üòäüôè

talkol: You do roll backs but they‚Äôre not too crazy. I‚Äôm not familiar with any magic solution. It‚Äôs patterns that you learn once and apply in many places in the same way. We‚Äôre working on an AMM GitHub.com/TonSwap¬†you can see how the rollbacks look like there (reply to 8328)

Slava: Great article, by the way üëç  A small typo though: rafty DoS vulerabilities (reply to 8283)

talkol: Oh thanks! (reply to 8364)

Slava: I was talking about the last word :) (reply to 8366)

doni: taking an example from jetton-wallet code   int min_tons_for_storage() asm "10000000 PUSHINT"; ;; 0.01 TON  int gas_consumption() asm "10000000 PUSHINT"; ;; 0.01 TON   the cost of renting 1 cell is 0.01 Ton   the cost of the computation is also 0.01   so the contract has the responsibility of maintaining the storage fee plus the execution fee ,  its also a common practice to make sure the outgoing messages have enough ton to pay for the future execution   also each message has the cost of fwd fee , so each message has to pay fee a fwd fee per message (reply to 8338)

talkol: rent is calculated per block, for how long does 0.01 TON is enough?

talkol: how many blocks?

Lexx: Hello. Guys, how can i get all ntfCollections data in TON. TonWeb.token.nft.NftCollection need address, but i need all of them

isoscele üíé: And that was a good read. Thank you ü•∞

isoscele üíé: The asynchronous architecture doesn't allow us to instantly receive return of get functions of other contracts. So we have to wait a block for each consecutive async call because messages have travel time right? (reply to 8283)

talkol: Yes, messages are not synchronous. They‚Äôre like new transactions. They‚Äôre not processed within the flow of the current transaction. If we‚Äôre lucky they might be processed in the same block, but if we‚Äôre not lucky they‚Äôll only be processed in a future block.  Some flows, like the DEX flow @dariolol mentioned have as many as 9 messages. This will sometime take a few blocks (reply to 8382)

Dario: for now, everything has been alway processed in the same block (reply to 8384)

isoscele üíé: Shouldn't this be something scary? This way the architecture implicitly forces you to have monolithic smart contracts that do all the job and don't interact each other. Or couldn't this open up to redundant smart contracts get functions that calculate the information all over again instead of asking it to another smart contract cause in the long run may take more time? (reply to 8384)

talkol: I corrected my answer to sometime, very interesting! (reply to 8386)

talkol: But I assume some other peoples messages can fit between yours so developer should never make assumptions on atomicity

talkol: Monoliths can‚Äôt work, the architecture ‚Äúforces‚Äù you to shard. Because of the unbounded data structures part. So even simple ERC20 is actually many contracts. One contract parent. And one contract per holder to hold their balance.  I would say it‚Äôs a different way to think. It‚Äôs scary at first but you see it‚Äôs not that bad.  Instead of pulling information, it works by push. One of your contacts pushes the data to the next one.  @dariolol has a good experience with a pretty complex flow of Jetton to Jetton swap in a dex (reply to 8387)

doni: Right now there is only 1 shardchain , so we dont get cross shard messages ‚Ä¶ once the chain will be sharded we will start to get cases where the x messages spread over multiple shards (reply to 8386)

talkol: Good point! (reply to 8391)

Dario: true, but still this is an extreme case and even in that case the dex should work in a couple of block. 9 (actually 8 excluding the callback that carry excesses) messages are a good number for a dex swap (reply to 8391)

Dario: i mean, i like the logic "lowest possible messages is better" but we shouldnt be afraid of multiple messages, this is the only way to scale the contracts. even the transfer itself requires 5 transactions

talkol: Definitely

talkol: Anyone here who likes to write, please submit posts to society.ton.org  We need more dev community content in English  It‚Äôs very easy to submit, just write it in markdown on GitHub gist: https://gist.github.com/talkol/c65e583a184261453156af1924021580  And send to them by email (society@ton.org) or Telegram (https://t.me/tonsociety_chat)  It‚Äôs a good opportunity to get visibility for your dev team and share what you‚Äôre working on

Semion: Can anybody help with that? (reply to 8507)

talkol: 1.5 TON is usually much more than you need to deploy. What tool are you using for deployment? (reply to 8507)

Semion: tondev  I call "tondev contract deploy test.abi.json -s mykeys" (reply to 8514)

RocketMan: wrong blockchain :) (reply to 8515)

Semion: What's the right one?

RocketMan: tondev is everscale (ex free ton) tool, this chat is about ton blockchain (reply to 8517)

Semion: How to deploy in ton Blockchain? (reply to 8518)

talkol: There are 3 ways I‚Äôve seen around:  1. Write a script in TypeScript to deploy, that‚Äôs my favorite way, example: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts/tree/main/build  2. Use toncli command line tool: https://github.com/disintar/toncli  3. Write a Fift deployment script, but then you need to learn Fift üòÖ (reply to 8519)

altoshi: Is it too dangerous to use everscale compilators for TON?

talkol: Probably so, isn‚Äôt most of their dev done in Solidity-ish?

altoshi: Yes, Solidity and other popular languages (reply to 8523)

altoshi: But their ecosystem is doing well, probably we can use it , then audite the code. (reply to 8523)

RocketMan: > their ecosystem is doing well go there :)

talkol: In general, the EVM state of mind is very different from TON state of mind so we encourage learning the TON native way instead

Nick: No, but it'll require additional knowledge. Also this compiler supports few EVER-only instructions which should be avoided. (reply to 8522)

altoshi: Oke, what about EVM workchain in 2023? (reply to 8527)

talkol: It may exist but it won‚Äôt be scalable like native TON

talkol: There are inherent things preventing EVM from scaling

altoshi: Why not? EVM chains like Avalanche are still fast (reply to 8530)

talkol: Not really, they‚Äôre not sharded because all contracts assume all data is found on the same machine

altoshi: Avalanche is multichain :/ (reply to 8533)

talkol: Read this: https://society.ton.org/six-unique-aspects-of-ton-blockchain-that-will-surprise-solidity-developers  TON is different from every other L1 out there, to achieve its sharding the contract developer must implement sharded contracts (reply to 8534)

altoshi: Do you have some info about workchain communication? Will it work like Cosmos IBC and Polkadot XCMP? (reply to 8533)

talkol: With Everscale, we can do a security analysis and I bet that we can show a problem with their native ERC20. Is their ERC20 Solidity-ish implementation sharded on a new contract per balance? I bet they hold all balances in one contract like the Ethereum way. This means an attacker can write keys to the map continuously until some poor account is so deep in the tree that it can‚Äôt be updated anymore since gas for updates costs in proportion to the height of the cell tree

talkol: This could be a very nice answer as to why we don‚Äôt try to force EVM notions on TON

talkol: We should create a footstep for this üòÇ

Slava: This looks like a wonderful idea, not only such code will be easier to read, it will probably be more secure, because each library function will be reviewed by the experts and will stand the test of time.

Kaio_toxik: Hello. Does anyone know / can show an example of how to get the wallet address from the mnemonic?

talkol: Start with this library to get the public and private (secret) key from the mnemonic: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic (reply to 8546)

talkol: Then use this library to get the wallet address from the keys: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb

talkol: If you just want to read data, the public key is enough. If you want to write data (like send transaction) then you will need the secret key

Kaio_toxik: thank you very much.Ill try this (reply to 8549)

talkol: Notice that there is one nuance, the wallet address is derived from the public key + the code of the wallet

talkol: There are multiple wallet codes that people use (V2, V3, V4) so each of them would have a different address

talkol: Normally you see code trying all of them to see which one is deployed

Kaio_toxik: Maybe that's why I didn't get the right result. (reply to 8552)

Kaio_toxik: const keyPair = await tonMnemonic.mnemonicToKeyPair(mnemonic);     const nacl = TonWeb.utils.nacl; // use nacl library for key pairs     const tonweb = new TonWeb();            const walletm = tonweb.wallet.create({publicKey: keyPair.publicKey, wc: 0});             address = await walletm.getAddress(); (reply to 8552)

Kaio_toxik: this code returns incorrect address

Kaio_toxik: how to change the wallet code? (reply to 8552)

Kaio_toxik: i change wc: 0 to wc:3,  but it return  "if (wc !== 0 && wc !== -1) throw new Error('Invalid address wc ' + anyForm);"

talkol: First, let‚Äôs make sure it‚Äôs the incorrect address because there are several ways to encode the same address

Sergey: address.toString(true, true, true, false) (reply to 8556)

talkol: Put the address you got in a block explorer and see it leads to the correct wallet

talkol: Or put the address here https://ton.org/address/ to compare the public key hex, that‚Äôs unique

talkol: If you don‚Äôt have the correct address, then probably the wallet code is from a different version

Kaio_toxik: public keys are differentüòï (reply to 8562)

talkol: Open the real wallet address in TonWhales block explorer, it will show you the code. For example: https://tonwhales.com/explorer/address/Ef-KJp9REa0zDgaM6f3JW--e9gKDg1_udGBtzUVtTahmoY3t

talkol: You see on top it says ‚ÄúWallet V3 (r2)‚Äù

talkol: That‚Äôs the code the wallet is using

talkol: When you put your correct wallet address in the explorer, what wallet code do you see?

Kaio_toxik: V3 (r2) (reply to 8568)

talkol: What chain? Master chain or work chain?

Kaio_toxik: Basic Workchain (reply to 8570)

Kaio_toxik: and the address that returns with the           address = await walletm.getAddress();  shows Contract Type  unknown contract

Kaio_toxik: ü§Ø

talkol: Are you sure this is the correct mnemonic?

Kaio_toxik: 100%. thats my address (reply to 8574)

talkol: Ahh I see

talkol: It‚Äôs indeed not the default of TonWeb

talkol: The default for TonWeb is V3r1

talkol: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/contract/wallet/index.js#L32

talkol: Ok, let‚Äôs fix it

talkol: You need this guy: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/contract/wallet/index.js#L17

talkol: TonWeb API is super confusing. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Personally I‚Äôm using ton npm which has a slightly more friendly API

User<5556248309>: Hello there, is all ton blockchain development done in this repository?  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton

Andrey: https://society.ton.org/six-unique-aspects-of-ton-blockchain-that-will-surprise-solidity-developers (reply to 8622)

Andrey: firstly, development takes place not only in this repository. ton-blockchain/ton repository refers mainly only to software for validators. You can check the testnet branch, there is a more active history of comits. Also look at the other repositories of the ton-blockchain organization, there are also a lot of active comits (reply to 8624)

talkol: The blockchain is not developed in a single repo. We‚Äôre building an ecosystem, there are many different parts. For example Payment Channels and TON DNS are among the newest big features on TON and they‚Äôre not in this repo. (reply to 8624)

talkol: If you‚Äôre looking for big feature release activity, it would be better to judge according to feature announcements and not commits in the validator node repo: join this channel to see the feature announcement: https://t.me/toncoin

talkol: Just looking for big feature announcement from the last few days you can see TON DNS (the auction starts in 10 days) and TON Payments. Both of them huge features that I doubt Solana released anything of this magnitude in the last month.

talkol: TON is not just a blockchain, in the roadmap you will see elements like TON Storage that is comparable to IPFS and FileCoin, huge projects in their own right. TON DNS is in the magnitude of ENS. We‚Äôre just in the beginning here :) this is probably the most ambitious project around

‚Äî 2022-07-21 ‚Äî

Jin: Is there any way to store 'tuple'? In case of 'cell' I can use store_ref for storing. I can use 'nested cell' instead of tuple, but I prefer to use tuple itself

Yashar: With the DNS we still need to configure something on our browsers right? (reply to 8630)

Dmitry: Sure. I guess, we will need to install some browser extension or run some standalone software to proxy requests through, since we need ton dns name resolution and ton sites underlying protocols like adnl and rldp are not supported by browsers natively. (reply to 8644)

talkol: The idea behind the browser extension or proxy is to add more important behaviors to websites like privacy (both for visitors and publishers). TON DNS is just sugar on top.  In the future, I imagine TON foundation will also be able to purchase the IANA TLD .ton (it costs about a million dollars so not too bad), just like Amazon bought .amazon TLD and then you will not need an extension. I‚Äôm not aware of a current plan to do it, but if I were them this is what I would do. (reply to 8644)

isoscele üíé: Are there any monitorings of time between transaction boc send and transaction actually inserted in chain?

isoscele üíé: Or the mean time idk

talkol: Why would you need that? The network is significantly more scalable than current load, so every tx should enter a block within 1 block max 2 blocks which means 5-10 seconds (reply to 8649)

Dario: @rulon where is defined the 16kb limit for bocs?

isoscele üíé: I don't like odd numbers so I want my transaction to be in a good even blocks (reply to 8651)

Seitaro: Boc itself is not limited in size. Actually whole blockchain state is a cell (everything is a cell :) ). However size of the external message is limited by 64kb (previous time i made a mistake when said that limit is a 16kb). (reply to 8652)

Dario: okay but i cant find this limit in parameters (reply to 8654)

Dario: is this a limit implemented in lite servers?

Dario: or clients themselfs

Seitaro: On the node level: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/db3619ed310484fcfa4e3565be8e10458f9f2f5f/validator/impl/external-message.hpp#L40 (reply to 8656)

Dario: oh

Dario: okay, thanks

Dario: is it planned to move these limits in the network configuration? it would be nice to have a chain to store big data

Seitaro: Yeah, probably it is a good idea to move these params to network config. (reply to 8661)

Dario: also, the snake algo is not that efficient for storing data, maybe its better to move to another implementation that uses all the tree to store data

Andrey: Interesting to create chunk upload of big data into chain :))) (reply to 8661)

Seitaro: Oracle software is not open-sourced. (reply to 8670)

altoshi: will it open source? (reply to 8672)

talkol: If you're building a bridge Oracle, I believe you can find open source projects that implement this behavior and learn how they work. They will probably be EVM-EVM so you will have to translate one side to TON  For example Ronin is Axie Infinity's side chain which has an EVM-EVM bridge and is implemented mostly here and not too complicated: https://github.com/axieinfinity/ronin-smart-contracts  There is also this project: https://docs.tokenbridge.net/amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge  There should be literally dozens. All open source so you can review their implementation and understand the architecgture.

User<5111862779>: Ok, I will have a look. I notice some blockchains are supporting tokens as standard in-built assets while others represent them exclusively through smart contracts.

Andrew: TON also has support for built-in tokens, but it will be used for very important tokens (or will not be used at all) (reply to 8701)

talkol: The native tokens in TON require validator consensus for approval IMO so they‚Äôre not for users to spam their own like ERC20. Jettons on TON are just like ERC20, anyone can launch their own in seconds, see for example https://jetton.live, and can customize their behavior in code like ERC20. I hope we will see native tokens in TON used for the important future tokens like USDC/USDT.

User<5556248309>: Where can I report a bug about TON wallet Linux version? When I enter my key phrases it connects me to another wallet(tried few times) and not mine, I tried web wallet, tonkeeper and tonhub they're all working perfectly so I believe the problem is from Linux wallet.

Vasilii: It just opens another version of your wallet.   In the settings of the Tonkeeper, you can select the 3rd version (4 by default) and you will see the same address as on the Linux wallet.  Linux wallet has not been updated and does not support version 4  In short, your key phrase is several wallets at once (reply to 8720)

Mikhail: Tell me, please, is it possible to specify the fee payer when sending Jetton tokens?  those when sending tokens from one wallet to another wallet, the fee is paid by the third one.  how to do this through tonweb lib?

doni: the fee payer is all ways the sender,   the messages route in jetton transfer  wallet1 > jetton-wallet1 > jetton-wallet2 > wallet1  so wallet1 had to pay gas for all future messages   in case wallet1 paid too much gas the gas change will be sent back to wallet1 ( via the excess message)  this way you dont have to estimate the gas fee exactly. (reply to 8788)

Mikhail: Thanks! (reply to 8790)

Mikhail: Does TON plan to make this possible? For example, on the Solana network, you can do this. (reply to 8790)

doni: you can implement this method

doni: but you will have to make sure the contract pays gas only for transactions from known addresses

doni: otherwise it is a vurneabilty

Muxel: Hello, I made a library to work with Crypto Bot in python, check it plz https://github.com/sllavon/crypto-pay-api-sdk https://pypi.org/project/crypto-pay-api-sdk

doni: the architecture is similar to a wallet with multiple owners

talkol: If you just want to choose a name and description there‚Äôs a convenient web UI in jetton.live so you don‚Äôt need to deal with code. If you want to change the logic then the GitHub repo has a project ready for deployment. Please read the README in the repo I linked above, it has very very thorough documentation

Daniil: By customisation I meant changing the logic (reply to 8888)

talkol: If you want logic like to add a separate fee during transfers then yes, the changes will be in these files

Daniil: Okay.  And by the way, if I don't need the minter contract, I can use only the jetton-wallet right? (reply to 8888)

altoshi: Why do you promote this service too much (reply to 8885)

talkol: No you need both (reply to 8893)

Daniil: Or does wallet somehow depends on jetton-minter? (reply to 8893)

talkol: Minter is the parent and wallet is the child. There is one minter instance and N wallet instances (N is the number of holders of your token) (reply to 8897)

Daniil: I thought minter contract is for the dev of the token to mint more of them?

talkol: I promote it because it‚Äôs safe and follows important security practices that most people don‚Äôt know how to do themselves. This project is free and has no business model (reply to 8895)

talkol: If you don‚Äôt want rug pools in the community you need to educate what is expected of new projects, like revoking admin before launch

talkol: If you try the UI it will show you the security advisories regarding any Jetton that anyone launched

talkol: The parent is indeed what you mint through but even if you close the mint functionality you still need the minter instance, it points to the metadata of the token and routes to the children (reply to 8899)

Daniil: 1) that's how I'm loading it in smart contract 2) that's how am I passing it to external message (reply to 9056)

Daniil: getting dest_addr from cmd

Daniil: () recv_external (slice in_msg) impure {     var valid_until = in_msg~load_uint(32);      throw_if(35, valid_until <= now());      var dest_addr = in_msg~load_bits(256);      var msg = begin_cell()         .store_uint(0x18, 6)         .store_slice(dest_addr)         .store_coins(1)         .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)     .end_cell();      accept_message();      send_raw_message(msg, 3); }  I think that's better than screenshots

isoscele üíé: Store coins is in nano ton? (reply to 9055)

Seitaro: Yeah, both snippets are not correct : 1) you should read address from slice via load_msg_addr 2) store address to builder via Addr, not addr, (fift is a little crazy, yeah) (reply to 9058)

Daniil: Thanks! It works now.  What's the difference between addr, and Addr, by the way? (reply to 9062)

Seitaro: addr, is alias for 256 u,: write 256uint. Meanwhile full address serialization also include address format tag, workchain, 256bit part ans some additional fields. Addr, consume from stack two elements: workchain and hash-part and handle this (reply to 9063)

Amir: Hi... I wanted to write smart contracts on TON... and TON has FunC for it"s smart contracts... Is there any way to write contracts with solidity on TON?

Yashar: No! FunC and how TON works is fundamentally different from Solidity or other conventional virtual machines. You have to learn it directly. And bear in mind the assumptions we have in Solidity do not apply in FunC. (reply to 9067)

Amir: Thanks... And what are the best sources for funC? (reply to 9069)

Anthony: https://ton.org/docs/#/func/overview (reply to 9070)

altoshi: It could apply, if you make solidity messages asynchronous (reply to 9069)

Amir: And where can I learn this method? (reply to 9072)

altoshi: You can try Free TON compilators for TVM and see the difference between Asynchronous Solidity and Synchronous one (reply to 9073)

Yashar: To my understanding, in TVM you can not make a function call to another contract and wait for its response. If your contract requires communication with other contracts, it means they have to support a form of callback and in your contract you have to consider that by the time the response arrives, some environment variables might have changed. So the code you write will look completely different. Am I wrong? I have not written FunC I have only read about it and had a conversation about it with @talkol . (reply to 9072)

Be the Future of Web3: same question for TON

Ivan: Hello everyone, I wish to participate in the current TON contest and I am trying to install FunC. I am absolutely new in this field. I'm following this manual https://github.com/disintar/toncli/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md but at step 10, I keep getting error Command '['path_to_func.exe', '-V']' returned non-zero exit status 3222601730' (I am running console as admin). I found this command in the Toncli python script, it just tries to run func.exe. So it sees func.exe but cannot run it. When I try to run func.exe manually, it gives error "couldn't start the program correctly", so apparently it's some system problem. My laptop has Windows 11. Somebody knows how to fix this?

Pablo: Good afternoon. Who understands TON smart contracts, please advise on the estimate and timing. 5 minutes help needed. Does anyone have experience in development. I need to know the order of numbers (1000/10 000) and the time +/- month  1.Token on TON block-chain 2.Android app. tokenomik integration, mining tokens from smart contract for specific interractions. 3.NFT smart contract + integration with android app to interract.

Pablo: No one can know exactly spend, but i need nubers to build budget. Help please

Daniil: I don't understand your question for the 2 days already (reply to 9253)

Pablo: As i say you in russian chat. I build money budget for our project and need share of experience:  How much development cost and how much time different stages take. Not exactly but in accuracy of +/-1000$ (reply to 9254)

Slava: It's around $100500 and 133.7 hours on average.

Pablo: Am i join TrollDev.chan? Sorry (reply to 9257)

Andrey: I'm afraid there is no answer to the question. The number of developers is limited, and the demand is very high. I recommend finding specific people in hackathons and talk to them personally (reply to 9256)

Mark: You question is so vague How can you expect any specific answer? (reply to 9256)

Pablo: I expect answer like:  I or my team can  Simple create token for 500/1500$ in like 1/2month build smart contract on TON for 5000/15000$ in like 2/10month Integrate token in android app for 10000/20000$ in like 3/5month NFT for 5000/7000$ in like 2/3month (reply to 9261)

Mark: Honestly Pablo To create a Jetton on TON is a childish task "Build smart contract" is very vauge statement of work, the answer is like from 0 to ‚àû You can expect the specific answer only if you provide the specific technical requirements. Apart from this the answer is from 0 to ‚àû. Do you need a proof of concept or a product ready? Nobody knows what is the product you going to build about. The cost in terms of money and time varies in degree(!) depends on details.

Mark: And to estimate is not just a 5 minute time help. Seriously? Are you going to put you project at risk relying on the answers of some strangers in some chat?

Pablo: I just try to analyze costs of different tasks on development market (reply to 9264)

Mark: I'm nobody to advise you, but don't rely on some strangers. They don't care. You can get reliable analysis only from somebody concerned in the future of your project (probably yourself).

talkol: The requirements are very vague. How are tokens in (2) mined? Current Jetton implementation does have a minter role but it‚Äôs centralized so would normally be revoked. Are you planning to keep a centralized backend that mines tokens for whoever asks and the Android app asks it to mine? I assume you don‚Äôt put the minting credentials in the Android app itself since it runs client side (reply to 9253)

Pablo: Your are the one who work with such cases in the past. You have some experiance instead of me (reply to 9267)

Mark: Really?  You don't know anything about meüòÄ and my experience. I can say any bullshit, that sounds confident. So you would be satisfied?

Pablo: Yes, becouse i collect a lot of of opinions and then make my own research. If you say bullshit i will see it in compare to all (reply to 9270)

User<5165612050>: is there any documentation on how the TON Contests Bot works

User<5165612050>: i verified but it doesn't say how to proceed from there

Seitaro: First you do verification via creation empty github repo and submitting your github username to bot, then you just send zip archive with solution to bot. (reply to 9275)

Mark: Not exactly on your topic, but I'm currently reading The Blask Swan by Nassim Taleb. He tells about the world abusing Normal Distribution and averaging. So  what is the point of comparing?

Slava: The correct way to approach this problem would be to hire a TON expert/team and then work with them to evaluate your project. (reply to 9258)

Pablo: Thx, thats good idea, but on current stage we build budget to show angel investors.  They want to see aproximatley spenings (reply to 9294)

Pablo: As fast as we have money we for sure hire developer

Pablo: And evaluate exact

Slava: I doubt any experienced investor will consider your project seriously if you don't have a technology expert on board prior the investment. It's a recipe for disaster to hire developers after the project is evaluated and without an expert developer to manage them in the first place.

isoscele üíé: where i ask clarifications about the description of an exercise of the smart challenge?

aler.eth: pip (reply to 9340)

Andrey: Try install from git, pip install git+https://github.com/disintar/toncli.git  I'm not sure that this will help because error seems very strange. But it's good first step :)

aler.eth: now it doesn't work at all :D

Andrey: You're using it from folder

Andy: I can't make toncli tests work. When I run "toncli run_tests", first it prints error: ( function invoke_method undefined ). Then it says build successful. Then there is several lines of weird logs, ending with error: Error interpreting file C:\Users\andyr\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpkuarq9x3.fif: contract_tests.fif:27:     }END>c:main procedure not defined  Then I looked into the "contract_tests.fif", and I found out that: 1. "AsmTests.fif" is not included in it. 2. "__test_gcd" (my test function) body (inside the {}) is empty.  I installed toncli following the instructions. Can anyone help me make tests work, please?

Alireza: just as a guess, check thee method_id of all test functions, they must be unique.  also check the following post on Ton Contest Chat (https://t.me/toncontests_chat) üëá (reply to 9350)

Alireza: Almost yes. Check this one. (this is one of my tests for the first task, I hope I will not be banned from the contest for this üòÖ)  Here is a small difference between testing getters or get-functions (like in this contest) and recv_internal or recv_external   Please, note that you need to specify unique function_selector  By default, for recv_internal it is 0 (and recv_external is -1). But for getters it is unique.  To get the function selector for your getter, you should run toncli build and then open ./build/contract.fif file and find there something like this 93344 DECLMETHOD gcd   93344 will be what are you looking for (forwarded from Illia Malovanyi)

Shawn: i don't understand you. (reply to 9337)

Andy: I didn't have method_id(0) I already use function selector to reference the function. Now there is a new error, which indicates that there is no code of the function. Error: Error interpreting file C:\Users\andyr\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpdft_qdou.fif: contract_tests.fif:27:     }END>c:invoke_method: procedure declared but left undefined  Here's the code of the test file: () __test_gcd() method_id(0) {     var (int gas_used, tuple results) = invoke_method(93344, [10, 15]); } (reply to 9352)

aler.eth: Guys, sorry for dumb questions.. but how to debug unexpected test failures?) Did func have something such as printf? My test failed on first check: throw_if(100, exit_code != 0); but how I can receive exit_code to figure out what happend?

isoscele üíé: nothing more than "dump_stack()" (reply to 9358)

aler.eth: oh.. i see. Thank you for help)

Daniil: there is dump() also (reply to 9359)

Daniil: ^ (reply to 9306)

Andy: I added some code to see what will happen in the generated fift code: int __test_gcd() method_id(0) {     int e = 100;     e~dump();     var (int gas_used, tuple results) = invoke_method(93344, [10, 15]);     return e; }  In the fift code:   __test_gcd PROC:<{     //      100 PUSHINT  //  e=100     s0 DUMP  //  e   }>  The error: contract_tests.fif:29:     }END>c:invoke_method: procedure declared but left undefined  So, I think that toncli somehow doesn't include the method. And I think this is somehow related to the fact that AsmTests.fif is not included in that file. Any ideas on how to fix this? (reply to 9356)

Seitaro: Try return (e, gas_used): looks like invoke_method is optimised out because result is not used (reply to 9365)

Andrey: I saw that func has special flag for warnings, think it's needed to pass output of func to toncli run. Guess it will help a lot for devs (reply to 9366)

Andy: Same error, fift code changed though.    __test_gcd PROC:<{     //      100 PUSHINT  //  e=100     s0 DUMP  //  e     93344 PUSHINT  //  e _6=93344     10 PUSHINT  //  e _6=93344 _8=10     15 PUSHINT  //  e _6=93344 _8=10 _9=15     PAIR  //  e _6=93344 _7     invoke_method CALLDICT  //  e _11 _12     DROP  //  e gas_used   }> (reply to 9366)

Ami: Hi, I have a question for those of you who run a validator on the network.  We are expected to have an upgrade today (which will follow by voting for the new config).  Are the validators expected to remove their stake from the elector before the upgrade? My concern is that in case there will be any issue with the upgrade the validator stake will be in danger.   What is the best approach here?

Danny: If I put the logical calculation of the product on the ton blockchain, do I not need a server to perform remote calculation?

talkol: The idea behind most blockchain dapps (not specific to TON), is to make the entire backend on-chain as smart contracts. It is recommended to avoid any servers for remote calculations. (reply to 9464)

Danny: Is this feasible?

Danny: If I want to make a board game, in order to show the fairness of the game, I put all the back-end computing on the blockchain. Is the effectiveness of this feasible?

talkol: Yes, definitely feasible to implement the logic of your game as a smart contact and then it‚Äôs guaranteed to be secure for all users.  Each transaction to change the game state will cost a few cents as gas. If this cost is an issue (for example your game has tens of thousands of transactions per player), then you can use payment channels to reduce this cost. (reply to 9469)

User<1398487233>: Hi Tal Kol. it runs and tests the deployed correctly but in your blog post you mentioned an address we could search to check if the app was active (reply to 9433)

User<1398487233>: also can I use the test suite and start writing smart contracts for the TON contest?

talkol: ‚Äúnpm run test‚Äù does not deploy the contract to the chain. It runs the tests locally in a simulation.  To deploy the contract to the chain and receive an address for it, you will need to deploy it with ‚Äúnpm run deploy‚Äù. You will need some TON for gas. What happens when you try to run it? (reply to 9481)

talkol: I‚Äôm not familiar with the rules of the contest but these tests are as good as running your contract in mainnet. If what you need to show works in these tests I can‚Äôt imagine it won‚Äôt be accepted (reply to 9482)

User<1398487233>: oh my bad.   npm run test works fine.   I ran npm run deploy with my wallet mnemonic in a .env file and it seemed to work but could not find any address to check the app (reply to 9483)

User<1398487233>: I will have to write new tests for the contest tasks right? (reply to 9484)

talkol: are you using the deploy script from the blog post? Or are you using the ones from the repo https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts? (reply to 9485)

User<1398487233>: cannot get the deploy script in blog to work(don't know ts) but I used  npm run build, npm run test and npm run deploy from the repo

talkol: Great, the repo scripts are good. Can you share the output of ‚Äúnpm run deploy‚Äù? What does it print on screen?  This line in the script https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts/blob/main/build/_deploy.ts#L126 should print the address of your deployed contract in an explorer

Slava: @talkol by the way, this looks dangerous. If I understand correctly, it will overwrite the existing .env file if for some reason DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC env var is falsy.  So, running $ DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC= npm run deploy will cause the existing .env file to be destroyed. And considering that it is in .gitignore this could be fatal :)

Slava: I would suggest to just exit with the error if DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC is missing and to introduce the generate command for things to be explicit.

talkol: Good idea. I‚Äôll look into this tomorrow, feel free to PR as well (reply to 9491)

Slava: By the way, have you thought about putting all this code into a separate npm library, so it could be upgraded for all users?

User<1398487233>: i checked the contract address on tonwhales but it is showing as not active

talkol: This is one of the most self explanatory script output ever designed üòÖ

talkol: I think the issue is the testnet

talkol: You need to check in a testnet explorer

User<1398487233>: i checked here, is this the right place?  https://sandbox.tonwhales.com/explorer/address/EQC-QTihJV_B4f8M2nynateMLynaRT_uwNYnnuyy87kam-G7

talkol: I‚Äôm personally against using testnets, I think they‚Äôre counter productive. Deploy on mainnet will cost a few cents, your time is worth more :)

talkol: I think TonWhales launched their own test net at some point that is different from where you deployed (reply to 9507)

talkol: This is why I hate testnets, they‚Äôre a mess and wallets don‚Äôt work well with them

talkol: Try a different explorer for testnet

User<1398487233>: hmm i dont know any

User<1398487233>: üòÖ

talkol: https://ton.app/explorers

talkol: Just make sure to click on the testnet version of each one

talkol: In any case, just deploy to mainnet. Much easier and much more stable. My philosophy that after testing locally using ‚Äúnpm run test‚Äù the next step is deploy to mainnet so you have a beta in the real world

talkol: You can deploy your contracts 100 times to mainnet, it costs nothing

User<1398487233>: is contract deployed in mainnet permanent?

talkol: Yes, but it‚Äôs just an address. Deploy again and get a different address

talkol: Unless you publish this address to users, nobody will know it exists

User<1398487233>: i checked the tonscan testnet, redeployed and it shows activity as just now

User<1398487233>: the address is the same address i used above so its working fine right?

Slava: That's not quite true. Someone could know if they would inspect the new blocks. (reply to 9522)

talkol: I meant that they wouldn‚Äôt care (reply to 9525)

Slava: Who knows :) (reply to 9526)

talkol: Anyone that sees your contract on mainnet can take its bytecode and deploy it 10 more times.. so the fact the contract is singular is meaningless

Slava: It could lead to a premature disclosure of some product for example.

talkol: but you have this problem on testnet too

Slava: If it's public then yes.

talkol: he deployed originally to a public testnet. I have yet to find any case where that would be advisable to do (reply to 9531)

Mark: What you say in this case is a gambler's fallacy I got this everywhere https://gist.github.com/oysstu/68072c44c02879a2abf94ef350d1c7c6

Mark: honesly I'v found so many crc16 implementations and everone is different...

Mark: I should have been told more specific in the task

Oleg: you need crc16 xmodem (reply to 9585)

Mark: thank! But how if doc says 2 bytes containing CRC16-CCITT of the previous 34 bytes ?

Oleg: last 2 bytes of address is crc16 of previous 34 bytes  i found c implementation, it might help  https://github.com/kelvinlawson/xmodem-1k/blob/master/crc16.c

Mark: oh my God. have you use this table?

Oleg: Hmm, where doc says about ccitt?

Mark: https://ton.org/docs/#/howto/step-by-step?id=_1-smart-contract-addresses

Mark: A) "Raw": < decimal workchain_id>:<64 hexadecimal digits with address>  B) "User-friendly", which is obtained by first generating:      one tag byte (0x11 for "bounceable" addresses, 0x51 for "non-bounceable"; add +0x80 if the address should not be accepted by software running in the production network)     one byte containing a signed 8-bit integer with the workchain_id (0x00 for the basic workchain, 0xff for the masterchain)     32 bytes containing 256 bits of the smart-contract address inside the workchain (big-endian)     2 bytes containing CRC16-CCITT of the previous 34 bytes

Mark: the last sentence

Andy: So in task 5, do we need to write base64url encoding function ourselves?

Mark: AAAAAAAA! that's why my solution doesn't work! probably (reply to 9595)

Andy: Lol you forgot about base64? :D

Oleg: Thats interesting, cause im using xmodem for addresses, and table is a bit diff, need to check node‚Äôs code for clarification, im pretty sure it works with xmodem (reply to 9593)

Mark: really))) I did it in my mirror code in python (since I haven't found any solution to debug the black box of TVM, I use python) but I forgot to do the same for func

Mark: it's interesting, cause the task says nothing about xmodem Only telepathy (reply to 9598)

Oleg: If task says ccitt, and no complains from other guys, then use ccitt i think :)

Oleg: Or it not works with ccitt?

Mark: I forgot about base64

Mark: I don't argue btw, I'm just not ure üôÇ If it works for you, you are right but the most interesting for me is how have you found the different answer (reply to 9601)

Mark: how did you build a table of the base64 alphabet. did you use the dict type?

Oleg: Im not participating contest, just developing library for go (reply to 9606)

ZEEGFA: is there any plan to make the Ledger App?

ZEEGFA: TON needs to be supported by hardware wallets.

ZEEGFA: first hardware wallets then an announcement for crosschain!!!

talkol: If you need a cold storage wallet, we published instructions on how to use one on a laptop not connected to the Internet:  https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-offline-transaction (reply to 9648)

talkol: Also there‚Äôs this: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ledger-app-ton (reply to 9648)

ZEEGFA: Thank you! it's abandoned... I wonder how the team has neglected such an important topic. (reply to 9652)

Tim: It's not abondoned, it's waiting for ledger to include ton app

ZEEGFA: 14 months ago... (reply to 9654)

altoshi: You can use ERC-20 Toncoin for ledger (reply to 9649)

ZEEGFA: Yes but it's not a suitable solution for the majority . hope to see some planning for it. (reply to 9656)

Tim: It's not about ton dev, there's currently 2 implenentations waiting for ledger to include them.

ZEEGFA: hmm, maybe TON Foundation must be involved or Ledger want $$$$ to speed up it. (reply to 9658)

talkol: Not abandoned. It was written by core team. They‚Äôre very busy on other things in roadmap.  Also, the standard of how to sign transactions is not changing on monthly basis so this library does not need to be actively maintained. I think the Bitcoin Ledger app was last updated 5 years ago :) (reply to 9653)

talkol: I think a hot wallet on iPhone native app with FaceID and a cold wallet on an offline laptop is a good security combination. iPhone native apps are sandboxed well, it‚Äôs miles safer than MetaMask or a browser extension

talkol: Also you can work with the Ledger app manually until Ledger accept it officially

talkol: Also, TON‚Äôs web3.js like library - TonWeb - supports the client side Ledger part:  https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/ledger/AppTon.js

·Ö†: As this https://t.me/tondev_eng/5657 is hidden behind many other pinned messages, it would be helpful to put it in the chat description as a Read this first...

Steven: Thanks

talkol: difficult for me to answer because we simply don‚Äôt use Fift in our development flow at all. We explicitly stopped using Fift and we‚Äôre not wanting for anything (reply to 9677)

Mark: Is there any cause? Some issues? (reply to 9683)

talkol: No, it‚Äôs just complicated and not required for anything. Deploying, testing and building from TypeScript is considered easier if you don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with Fift (reply to 9685)

Mark: On the contest there was a benefit of using fift to try and catch over the function It‚Äôs not a usual case? (reply to 9686)

talkol: Not familiar with the contest. Can you explain a bit more on the use case you found it useful?

Daniil: 3rd task was to verify if some message cell is a valid or not (by tl-b scheme)  And it was much easier to write some function that just parses some valid message, and then call that function with TRY CATCH and if at some point there is an error, this message is invalid.  But currently there is no try-catch in func so we just declared asm function (reply to 9688)

talkol: I assume over time these features should be added to func itself, they‚Äôre much too low level for most people to do them manually now in asm  Maybe there‚Äôs a way to incorporate this as a stdlib function?

Daniil: I don't think it's too low level Just a single asm function with the TRYARGS and CALLDICT (reply to 9690)

talkol: Can you paste the code? We‚Äôll be very happy to learn this pattern (reply to 9691)

talkol: Like a GitHub gist showing how to do it and an example where it‚Äôs useful?

Daniil: (int, tuple) trycatch (cell message) impure asm "<{ validate_message_exception CALLDICT }> CONT <{ invalid_message CALLDICT }> CONT 1 2 TRYARGS"; ... ... ... (int, tuple) validate_message (cell message) impure method_id {     (int good, tuple result) = trycatch(message);     return (good, result); }  that's what I did. validate_message_exception returns result on success and may throw exception if something goes wrong, and invalid_message just returns the result that is required in case of an invalid message  basically declare two functions, one will be like a TRY block, and another one will be like a CATCH block, and then do TRY/TRYARGS in asm (reply to 9692)

Daniil: actually I think I was able to just rename trycatch function to validate_message and get the same result

Daniil: there was a ready example code for each task in contest, which contained a declared function with required name/return types/args types, I just didn't want to remove it :D

talkol: hmm not familiar with the contest question so this is a bit out of context :)

Vladimir: I participated in the contest and I already received my award.  I thank a lot the TON Foundation for this contest. I learned and although I was in place 47, it satisfies me that I could participate using as operating system adJ that is a distribution of OpenBSD.  Here is the patch for the TON tools I sent in orther to compile the basic tools: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/430   Here is a package for the ton tools for OpenBSD/adJ: https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/adJ/tree/main/arboldes/usr/ports/mystuff/net/ton  And here a full distribution of the version 7.1b2 of adJ that includes the ton package: http://adj.pasosdejesus.org/pub/AprendiendoDeJesus/endesarrollo/

Vladimir: Some time ago I also could compile and use mytonctrl on adJ/OpenBSD, however I don't have expensive hardware neither the money to set a validator node.    But I think I can set up and keep running a collator node using as operating system OpenBSD/adJ that IMHO would be more secure than Linux.   Starting with testnet is any validator interested in a collator node running on OpenBSD/adJ ? (reply to 9704)

isoscele üíé: address can start more versions starting with UQ or EQ whats the diff

Daniil: Yeah.. are there more types of addresses than just bounceable and non-bounceable?  Why when I'm entering some address like kf..... into tonscan,  it shows something like EQ.....  Is it just another string format (not base64) or what? (reply to 9730)

Shayan: kf... is for test-only. From the docs (for the first byte of the address): "... add +0x80 if the address should not be accepted by software running in the production network" (reply to 9731)

Alexander: Hi, guys. Need assistant!)    How to get smart contract's jetton wallet address from this smart contract? So after deployment it will have its jetton wallet addr inside.

talkol: How are you deploying your Jetton? (reply to 9733)

Alexander: It's not about jetton. I want to have my smart contract's jetton wallet address in its storage to validate inbound messages which come from that jetton wallet.   I can't store it in the smart contract's storage during the deployment, because jetton wallet addr is generated by a smart contract address.   So I must init this field after deployment. It would be great to have op::get_wallet_address inside jetton minter standard. (reply to 9734)

Alexander: "To validate inbound messages" - I mean op::transfer_notification

talkol: You are correct that this problem is circular. The address of your contract depends on its initial data cell which contains the Jetton wallet address. The address of the Jetton wallet depends on your contract address.  You will need to break the loop. One way to do it, is deploy your contract with zero set as the Jetton wallet address. And add a new op that sets this address if it is zero (after deployment). (reply to 9735)

Alexander: In my case I can't believe this op, cause anyone can deploy this smart contract. So it must validate it by itself.  I came up with the following solution: - Another (MAIN) smart contract, which can be trusted, send some jettons through it's wallet to just created smart. - Smart contract checks that from_addr == MAIN addr and saves sender addr as its jetton wallet addr.   ^ unfortunately, it doesn't work, because anyone can send this message from any contract, using correct payload  "    var msg_body = begin_cell()         .store_uint(op::transfer_notification(), 32)         .store_uint(query_id, 64)         .store_coins(jetton_amount)         .store_slice(from_address)         .store_slice(either_forward_payload)         .end_cell();"

talkol: You will need to explain more about your use case. When you say anyone can deploy your contract, how does that happen?

Dario: Anyone can fake such message (reply to 9738)

Dario: The jetton standard doesn't define smc-side get calls

Alexander: THat's what I wrote (reply to 9740)

Dario: So its not possible at all

Dario: Yeah thats why I deleted the message (reply to 9743)

talkol: @dariolol you have this use case in your DEX, how did you approach it? Did you make your pairs unique? Or you can deploy multiple contract instances for the same pair?

Dario: Its not the same, i cant explain too much right now. But pairs are unique and there is no difference between USDT/WTON and WTON/USDT

talkol: @dariolol in your code, are you making an assumption the underlying jettons are using the same implementation of this function: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/2c13d3ef61ca4288293ad65bf0cfeaed83879b93/ft/jetton-utils.fc#L27 ?

Dario: No

Dario: The dex works with any token that accomplish the standard

Dario: Even if its a fake address that mimic a jetton wallet

talkol: so how do you get the correct address of your pair jetton wallet? it can‚Äôt be given during construction

Dario: Can't say now. The code will be open sourced pretty soon üòÉ

talkol: Haha, eventually everybody will have similar code. I don‚Äôt think hiding good security approaches due to competition is the way forward :)

Alexander: I will share mine when I find one üòÅ

Alexander: Is it connected with the jetton code somehow? üôÉ

Dario: Open sourcing it Right now would create at least a couple of clone based on the logic i designed. I dont think its a good idea, we should let the developers to develop their own idea from scratch (reply to 9754)

Dario: Nope, not really (reply to 9756)

Dario: But LP jettons (minted when providing liquidity) are mostly standard jettons

Alexander: Yeah, we have the same (reply to 9759)

Dario: You think so? (reply to 9760)

Alexander: It's not unsafe, there will be no liquidity provided (reply to 9760)

Alexander: So it will be empty pair smart contract that is not a problem

Dario: Yes, and even if the pool has some fake tokens you still need to provide the real one* (reply to 9765)

shahar: Announcing that we‚Äôve added the ability to update metadata for jettons in jetton.live (if the admin was not revoked). Enjoy!

Roman: üëã Hello, devs!  I want to improve documentation, and I want to make it more newcomers-friendly. ü•∞  Right now, the project is in closed beta. I'm looking for developers who have problems with even starting to read current documentation.  You have an opportunity to become the first user and provide feedback so I can improve the final version with your help! üòé  If you're interested, feel free to PM :)

Janna: Hello team! At the moment we are using public nodes which are quite slow and we want to speed up the TON work - do you have any instructions on how to launch lightserver maybe? (it‚Äôs not working through mycontrol).

Narek: We‚Äôre pleased to announce the completion of the work on the Soulbound NFT (SBT) grant.  SBT is special kind of NFT where a user can only hold one, and it cannot be transferred to anyone else.  Huge thanks to @xssnik, who worked hard on the smart contract and on the standard proposal. Also big thanks to TON Punks (@punkton) for doubling the grant‚Äôs budget.  As a result of this grant, we came up with a draft of the standard and reference implementation of contracts.  Now we want to invite developers to a public discussion of this draft before sending it for approval to the TON Foundation.  This is big news for the TON NFT community because adopting this standard will open up many new possibilities and mechanics for NFTs on TON.  We can‚Äôt wait for developers and artists to use this new technology in their products.  And of course, we will support working with SBTs on Getgems as soon as the TON Foundation approves our standard proposal.  Stay tuned for more news! (forwarded from TonTech)

Nacho: Hey there! I'm working at an exchange and we're integrating TON into our end, we need to check in which block is a transaction located and I don't know if there's some endpoint or something in order to do this. Note: I'm still trying to understand the chain structure since there's a mainchain, workchains and shardchains and it confuses me. Thanks in advance :3

Roman: Hey, isn't it the answer?  https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/transactions/get_try_locate_tx_tryLocateTx_get (reply to 9811)

talkol: Workchain 0 is where 99% of the user action happens. Master chain (-1) is used mostly by the validators for PoS elections stuff (reply to 9811)

Nacho: I will try it, thanks for answering! üôÇ (reply to 9814)

Artemiy: Hey there! I have a smart contract that accepts messages from users. I would like to keep a history of requests. Tell me, please, how can I save a list of pairs (address, text of the message)? Do I understand correctly that I cannot use tuple for such a case because it has a limit of 256 entries? Are there any best practices for storing such a dynamic list?

–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π: Interestingly that the fourh task in ton challenge event was about making linked list out of the tuple. You can find solutions for that. You can store in the map, but you have to realize that you are paying for just storing, so with a big number of messages the price would raise. So at least consider eviction of old messages or reading and storing locally with removing request, unless low number of the messages are expected. (reply to 9905)

Dario: Right now, i think there are only https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/math.func and https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/utils.func (reply to 9940)

Dario: If you need something else, just let me know

defuera: ok, cool, that's what I thought. Then I'll read standards, check examples and will follow them myself. I'm working a simple interface to create NFT collections :)

Dario: Then probably you only need standard contracts

defuera: Ok, another question, with toncli (by disintar) can I run program locally or I have to deploy to testnet?

Andrey: You can run program locally with old or new tests. The most easiest way to do it - use docker from community contributor @trinketer22 -> https://github.com/Trinketer22/func_docker (reply to 9945)

Be the Future of Web3: II will try runmx thanks.  have a computer language that I want to use to run the stack machine with. My language has a front end now and runs on another stack machine here is a link to the front end https://3.0.183.52/. I want to port over to Ton by mapping the  stack manipulation primitives from my current primitaves - Opt Codes of Algorand stack machine. Plans for formally verifying the smart contract are underway so I want to be as close to metal as possible.

talkol: Cool project! In any case, there‚Äôs another interesting project you should know, https://github.com/Naltox/ton-contract-executor  It runs the TVM isolated in web assembly. So if you prefer JS environment to C++, you can run the op codes in a pretty isolated way (reply to 9985)

defuera: Hey guys, could you advice, what's happening here? I'm trying to get an error when executing a non existing method on a smart contract, but getting some result

Narek: Hey, everyone!  Today we are launching our third grant for NFT contracts.  It‚Äôs easy to describe the idea in a few words: We want to allow users to swap their NFTs so that you can exchange your NFT for another user‚Äôs NFT safely and without selling it first and then buying it again.  From a technical standpoint, there are some interesting problems to solve, such as the distribution of marketplace fees among the participants of the transaction and ensuring the safe transfer of the NFTs.  We are looking for a person or a team that will develop a smart contract for P2P NFT transfers on GitHub using our technical specification.  The grant is 1,000 TON.  Grant applicants are expected to send a short intro and a cover letter to apply for the grant directly to @Narek.  We are planning to approve one team (or a separate individual) to work on this project.

Slava: Hey! There is a so-called highload wallet that allows you to send multiple transfers via a single external call to the wallet. However, the main idea is to increase the throughput of the wallet not to optimize the fees.

TON technical overview: From first glance it looks like translation of docs on ton.org? (reply to 10105)

User<59608113>: Not really

blitzbyte: looks like i need to ask second time  how to create a private ton network like i can on ethereum?

Andy: yeah, on 2 of them it literally says exactly that (reply to 10119)

User<59608113>: that's true (reply to 10122)

altoshi: There is still no 100% working DEX on TON. (reply to 10091)

talkol: they‚Äôre in various beta stages but several are already fully featured (reply to 10124)

altoshi: But they are still not live ;) (reply to 10125)

talkol: What do you mean by a private network? What exactly are you trying to do? (reply to 10121)

altoshi: He means local chain (reply to 10127)

talkol: For testing? What purpose?

blitzbyte: yes (reply to 10130)

blitzbyte: testing

talkol: There‚Äôs MyLocalTon which is a local version of ton that supposedly works on your machine

talkol: But for testing there are other approaches that are better

talkol: toncli is a tool in Python that many people use and like, I‚Äôm a fan of the TypeScript stack that looks like hardhat from Ethereum

Dario: Actually, there is (reply to 10126)

altoshi: You can use test network for it (reply to 10132)

altoshi: STON.Fi is not 100% working (reply to 10136)

talkol: If you‚Äôre talking about ganache, then ganache is not really a full Ethereum chain, it‚Äôs just bare bones EVM implemented in JS. We have something similar in TON called https://github.com/Naltox/ton-contract-executor which is very similar, it runs the TVM in web assembly and is an amazing tool for testing (reply to 10132)

altoshi: I recommend you Tonkeeper (reply to 10085)

talkol: If you want to see an example project working with it with live tests then look at https://github.com/ton-defi-org/tonstarter-contracts (reply to 10132)

blitzbyte: i want to create my own chain (reply to 10141)

talkol: Like a private fork? (reply to 10142)

altoshi: You mean Workchain? (reply to 10142)

talkol: Can you give an example from Etheruem ecosystem so we better understand?

Nick: I must notice that not everything works in ton-contract-executor, so it isn‚Äôt a complete replacement of a real network. Also it isn‚Äôt convenient to test multi-contract interactions in ton-contract-executor. That‚Äôs why I use MyLocalTon. It depends on what you need. (reply to 10139)

talkol: Adding multi contract to ton-contract-executor is not a hard task

Nick: Not actually you, @talkol, but the guy who asked üòÅ

talkol: @Narek has big plans for ton-contract-executor, once we all have some more free time to help him and work on them it will cover everything ganache does plus more. Multi contracts included out of the box. Now you can do multi contract but it takes a little effort to do the routing yourself

Andrey: https://github.com/disintar/ton-k8s

Andrey: @SsNiPeR1 private network compose & k8s

blitzbyte: any sidechain (reply to 10145)

blitzbyte: anyone can create a genesis.json file

talkol: like polygon? (reply to 10152)

blitzbyte: maybe yes (reply to 10154)

blitzbyte: polygon is a side chain

blitzbyte: not connected to mainnet

altoshi: OrbsüòÅ (reply to 10152)

talkol: If you just need a simulated environment for testing this is one thing, if you need production is something else

talkol: Polygon took the core Ethereum code base and made some changes to incorporate their own PoS consensus

Andrey: In TON genesis is fift file :)   Check out it here: https://github.com/disintar/ton-k8s/blob/master/ton-compile-source/contracts/gen-zerostate.fif (reply to 10153)

talkol: It‚Äôs pretty similar to how testnet is being run, the testnet is a TON side chain in ‚Äúproduction‚Äù

Nikita: What would be your suggestions on some basic pet projects for studying main concepts of ton? (After doing SC for storing the total number of received messages)

talkol: Create a Rock Paper Scissors game on ton where two players deposit 1 ton to play, they play via a smart contract, and the winner takes 2 ton  This game really shows why you need blockchain because without blockchain it‚Äôs very hard to make without a trusted party (reply to 10163)

talkol: With ton this can be made that two total strangers will play fairly without trusting anyone

Nikita: Yeaaah, cool one! Thanks! (reply to 10164)

talkol: If you need help to architect it, like how both submit their choices without the other player knowing - ask here, there‚Äôs a nice trick to it :)

talkol: And you can create a nice Telegram bot UI for this so people can actually play together

talkol: And if your code is nice and tested, I‚Äôll help you push this example project to the official docs üòä

Jorge Alejandro: Hey, I heard from the DevChat on Spanish, something about Ten Lessons for learning FunC. Are those video Lessons? (reply to 10165)

Nikita: i know about this one (reply to 10170)

Dan: Released FunC Support for VS Code v1.0.0  Large release supported by ton-society üöÄüòé  - New FunC syntax: constants, strings and compiler directives - Simple includes analysis - Refactoring local variables - Variable type inference & type suggestions in completion - Code formatter - Minor grammar & markdown fixes (forwarded from Dan)

talkol: That‚Äôs amazing! What‚Äôs the official download link? (reply to 10175)

Dan: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonwhales.func-vscode

talkol: @dvlkv Is there a way to run the syntax highlighting part outside VSCode? For example to create an online IDE for FunC?

Dan: yep

Dan: extension uses tree-sitter grammar compiled in wasm, and TextMate markdown

Dan: so at the beginning you can just try to find editor with TextMate support

Eton: tonkeeper is for mobile phone. Maybe have some recommendation for web and phone? maybe have something same like metamask ? (reply to 10140)

altoshi: TON Wallet, but it doesn‚Äôt support NFTs, tokens (reply to 10182)

Hemi: Hi! Our DEX, TonSwap (@TonSwapOfficialBot) is live on mainnet. Ping me to discuss your project (reply to 10092)

talkol: There is a Chrome extension in https://ton.app/wallets that should be familiar to you. Much like MetaMask, it‚Äôs mostly for interacting with dapps, it‚Äôs not a very good wallet by itself as its NFT and token support is limited, so if you bought an NFT you won‚Äôt be able to see it there automatically (reply to 10182)

talkol: In general, ton mission is mass adoption so the focus in general is on a mobile first approach - unlike wallet connect on Ethereum which is clunky, we‚Äôre trying real hard to achieve a smooth end to end mobile app flow, meaning you browse a dapp through an integrated browser in Telegram or Instagram and then jump to your native app wallet to sign transactions and then jump back. These standards are still work in progress and not all wallets support them, if you‚Äôre excited about this part you can contribute it‚Äôs under active work

Yang: Do you have a video showing the exchange process? (reply to 10184)

Omid: How to introduce the project to TON and chat with support? does anyone know

Omid: hi

Omid: Is it possible to transfer NFTs to Metamask?

Nick: Nope. Different blockchains. No any NFT bridges. Impossible at the moment. (reply to 10197)

User<59608113>: Super, thanks

User<59608113>: Did anybody face "Rate limit exceeded: 1 per 1 second" on the toncenter.com RPC?

Slava: You will need to use the API key to overcome the limitation. (reply to 10205)

Slava: However, it's better to run your own instance of the toncenter for production.

User<59608113>: Thank you sooo much, man! I'll definitely run my own instance for production, but now we are starting a pilot test with a few clients and I think this one will be enough.

Eton: Oke. Thank you üôèüèª Sure, Will Ping you later.  I still noob In TON, still alot of things To learn here (reply to 10184)

User<5052057207>: you can try it yourself by getting some toncoin and having them on Tonhub (another wallet on TON in addition to Tonkeeper) (reply to 10188)

isoscele üíé: I have amd cpu and linux. There's no way i can use pytonlib ?

Alexander: I believe you can build tonlibjson by yourself?  In case it is not possible you can try tonsdk, there is an example of the TonCenter provider. Perhaps it is possible to migrate it to the pytonlib (haven't used it) (reply to 10238)

Ruslan: Ofc you can. Try pip install pytonlib first of all

isoscele üíé: im asking cause of this (reply to 10240)

Ruslan: You have amd, or typo? (reply to 10238)

isoscele üíé: yes amd

Ruslan: We‚Äôll fix this mistake

Ruslan: So, this will work for u (reply to 10240)

Ruslan: Moreover, arm64=aarch64 is also compatible now. Next step: RISC-VüòÉ

Slava: What about SPARC? üòÅ (reply to 10248)

Slava: Hey @andreypfau ! Do you have a string-manipulation methods in your Kotlin library? I can't find any in Builder/Slice.

Andrey: BitString?

Slava: yep (reply to 10258)

Andrey: https://github.com/andreypfau/ton-kotlin/wiki/TON-Kotlin-documentation#ton-bitstring (reply to 10259)

Slava: I mean, no. I'm talking about general strings like "hello world". E.g. slice.loadString();‚Ä¶ (reply to 10260)

Andrey: slice.loadBits(10)

Slava: You mean slice.loadBits(8 * byteLength)? (reply to 10262)

Andrey: yep size in bits in args

Andrey: if you want load byteArray: slice.loadBits(10*Byte.SIZE_BITS).toByteArray()

Slava: Are you planning to add more specific methods for strings or are you happy with the current approach?

Andrey: what you mean as String?

Andrey: UTF-8 string?

Slava: Sure (reply to 10268)

Andrey: .toByteArray().toString(Charsets.UTF_8)

Andrey: its inbuilt method in kotlin-stdlib .-.

User<74193954>: try to run on 20.04, works like a charm for me (reply to 10280)

Ruslan: Wait a bit) Maybe I know where to find correct binaries

talkol: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-binaries

Ruslan: Meanwhile you can try to build it with the following dockerfile: https://github.com/kdimentionaltree/ton-builder/blob/main/amd64.Dockerfile (reply to 10281)

talkol: I created a repo with binaries for all operating systems with simple installation instructions like dependencies. If you find any mistake in it please submit a PR to fix (reply to 10285)

Ruslan: There is no binaries for 22.04üòÖ (reply to 10287)

talkol: Pretty sure 18 binaries work, please check and if they work then let‚Äôs update the README and if it doesn‚Äôt work, let‚Äôs compile them together and put it there in a new line (reply to 10288)

Ruslan: Nope) In 18 and 20 there were OpenSSL 1.1.1 package

talkol: Oh right it was 20 that the 18 worked for

Ruslan: It is not available in 22.04 and, therefore, one should recompile binaries with 3.0

talkol: Cool, so now when you figure it out upload the good binaries to this repo :)

talkol: So it‚Äôs easier for the next person

Ruslan: Please, try to use this binary: (reply to 10281)

Ruslan: To build it you can use this script: https://github.com/kdimentionaltree/ton-builder/blob/main/build_ubuntu-22.sh Docker is required

Slava: A word of advice. Of course you can trust Ruslan here, but be very cautious before running the binaries uploaded in chats :) (reply to 10295)

Microwave: Hello, i found something in ton dns nft-item smart contract.  Does it means that if owner didn‚Äôt make transfers during the year - his nft domain will be released?

·Ö†: If the owner forgets to make a payment of 0.000000001 TON or is in hospital or prison or in grief etc then yes and the new owner will receive all future payments if the previous owner attached it to their wallet and if the new owner now attaches it to their wallet. üëè (reply to 10302)

Andy: Is this small amount of TON the cost of keeping the domain? (reply to 10303)

·Ö†: Yes (reply to 10304)

Andy: üòØ

·Ö†: So first you may pay a very high price for a short domain say 1000 TON. In one year say Ton equals 100 dollars you have a valuable domain assuming Ton becomes the blockchain to unite all other blockchains. But for one nano Ton you may lose it though I expect there may be bots created to renew it on your behalf every year? But the additional ‚Äúbonus‚Äù is attaching it to Wallets a great or terrible idea depending which side you‚Äôre on, not to mention it‚Äôs easier to mistype a domain than copy and paste an address. (reply to 10306)

Andy: Can other addresses pay for your domain? (reply to 10307)

·Ö†: No (reply to 10308)

Andy: That's unfortunate. It could be easily done with a smart contract :P

·Ö†: Yes I guess that‚Äôs the way to go. And presumably someone makes it easy for laypeople to do auto renewals. (reply to 10310)

Andy: Sounds like a project idea!

talkol: Consider that the core team decided to implement it this way for a reason :) I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a mistake. I think the goal was to minimize squatting of domains by requiring domains owners to prove ‚Äúthey are alive‚Äù every year. Maybe the better project is to create a reminder service? (reply to 10309)

Andy: Yeah now that I think about it it does make sense that the actual owner should pay the nano ton

·Ö†: It needs to be more than a reminder. Life can get in the way. An actual renewal would be the way to go and wouldn‚Äôt prevent squatting but then the price is equivalent to web 2 domains for life only far fewer can yet access it. (reply to 10313)

Dmitry: Hey guys. Trying to build .fif file by fift and got an error

defuera: did you set FIFTPATH env variable in ur bash.rc or whatever you are using there? (reply to 10317)

Dmitry: no. I did everything from https://ton.org/docs/#/compile?id=download-global-config But when I run func or fift i got Command 'func' not found, did you mean: (reply to 10318)

defuera: if you read the error you will see that it tells you, you need env variable named FIFTPATH

Dmitry: What is the command I need to setup it? (reply to 10320)

defuera: do you know what is environment variable?

Microwave: professionals squatters will build or use autorenewal services. I don't thinks that solution minimize squatting at all. I think it's maximize squatting for those, how's made services to follow domains of simple people and release them after year past. Is there any way to buy domain for more then year without required updates every year? (reply to 10313)

Dmitry: As i understand it means I need to create relation between fift file and global variable (reply to 10322)

defuera: yeap üëç

Dmitry: So if im correct something like export FIFTPATH=./ton-build/crypto/fift ? (reply to 10325)

defuera: you can google from here on üòâ

defuera: and test ur env variable with echo from the shell

Slava: Yeah, I've thought the same. Squatters will be the last people who will be affected by the problem of domain renewals because it's a business for them, so they have resources to automate everything. (reply to 10323)

Slava: The better idea in my opinion would be to have a subscription, where your wallet will automatically pay for the domain each year. And the renewal price should be substantial to make it more reasonable (to avoid excessive domain holding). However, this is not the right chat to discuss this :)

Microwave: but where the right chat to discuss this?

Slava: I guess the general chat would be a good fit.

Slava: However still, there must be a party to initiate the payment. (reply to 10330)

Slava: I guess it would be cool to have some messaging protocol for wallet software, so we could send and display messages to wallet owners. That way it would be possible to implement renewal notifications.

·Ö†: It‚Äôs not reminders that‚Äôs the problem. From experience. A war turns life upside down. Or you lose your family and are in unspeakable pain. Having paid a ton of Ton for your domain, losing it for failing to pay a nano ton is very unfair in such circumstances. Or in hospital in a coma to wake up and your domains and phone numbers and email addresses are gone. Hopefully developers can find solutions. (reply to 10334)

Microwave: Developers will find solutions for those, how knows about problem. But i didn't see that this mechanism describes in TON auction description. How they will know? (reply to 10335)

talkol: I agree that professional squatters will not be affected, but at least most whales are discouraged from squatting as investment assuming domains is not their core business (reply to 10329)

Anil Kutty | Heymate: Hi there, We are looking to create a DAO on TON and move the software assets owned by a very small community (largely developers) there. We intend to continue development and also integrate with TON. Is there tooling available to do that, if not what would you recommend we do until the relevant tooling becomes available. Any guidance is appreciated, thanks!

davide: Hi everyone, Where can I found documentation about Ton Payments?

talkol: Payment channels or just in general accepting payments? (reply to 10339)

talkol: This is payment channels:  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/payment-channels  https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/tree/master/src/contract/payments

talkol: Payment channels let you reduce the gas if you have many small payments between two parties

talkol: If you have just a single payment and gas is not an issue, then you just need to write a small backend in Python or Node.js that will check if your wallet was paid  https://ton.org/docs/#/payment-processing/deposits-single-wallet  https://society.ton.org/how-ton-wallets-work-and-how-to-access-them-from-javascript

davide: this thank you so much, have a nice day (reply to 10341)

Slava: Hello! What tooling are you talking about exactly? (reply to 10338)

Anil Kutty | Heymate: @slavafomin  There are many like  the above pic

Slava: That's too vague to ask.

Anil Kutty | Heymate: more specifically, looking for tools for  1) Asset management: manage the fractional ownership of the asset (software Copyright/IP etc being the asset), managing a typical balance sheet would be a plus 2) voting/governance tooling for roadmapping (but could be offchain too like Snapshot does or an extended version of telegram voting)  Can elaborate more over a DM, can I?

Slava: This chat is for development questions and it looks like you are looking for a final software?

Anil Kutty | Heymate: Or maybe something coming in the near future so we can plan to migrate to it

talkol: the voting part please speak to @mrbonezy - he is leading a project for that (reply to 10349)

Oleg: New version of TON golang library üíé tonutils v1.2.0      1. Jettons support + examples     2. DNS domains support + examples     3. NFT Index field type changed to *big.Int     4. Send and return msg hash + find transaction by msg hash (by @iam047801)     5. Send and wait for transaction hash (by @iam047801)     6. Auto repeat send of external message when waiting for transaction more than expected.     7. Method for local check of contract code if it has specific method.     8. Added descriptions for contract method exec return codes     9. Fixed run get method workchain for masterchain addresses.     10. TLB loader/serializer fix of small size *big.Int     11. Onchain content serialize fix     12. GetByIntKey method for dictionary (get value using big.Int key instead of cell)     13. Increased test coverage  https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go

Tim: Now imagine that we heard about it, but still think the same (reply to 10389)

talkol: Why does it need to be privacy preserving? Many yield optimizers are fine with the regular pseudo-anonymity, why isn‚Äôt it enough?

talkol: Is it because of the MEV?

talkol: We‚Äôre just trying to understand your use case

Slava: Security by obscurity? ) (reply to 10402)

Slava: This is not a development question. Use the official page to track your domain auction status. (reply to 10407)

talkol: I‚Äôm not aware of anything like that part of TON core, so I assume you will have to implement these primitives in FunC. I‚Äôm also not aware of any FunC library where somebody already implemented them (reply to 10405)

Matthew: I was thinking more to browse questions and see what people are posting and commenting but ya that‚Äôs a good point. I‚Äôm def curious what software development could look like on a mobile phone in the future, not sure if it‚Äôs gonna happen, but you gotta wonder if it might, and if it does, how it would work haha (edit: I know you can do it already with some apps but obvs it‚Äôs not very nice or designed properly for mobile) (reply to 10431)

Matthew: I just enjoy using my phone a lot more than my laptop

Slava: Most programmers I know are buying more and bigger screens to make their work more efficient, it looks counter-productive to go for a phone üòÅ

Andy: you can code on a tablet with vscode in the browser and an external keyboard already (reply to 10433)

Matthew: Right but I mean with just on screen mobile keyboard. It would be cool to be able to just lie on the couch and code for example haha. (reply to 10436)

Andy: you can probably do that on a phone too but the screen is just too small

Matthew: But like for example the syntax for a lot of programming languages is not mobile friendly, having to type these esoteric characters and keys. Either you gotta improve the keyboard, or make a more mobile friendly syntax

Matthew: Iunno man, a lot of screen time is spent on phones nowadays, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to be able to design and build on the things we use most often? Haha (reply to 10438)

talkol: From time to time I‚Äôm taking repeat questions that people ask here and add them to stackoverflow, I think it‚Äôs a good investment if anyone else wants to help :)

Matthew: Steve are you trying to figure out how to use that bot inside of telegram? like what commands you can type and give it?

Slava: There is an API for @CryptoBot, maybe you can look into that instead. (reply to 10452)

Matthew: seems like this is what Slava‚Äôs talking about https://help.crypt.bot/crypto-pay-api

davide: hi guys! what you think about TACT?

‚Äî 2022-09-02 ‚Äî

Matthew: Anyone have any insight behind the name jetton? I googled the definition of if and I guess I can kind of see the point of it. I searched in the token standard issue in the TIPs repo to see if there was any insight behind the choice of that name and didn‚Äôt really find anything  (Edit: and ya I decided this dev channel would be the best / most appropriate place to ask, as opposed to general chat or something. If that was a bad choice lmk)

Andy: my personal guess is that jetton is how you pronounce the word "token" translated to Russian.   You can listen to it in the translator: https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ru&text=token&op=translate (reply to 10470)

Matthew: Oh ha well there you go lol. As a native English speaker who doesn‚Äôt know any other languages I‚Äôve never heard or seen the word jetton before but apparently it‚Äôs a legit one with a meaning that does have some relationship to tokens haha

Andrew: https://translate.google.com/?sl=ru&tl=en&text=%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%BD&op=translate (reply to 10471)

–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª: moreover you can treat this as "jet TON" which sounds cool

Mr. John: Jetton in russian is actually coin, that you put in something like arcade machine

altoshi: ERC-20 token at ton blockchain (reply to 10470)

Mr. John: Also in some cities jettons used as subway fare

Matthew: In English what we use for arcades and subway stations are called tokens

·Ö†: Token in Russian is –∂–µ—Ç–æ–Ω (written in Russian alphabet as Jeton) with the J pronounced as the Zs at the beginning of Zsa Zsa Gabor if you happen to know her. She lived to 100 years! (reply to 10479)

Mr. John: So –∂–µ—Ç–æ–Ω (jetton) = token (reply to 10479)

Matthew: Lol. I don‚Äôt but it‚Äôs cool to know her now (reply to 10481)

Dmitry: The word jeton is French actually. It has the same meaning in French as token in English.

·Ö†: Yes pronunciation is the same in French. The J like French word for Japanese: Japonais or July, ‚ÄúJuillet‚Äù etc. (reply to 10484)

Andrey: Saint Petersburg yay (reply to 10477)

Mr. John: there are no more jettons in Moscow (reply to 10486)

Andrey: "Troyka" moment (reply to 10487)

Mr. John: also there are holey jettons in Nizjniy Novgorod

Andrey: Samara and Kazan also (reply to 10489)

talkol: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeton

talkol: It ends with ‚Äúton‚Äù so obviously fitting, also in casinos, the plastic tokens you get that are equal to cash IMO are called the same

talkol: The word indeed originated from French, but was adopted in many other languages like Russian

Matthew: I‚Äôve never been to a casino, so maybe it‚Äôs a more common word than I realize. And yes v true, it does end with ton

talkol: TON Foundation is announcing a reward program to incentivize community activity and engagement on StackOverflow. We want to help the community build a TON knowledge library on StackOverflow so that any developer can ask and answer questions about TON. We want to build this on StackOverflow for several reasons:  Strong search engine optimization, which translates to better search engine results  StackOverflow dominates web search results. When any developer (from TON-curious to TON-native) uses Google to search, we want them to find an answer efficiently on the first page. We cannot expect TON to become a leading layer-1 blockchain without such a knowledge-base optimization.  Reuse old answers to help new people  Developers are usually struggling with similar issues and problems. We want to avoid a scenario where developers get stuck and ask a previously answered question if they can find an archived answer easily.  Questions asked on developer chats get washed down the drain  Most of the TON dev community is asking questions in the various Telegram chat groups. Questions asked there get buried in the chat stream. It becomes difficult to search for old answers and all the valuable knowledge does not get archived for later efficient search.  Here is the concept:  1. Every first working day of the month, we will reward with Toncoin and special NFTs the top 10 most active people who answer questions and the top 3 questions* for the trailing 30-days with the TON tag from the dashboard.     *Please note that the top winners will be subject to post-moderation in order to prevent cheating.    2. Use only the [TON] tag ‚Äî please, do not add any sub-tags. Avoid creating sub-tags that will branch out the taxonomy. For example, do not add [func], [fift], [toncli], etc. We want to concentrate all efforts in the same place to reach the critical mass faster. We will encourage the use of [TON] tag + specific word search in the title. Thus, questions should have a comprehensive title that covers the respective topic(s).  3. To participate and get rewarded in the program, you need to log in to a special bot through your StackOverflow account. The bot will let the TON Foundation team know the wallet addresses of the top authors to reward them. It will be available in the second half of September. Starting now, you may answer and ask questions, and log in to the bot later.  The Toncoin amount will be determined by the position. 1,020 TON will be awarded among the top 10 answers:  1. 300 TON 2. 200 TON 3. 100 TON 4. 90 TON 5. 80 TON 6. 70 TON 7. 60 TON 8. 50 TON 9. 40 TON 10. 30 TON  And 120 TON for the top 3 questions:  1. 60 TON 2. 40 TON 3. 20 TON  Let‚Äôs grow the TON database of knowledge together ü§ó (forwarded from TON Society)

User<59608113>: Hey guys, Tal Kol in his famous article is noting that their team writes tests in TypeScript, rather then fift. This brings me to 2 questions: - Is there any more materials on writing those tests (@talkol was the part 2 ever published? üôè) - What are pros and cons of doing it with TS vs fift?   As far as I understood, in order to test internal command, tests is the only way to run them before deploying to blockchain

talkol: https://society.ton.org/ton-hello-world-guide-for-writing-first-smart-contract-in-func-part-2 (reply to 10505)

talkol: This is part two üëÜ, it also covers all available alternative testing methods, the leading one is toncli - you can see examples of toncli type tests here: https://github.com/disintar/toncli/blob/master/docs/advanced/func_tests_new.md

User<59608113>: Awesome, thank you man!

davide: the first part is ok for beginners that don‚Äôt know anything about TON developing? (reply to 10506)

talkol: Yes, it‚Äôs a beginner post (reply to 10509)

davide: thank you (reply to 10510)

talkol: If there‚Äôs anything unclear let me know and I‚Äôll fix

User<59608113>: Honestly - the first part didnt get me into programming my first smart contract, maybe just because of the way my programming mind works - when i start with something new, i want to see full cycle from 0 to deployed code.  However, it got me lot's of general understanding of how TON smartcontracts work.  I ended up with hands-on coding while following this set of tutorials mentioned in official documentation: https://github.com/romanovichim/TonFunClessons_Eng (reply to 10509)

User<59608113>: Hey guys, I've recorded a video for those who want to make the first steps https://youtu.be/RbIt8bjvvjE In this video, i show resources that helped me to start and go through the first tutorial of the list of lessons I've shared (reply to 10513)

TON technical overview: The recently announced TON Enhancement Proposals system has already attracted the attention of many developers in the ecosystem. We invite you to suggest your improvements and join the discussion of current proposals: TEP83 - FunC (or wider) project configuration file format TEP85 - Soul bound token - NFTs owned by keypair rather then by address TEP86 - Semi-fungible tokens(SFT) - Mix of NFTs and Jettons

·Ö†: Anyone have the way to calculate the chances of 1. the same word appearing twice anywhere in any random 24 secret words, and 2. the same word appearing twice in direct sequence (at any position, but consequtively) within the random 24 secret words? It'd be very interesting to know. When testing wallets extensively over the past 6 months, i've seen 1. a few times, and 2. once. I don't know how many total mnemonics there are, if we know that, maybe someone knows how to calculate.

Andrey: 2048 words total (reply to 10530)

·Ö†: Mathematicians! What formula would we use to calculate possibility 1 and 2? (reply to 10530)

Daniil: The probability of certain word to appear in passphrase is 24/2048 (24 is count of words in passphrase and 2048 is all words count) which is ~1.17% The probability of 2 certain words to appear in passphrase in any place is 24/2048 * 23/2048 which is ~0.013% (reply to 10532)

Daniil: So there is nothing incredible that you saw this:)

Slava: You can run the real mnemonic generation algorithm and just measure how often this will happen. This will give you real life results. (reply to 10532)

·Ö†: The probability of the two same words appearing CONSECUTIVELY?

·Ö†: I mean statistically. The same word twice one after the other. There will be a formula to calculate that probability. It will be a lot less again.  Perhaps Daniil can provide. My mathematics is unfortunately very rusty! (reply to 10535)

Daniil: I'm not sure if there any restrictions about same words appearing, but if there are NO any restrictions in code, the probability will be 23/2048 = ~1.12% (reply to 10536)

·Ö†: No the same words can appear and I‚Äôve seen it few times in manual testing. But the same word directly after one another for example in position 12 and 13 you have ‚Äúrice‚Äù not in a position with some other word in between. How would you calculate that? Or were you saying that‚Äôs 0.013% in which case I misunderstood the previous answer. (reply to 10538)

Slava: There are no restrictions, each word is selected randomly. (reply to 10538)

·Ö†: Yes in theory there could be 24 same words the same and that would be one in trillions I guess. But just twice in succession would be good to know as it‚Äôs still quite rare and a young enthusiastic newcomer to Ton has such a situation. Nice to tell him exactly how lucky he is. )) (reply to 10540)

Daniil: Probability is ~1.12% for two same words to appear in adjacent positions  Probability is ~0.013% is when you say IN THE NEXT RANDOMLY GENERATED MNEMONIC THERE WILL BE TWO WORDS: A and B (in any positions) (reply to 10539)

Slava: The thing is that not every mnemonic will satisfy the additional conditions, so the probability will be lower I guess.

·Ö†: I don‚Äôt think so. 1.12% is probability of any single word appearing anywhere. But the same word appearing twice adjacent to each other in the same wallet that‚Äôs not 0.013% I don‚Äôt think but never mind it‚Äôs a bit off topic and not of any security importance of course. (reply to 10542)

–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª: as i know the last word is a checksum, so it is not choosen idependently from others, that why it is hard to count the precise probability

·Ö†: That would make good sense. Still we could get an approximation then perhaps ruling out one place and counting 23 available slots and then the probability of being adjacent. (reply to 10545)

Slava: If you roll two fair six-sided dice, what is the probability that the dice show the same number? https://www.cuemath.com/questions/if-you-roll-two-fair-six-sided-dice-what-is-the-probability-that-the-dice-show-the-same-number/

·Ö†: Yes this would be the correct way to calculate based on a 23 sided dice.  Well done! (reply to 10547)

Slava: 2048 sided dice :)

·Ö†: Yes I just realized hahaha indeed (reply to 10549)

·Ö†: I don‚Äôt want to physically try üòÇ

Slava: So the probability will be 1/2048 = 0.048%

Slava: Not considering the fact that additional conditions take place.

·Ö†: Easy when you think about it! Thank you!

Matthew: This is the probability that 2 adjacent words in a list of 24 words will be the same? (reply to 10552)

Matthew: Aren‚Äôt the two 2048-sided dice rolled like‚Ä¶ 24 times or something like this?

Slava: This is true for Ethereum but not for TON. (reply to 10545)

Slava: Not quite, it's a probability that two words will be the same. I'm not sure how to extrapolate this considering that we have 24 words :) (reply to 10555)

Matthew: Ahhhh ok so it sounds like you‚Äôre talking about scenario 1

Matthew: Not scenario 2

Matthew: Ok but this is not the equivalent scenario. In that case we are rolling 2 dice. In our scenario, we‚Äôre rolling 24 dice. Unless I‚Äôm misunderstanding (reply to 10547)

Slava: No, you are right. (reply to 10561)

User<5111862779>: Can a contract running in TVM call a C Library? Are C libraries accessible within FunC or not?

·Ö†: I thought we are rolling one dice with 2,048 sides, and we are looking for the same number twice in a row. So, we can say any number, even number 1000, and what is the probability of 1000 being rolled on the next roll, it is 1 in 2,048? So I thought it is this simple ))

Matthew: I‚Äôm going to very cautiously submit this as maybe my best guess for what the probability of 2 words in a list of 24 words will be the same, assuming each word is sampled from a list of 2,048 words haha (https://www.omnicalculator.com/statistics/dice)

Matthew: maybe there‚Äôs another calculator here https://www.omnicalculator.com/statistics that can be used to figure out the probability for scenario 2

·Ö†: Wow, so now i wonder which way it the dice being rolled for our 24 words? üòÇ (reply to 10565)

·Ö†: You make a very interesting point Matt, I did not think that correctly I think üòÇthink think

–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª: So every word is generated independently, but some mnemonics are considered invalid. I think we can assume, that probability of A is nearly same on set of all mnemonics, and set of valid mnemonics.  Then i suggest the following answers:    1. 1 - (2048*2047*...*2025)/2048^24  2. 1 - (2048*2047^23)/2048^24

Matthew: yes, but if you don‚Äôt get 1000 on the next roll, you have another chance to roll again. and you can do this 23 times in total (reply to 10564)

·Ö†: Yes for scenario 1 (same word twice in the 23 words) but for scenario 2 you can only roll it once. (reply to 10570)

Matthew: ah ok so we‚Äôre talking about scenario 2?

·Ö†: yes

Matthew: ok well‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt you still have like 24 chances to get 2 words in a row to be the same?

Matthew: (it‚Äôs not exactly 24 i don‚Äôt think, but it‚Äôs a number larger than 10 for sure from what i think‚Ä¶. haha)

·Ö†: 2,048 words, and you want same word twice in a row, seemed it should be 1/2048 but you threw a different light on things

Matthew: you want the same word twice in a row in a list that has 23 pairs or something like this

·Ö†: yes exactly

·Ö†: 23 single words, not pairs

Matthew: so is the probability like‚Ä¶. 1/2048 * 23 or something like this?

·Ö†: each time probability is 1 in 2048

Matthew: you have 23 chances to get 2 words in a row to be the same

Matthew: (don‚Äôt quote me on 23, it might be slightly off from 23 haha)

·Ö†: that's true yes

Slava: Looks like it ) (reply to 10580)

·Ö†: yes i think we can agree on that 1/2048 * 22 even, since now one slot was consumed.

Matthew: statistics and probability man. üòÇ i‚Äôm glad i never had to take that class lol

Matthew: don‚Äôt include me in the list of people who agree. i‚Äôm not confident enough in my ability with statistics lol (reply to 10586)

·Ö†: i love it, my life shows so many times that it cannot all be about statistics and probabilities üòÇ

Slava: * 23 (there are 24 words in total) (reply to 10586)

–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª: No, because you count mnemonics where are two same words, and after them again two same words twice (reply to 10580)

–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª: still the error should not be big

·Ö†: I'm confident enough in my recklessness lol as it was just an academic interest as i helped a kid create a wallet and never saw it yet twice consecutively, so wondered how rare it is, i have seen same word twice maybe 3 times in 50, which isn't scientific)) (reply to 10588)

·Ö†: no, just two same words adjacent, out of 24 total words minus 1 assuming it is for CRC check (reply to 10591)

Slava: Are we talking about TON or Ethereum? ) (reply to 10594)

·Ö†: TON

Slava: All 24 words in TON are random.

–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic/blob/master/src/functions/generate-mnemonic.ts

·Ö†: oh i see

·Ö†: just someone mentioned check sum so fine 24, makes it easier ))

·Ö†: Please explain this )) (reply to 10595)

Slava: This is the real life generations. The first column is a number of times two consecutive words were generated, second column is a total number of generations and the last one is probability. (reply to 10602)

Slava: So in real life this is ~1% chance for TON.

Slava: That's for Ethereum. (reply to 10601)

Slava: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#generating-the-mnemonic (reply to 10605)

·Ö†: So Daniil answer was right after all üëè (reply to 10604)

Slava: Yep, it's 23 * 1/2048.

·Ö†: 100% logical, after all that )) (reply to 10608)

Slava: Not considering the additional conditions of course.

·Ö†: and real life ))

·Ö†: so ~ 23 * 1/2048 looks good!

Matthew: ^ for scenario 2, to be clear, ya?

·Ö†: yes, scenario 2.

Slava: Yeah, a good practical introduction to the probability theory. I should've studied it better in my student years :) (reply to 10609)

Slava: By the way I can't generate the three consecutive words :)

·Ö†: for scenario one, hmm... now i'm confused again Matt. 1. any of 2,048 words appearing twice anywhere among 24 words, and 2. any of 2,048 words appearing twice in direct succession. You destroyed my clear vision again ))

·Ö†: haha that's nice to know, must be very difficult

Slava: And I'm using 4 cores :) (reply to 10616)

·Ö†: so we know if we see 3 words in a row, that's very very very rare!!!! and highly unlikely to see lol

Matthew: yaaaaaaa haha lol. not sure about scenario 1 yet either (reply to 10617)

·Ö†: now i'm not either sadly, brain isn't in good shape at this AGE and late in the evening ))

Matthew: üòõ

·Ö†: Slava opened my eyes and i saw it CLEARLY now you threw doubt again üòÇ

·Ö†: so i'll tell the kid, please DYOR!!! üòÇ

Dario: No, you cant (reply to 10563)

User<5111862779>: Ok, I thought it was unlikely. Good to know for sure.

·Ö†: There's a non-english word among the 2,048! Naughty, naughty! ... ))

Slava: What word? (reply to 10628)

·Ö†: satoshi ))

Matthew: I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs only 2,048 words

Matthew: Why that set?

·Ö†: Yes, I remember a discussion about it on github I think it was, there's a reason it is considered a secure enough range. But, why that set? I wonder too and how it was arrived at. As, it should have been possible to make it a little better, so that never more than the first three letters are required to differentiate. I see some words a little too similar so that an english speaker may make a mistake, i think, not sure, perhaps one such pair is anger and angry.

Slava: Hah, funny ) (reply to 10630)

Slava: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki#wordlist (reply to 10633)

·Ö†: yes, 4 letters is right perhaps it is not possible to get 2048 words with only 3.

Daniel: There are plenty of articles out there about the chances of compromising a seed phrase via keyword duplication. The fact of the matter is, as you have noted that the number of options is very limited - this is due to the BEP39 open source wordlist function (or similar) and despite what you may think, word / phrase duplication and the ability to bruteforce is very real. I've actually brute forced a BEP39 seed phrase by accident ffs. If by convention you think of how huge the likes of Rockyou and the dirb lists are and the continued success rate of those, it's less probability you need to be worried about in terms of seed phrase security and more about direct targeting vectors. Think about the probability of a hash collision in anything below SHA256.....really low but still happens and can still be manufactured. I have encountered some APTs now able to manufacture hash collisions in some algorithms which I thought was absolutely impossible. Seems not. I think there is a lot to be said for the improvement of how crytpo assets are secured and I am always thinking and considering new ways to improve cryptographic security functions. I think there is a lot to be said for the way that Solana have introduced state proofs into their cross chain protocols (on the Sol side) which bears equivalence to quantum encryption in some aspects of the mechanism which is pretty cool. Anyway, I'd be really up for working on tweaking and playing with security mechanisms for the TON ecosystem if anyone else is interested.

Emerson: Hi all

Matthew: Hey there mate. Cool to see ya here.   Lexi and I have spoken a little bit in the general community chat and he‚Äôs had a really cool interest in some of the software of ton and the stuff behind the scenes so I thought this place could be cool for him to be a part of too

Emerson: I've got a few questions - How does the vertical blockchain work exactly? I understand it figuratively but not technically. Do you pay an initial gas fee as an extra aside from your message or is it deducted from the message's balance? What happens if you just send BTC if that is even possible, is a little bit converted as a fee? What if you send an empty message, how is the fee received then?

Matthew: Does vertical blockchain refer to infinite sharding or?

Daniel: Hi Matt, vertical blockchain scaling refers to the expansion of a network by adding more power and memory to a system and its core processing unit

Daniel: That's taken verbatim from a description but couldn't think of a way to put it better haha

Emerson: yes im trying to put it into words now

Daniel: Horizontal is essentially adding nodes instead

Daniel: Just different methods of scaling

Matthew: Oh, so it‚Äôs not any different than scaling horizontally or vertically in regular server infrastructure then. Wonder why it includes the word blockchain then haha

Emerson: It is in the case of a wrong block being signed, you can rollback and go again from the mistake onwards, whilst youd have to fork if it was horizontal

Emerson: Unsure whether this is also the case for regular server infrastructure

Matthew: Why would it be? There‚Äôs no blocks in the case of regular servers. I‚Äôm a bit confused and this question might help me understand better what you mean more generally (reply to 10651)

Emerson: i was just thinking maybe there is an equivalent case where vertical scaling is superior, there are no blocks ofc (reply to 10652)

Emerson: This bit of the whitepaper is not clear to me

Emerson: The TON Blockchain solves this problem by making each  block  of each shardchain and of the masterchain ( horizontal blockchains ) a small blockchain ( vertical blockchain ) by itself, containing different versions of this  block , or their  differences . Normally, the vertical blockchain consists of exactly one block, and the shardchain looks like a classical blockchain. However, once the invalidity of a block is confirmed and committed into a masterchain block, the  vertical blockchain  of the invalid block is allowed to grow by a new block in the vertical direction, replacing or editing the invalid block. The new block is generated by the current validator subset for the shardchain in question.

Emerson: better formatting

Matthew: Ahhhhh ok so I‚Äôm not sure if vertical blockchain is the same thing as vertical blockchain scaling. Cause when we google vertical blockchain scaling it mentions what Daniel found. But yes that‚Äôs what I thought, I vaguely recalled the term vertical blockchain being used in the white paper to refer to infinite sharping

Emerson: Yes youre right

Emerson: although im not sure it is the same as infinite sharding because that just refers to the shardchains and this involves chains being layered

Matthew: So my very loose answer is like‚Ä¶.. in a more traditional blockchain like ethereum all the data is stored in one block so to speak. Whereas in ton, you can ‚Äúcompress‚Äù all that data into one hash number maybe (don‚Äôt quote me on that, I don‚Äôt know the specifics but for the sake of the analogy), and store that hash in the parent blockchain, and store the actual specifics of the data in a child blockchain

Matthew: So the parent / master blockchain makes sure all the data has integrity, but at the same time doesn‚Äôt need to worry about storing all the data in the world

Matthew: And then the team of blockchain servers can split up their duties of which shardchains they take care of and store on their own computer

Matthew: So in essence, each node in the network takes care of a fraction of the whole blockchain, rather than all of it

Matthew: ^ my attempt at an answer anyways haha

Emerson: yes that's the where the shardchain validators keep track of their own shardchain as well as neighbouring ones  (those one hexadecimal apart re the shard identifiers)

Emerson: youre right

Emerson: but i do not see where the vertical blockchain comes in, this specifically implies "grow by a new block in the vertical direction" and i am confused as to how that works in particular

Matthew: Hm what are you wondering about exactly then? Like what in particular?

Matthew: Like the actual details and specifics of what that means in practice?

Matthew: Ya ok I can see your original question was how does that exactly work. Ok so maybe I don‚Äôt have any info to offer you that‚Äôs useful lol (reply to 10642)

Emerson: the TON Blockchain solves this problem by making each  block  of each shardchain and of the masterchain ( horizontal blockchains ) a small blockchain ( vertical blockchain ) by itself, containing different versions of this  block (reply to 10671)

Emerson: i mean this

Emerson: it seems like a very complicated thing to execute in practice

Matthew: Completely agreed, but a v core part of why ton why will be more scalable from what I can see (reply to 10675)

Emerson: yes exactly which makes it so important to the project

Emerson: its one of the things ive highlighted as being most unique

Emerson: alongside what you said above about infinite sharding

Matthew: Agreed (reply to 10678)

Matthew: To me I understood vertical blockchain to be the same thing as infinite sharding. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong?

Emerson: i think it is different. infinite sharding refers to shardchains being created/merged when load becomes too high/low vertical blockchain refers to each chain being its own small chain which can trace back in time to correct mistakes

Emerson: i may be wrong however i have only been looking at this since friday

Daniel: Hmmm, think I'm gonna need to read the Whitepaper on this aspect haha. I don't understand the terminology 'mistake'. Where / how is this mistake induced? And more importantly, can this functionality be exploited maliciously.

Emerson: the mistake refers to an invalid shardchain block being found

Matthew: Ok! Interesting. Really good to know. When I read that it just sounded like infinite sharding to me. I haven‚Äôt made my way through much of section 2 yet, I‚Äôve left it for last haha, I‚Äôve looked at a couple other sections (reply to 10682)

Emerson: haha ive gone through 2 and nothing else

Emerson: going through 3 now

Daniel: Ok, it's an interesting concept all round then....especially with the infinite sharding ambiguity. Might spend the week trying to hack it :) (reply to 10685)

Emerson: nice :)

Matthew: ok so i just read the section that you‚Äôre asking about (2.1.17 correcting invalid shardchain blocks). i guess i sort of understand it to be like‚Ä¶ creating a new version of a block ‚Ä¶ and overwriting the previous version of the block. and this is somehow able to propogate across the network even though the new blocks after the now edited block may have pointed at the old version of that block.

Matthew: does that sound about right?

Daniel: Ah ok, that does make more sense then. Gives me a little more to play with for sure, thanks Matt

Slava: Vertical Blockchain is a means to correct older blocks while infinite sharding is all about network scalability (the concept is very similar to traditional servers).

Matthew: ya. the mental analogy i have in my head right now about vertical blockchain is sort of like macos time machine haha (with one document basically representing one block)

Emerson: yes thats right although it is not overwriting but instead creating a new one which is used instead (the vertical aspect) (reply to 10692)

Matthew: Ah yes. Right. I was being cheap and quick with my use of the word overwriting (reply to 10696)

Matthew: Overwriting in terms of effect, not implementation

Emerson: yep makes sense

Emerson: never seen this sort of idea before though

Matthew: Ya, and so going back to your v original question, are you wondering about like the specific implementation details of this? And what it means in terms of repercussions for the engineering design required for the blockchain?

Matthew: Seems the logic of the validators is gonna have to be more sophisticated to handle this

Emerson: now i think weve hashed it out more it makes more sense to me

Matthew: Ah ok cool!!!

Emerson: but yes, gl to the validators if/when this happens lol

Matthew: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòõüòõüòõüòõ (reply to 10705)

‚Äî 2022-09-05 ‚Äî

Emerson: Could someone explain how the on and off chain connection works exactly? Like how does the ton blockchain and ton network connect? or how does a ton blockchain smart contract retrieve an off chain file from ton storage?

Emerson: Matt this might be more up your alley, chapter 4 :)

Matthew: sh@t. the chapter i‚Äôve read the least that is not chapter 2 lol üòú

Emerson: haha sorry

Matthew: without taking a closer look right now, i believe the ton network is just a way for all the computers within the network to be able to communicate with each other more effectively. and that more effective communication method then can be in turn used to orchestrate everything that needs to be done for the blockchain. so basically, again without taking a closer look, a better designed p2p network protocol for the blockchain use-case.

Matthew: (versus say, using the http network protocol, which is actually a server-client protocol, rather than p2p)

Emerson: yes i see what you mean! makes sense thanks

Matthew: as for the ton storage, not sure if this will answer your question, but basically the ton blockchain will keep track of a bunch of meta data associated with the files, but not actually keep track of the actual contents of the file. but included in that meta data will also be a hash of the contents of the file (not sure how familiar you might be with hashes), but basically that hash will be able to tell the downloader of teh file whether they have the actual correct contents or not. that way, the ton storage computers not a part of the blockchain network can just send you the file, and the blockchain can confirm for you if you have the correct file, and the blockchain doesn‚Äôt have to worry about actually storing the data in their blockchain

Matthew: (from 4.1.7 "An example of such a service is given by TON Storage. In its simplest form, it allows users to store fles off-chain, by keeping on-chain only a hash of the fle to be stored, and possibly a smart contract where some other parties agree to keep the fle in question for a given period of time for a pre-negotiated fee.‚Äù)

Emerson: makes perfect sense, thanks so much Matt

Matthew: an analogy might be like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. warehouses outside the city. stores inside the city. and corporate headquarters. a store wants to ‚Äúdownload‚Äù an item, asks headquarters if it‚Äôs in stock anywhere, headquarters tells them that teh item is in stock at this warehouse, and then the store goes to that warehouse to get the item. all the itmes are stored ‚Äúoff-chain‚Äù outside of the city

Emerson: great analogy

Matthew: awesome!!! üòÅ

Matthew: (and headquarters is the blockchain, the entity with the authortative record)

Emerson: and the chain:)

Matthew: Yes haha üòÅ

Matthew: i highly recommend this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE maybe it doesn‚Äôt suit your style of learning or style of communication etc etc but will share anyways in the small event it does

Emerson: thanks Matt

Matthew: it‚Äôs about bitcoin specifically, especially cause the video was made back in 2013 lol, but it does offer a much better sense of what exactly blockchain technology is and what it has to offer

Emerson: if you have any questions about ch2 lmk

Matthew: will do!! ty!

Daniel: Nice Matt. Not being familiar with this FunC lang yet (seems really abstract.....what's wrong with Rust ffs haha). To that end, are you familiar with how the hash mapping functionality works in the TON smart contracts in terms of locating block data? (reply to 10714)

Dario: Hi guys, im getting this error while reading config param inside an inline function. I dont understand why sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesnt. This is the error:   error while running VM: error while parsing a dictionary node label  i got that it doesnt load the procedure, but why?

Daniel: Hmmmm, not sure

Daniel: I'm still having issues installing TON CLi

Andrey: Did you try docker? (reply to 10733)

Daniel: I didn't yet no. Tried using npm and also cloning the repo, but guess Docker is the next option. Trying to load everything into the new blockchain sec / dev VM so just working my way through what is and isn't in there already too.

Daniel: Thanks though man, I'll try Docker now

Andrey: An ultimate setup is:  1. Remove prev versions (rm -rf ~/.config/toncli) if linux 2. Clone master git clone https://github.com/disintar/toncli.git 3. cd toncli & pip install -e .  If you didn't install SpyCheese binaries - you need to get them from toncli-local branch here: https://github.com/SpyCheese/ton/tree/toncli-local if you want to work with new tests. Soon all binaries will be auto integrated into toncli  Or just use docker: https://github.com/Trinketer22/func_docker

Daniel: Awesome thank you for that. Will give it a go. Yeah using Linux so will give both options a go thank you (reply to 10737)

Professor: Looking for some work opportunities   Expertise in  C/C++/Python and Kubernetes with microservice framework gRPC and protobuf

Professor: I really dont know where to start ü´¢

Slava: There are a lot of opportunities in TON. Start by studying the technology, investigate the ecosystem, find some weak spots and offer your solution.

Daniel: Yeah, I'm really making the most of discovering TON. Really unique blockchain and ecosystem.....if not a little complex in some areas. Interesting security aspects too especially regrading exploits in memory

Daniel: I'm enjoying exploring TON a lot

Dario: I noticed that loading Network configuration from a base64 string takes a few seconds. I dont think its a good idea to add it by default, but maybe a built in method to apply it easily is enough (reply to 10763)

Dario: Well we will see

User<59608113>: Guys, which major TON development players do you know? Ex. TonWhales etc.  I'm looking into changing my career path, so searching for a company where I could start working part-time providing classic development services (I'm a senior in Angular, React, React Native, NodeJS, and Telegram bot development) while learning TON smart contracts programming from colleagues.

TON technical overview: You can check https://jobs.ton.org/jobs (reply to 10766)

User<59608113>: Thank you!

Matthew: Good luck! I may or may not do something similar someday too, I‚Äôm not sure yet (reply to 10766)

User<59608113>: Did anybody find this video useful after watching it?  Not promoting, just seriously planning to record more videos on what I learn in TON smartcontract development.  Some feedback would be really appreciated. Thanks (reply to 10517)

Matthew: i haven‚Äôt gotten around to watching it myself. it looks really really really well made tho

Matthew: if i do delve more into func i might start off by, like you, following along with the tonfunclessons. it‚Äôs not very often i learn from videos, i‚Äôm more of a reader

Step: currently only 1 shard in master chain?  when will TON have more shards?

Slava: This depends on the network activity. (reply to 10773)

Step: have we ever had additional shard since genesis block? (reply to 10774)

talkol: The way I understand it from the white papers, sharding is an automatic mechanism that takes place as load increases. When the load on the single shard is too big for handling on a single machine effectively, it will be split in two. Why would this matter to you? It‚Äôs an internal detail that is abstracted away from users (reply to 10773)

Tim: Yes (reply to 10775)

Emerson: Hi, could anyone explain about shard vs account chains? dont quite get the difference, and what makes account chains virtual. thanks

Emerson: how do you see this? (reply to 10773)

Emerson: shardchains contain groups of account chains which contain accounts? soemthing doesnt seem right (reply to 10778)

Slava: Each shard contains a group of accounts. Imagine that you have a dedicated shard for each account ‚Äî this is called "account-chain". However, this is just a thought experiment therefore it is "virtual".

Slava: The main idea is that: 1. you shouldn't expect two accounts to be "living" in the same shard, 2. it shows the incredible scalability of the TON network.

Step: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getMasterchainInfo   always single shard "shard":"-9223372036854775808" (reply to 10779)

talkol: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73448894/ton-supports-multiple-workchains-which-one-should-i-use-in-my-code  I wrote this answer in SO about workchains and shardchains, but it was aggressively closed üòÖ

talkol: (closed by SO moderators, not by somebody in ton community)

TON technical overview: For this block of masterchain, https://explorer.toncenter.com/search?workchain=-1&shard=8000000000000000&seqno=3063410 there were 12 shards in basechain (there were intensive tests which caused chain split). (reply to 10783)

TON technical overview: Currently, except for short periods of high workload, TON processes around 1-3 TPS, which is well below the maximum workload that a single shard can handle: so there is no reason to split the chain.

Emerson: why shouldnt I? didnt you say shards contain a group of accounts, so i do expect 2+ accounts? (reply to 10782)

Emerson: but it is better to think of it as each account having its own chain for the vertical blockchain aspect?

Emerson: did i get that right?

Emerson: thanks! (reply to 10783)

Emerson: right so workchain -1 is the master chain, and there is one shard -922... and as the first shard and workchain synonymous that means there is nothing except the masterchain right now? (reply to 10783)

TON technical overview: Currently we have one masterchain and one basechain. Masterchain never splits to shards. All activity happens in basechain though which can split to shards. In example above there was one chain in masterchain (as always) and 12 in basechain (reply to 10792)

Emerson: got it, basechain being Workchain Zero?

TON technical overview: Yes (reply to 10794)

Emerson: thanks!

Emerson: :D

Emerson: does someone know how how the fall-back keys work? dont understand how having an extra 32 bit integer field prevents key retention attacks

Matthew: Which section is this?

Emerson: 3.2.11

Emerson: hey matt

Matthew: Hey there!!! Haha

Matthew: hm. just gave it a read. what exactly does it mean by a key retention attack? now that‚Äôs a q i have for you lol

Emerson: i know this i know this... give mea min

Daniel: I'm guessing you're referring to a key recovery attack and the measure being referenced is a counter exhaustive key search attack. But this attack is a little outdated due to a 32 bit key space being included to avoid the vulnerability. Think this might be a little bit of showboating by the author tbh

Emerson: i think the reference is to the 32 bit key having that exact purpose

Daniel: yeah

Daniel: It's not much of a vuln these days but still worthwhile being aware of for sure

Daniel: That being said....

Daniel: I'm reading a lot about sustained BGP attacks on DeFi and Web3 applications which is worrying af

Daniel: So nothing is insignificant it seems

X: Hi is there a WTON available?

Emerson: i think in this case as neighboring nodes also confirm activity so they can manipulate the values of a node they all surround...? (reply to 10804)

Emerson: whats a BGP attack

Daniel: Using BGP and false SSL certs etc to spoof an application into revealing cryptographically secure information and allowing the extraction of data

Emerson: i see okay

Matthew: i just found this btw Lexi. you‚Äôve asked about fees before iirc. https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/blob/1e7312d94e1f3b6b1e77a202f2d5687fc95ec1ce/articles/how_does_the_fee_count.md it‚Äôs an article that‚Äôs not published yet I think https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/pull/27

Emerson: yes that was my original question in the community chat thanks!

Matthew: cool!!!!

Emerson: sorry for the basic quesiton, but what is the difference between the abstract datagram network layer and overlay networks?

‚Äî 2022-09-06 ‚Äî

Slava: An overlay network works on top of the ADNL. It's like HTTP working on top of the TCP. I would suggest to look into the OSI model for better understanding of the network stack and layered protocol architecture.

A: Hello, is there a reason why TON wallets have an activation fee?

User<59608113>: If i'm not mistaken - its related to the fact that on TON blockchain evry wallet is a smartcontract Meanwhile, deploying a smartcontract to a blockhain costs :) (reply to 10829)

talkol: Where do you notice any significant fee? The wallet smart contract deployment takes place on your first outgoing transaction. It‚Äôs very small (cents) and can be considered part of the outgoing gas cost so it‚Äôs fairly normal (reply to 10829)

O: Hello,  Do you have any ideas is that possible to organize some kind of eth‚Äôs Gas Station Network on TON?  The main idea - to pay commission with  non-ton token to some relay, who will add gas/ton to the transaction and send to network

Arjun: What platform is TON Network used on?

altoshi: TON is independent blockchain (reply to 10835)

Arjun: Discord    telegram  Twitter   YouTube (reply to 10836)

Alex: https://ton.org/community (reply to 10837)

talkol: Where did you say a killer use case for Eth Gas Station on Ethereum? (reply to 10833)

Dario: yes, you can build a smart contract to let users pays gas in jettons, for example. you can start reading wallet contracts (reply to 10833)

O: Thanks! But are there any examples - would be great to have some git links (reply to 10841)

Roman: Hey Matt, you found a diamond for newbies!  I tried to adopt this article to documentation style, and here is what we received:  https://www.tonspace.co/develop/smart-contracts/fees  While low-level information about fees still exists in Low Level section:  https://www.tonspace.co/develop/howto/fees_low_level (reply to 10820)

Dmitry: You need to have some initial amount of toncoin to pay for jetton transfer anyway. (reply to 10841)

Dario: yeah mine was just an idea to work with external messages and jettons. You need someone to pay for contract initialization etc (reply to 10844)

Emerson: If there is an eth workchain how easy would it be to get my nfts from eth to ton? would it be seamless or as complicated as solana?

Andrey: üëãüèª, check out our little improvement of TVM Debug OP. Guess it's really needed feature for Func developers :)  BTW with toncli new tests it works awesome.  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/452

talkol: oh that's sweet! I looked for strdump! (reply to 10849)

talkol: hope it gets merged, debugging by printing numbers is tiresome :)

Emerson: How big is a TON block

Andrey: By what count? (reply to 10853)

Emerson: i mean bytes

Emerson: like how big is each masterchain block? i assume small since it uses merkle proofs and it doesnt even matter?

Emerson: also are there any bridges? how do i bring my eth onto TON?

Andy: There is a bridge: ton.org/bridge (reply to 10857)

User<609186178>: Hi!I have a problem with my wallet.What do I need to do for solved the problem?

Slava: Are you trying to view the old transactions? This is a known issue and you probably won't be able to do anything about that. Try reloading the wallet though. (reply to 10867)

Slava: Sorry, this chat is for English speakers only.

·Ö†: Yes usually one or more re-starts of the wallet solves the problem. It doesn't affect functionality, just means old historic items won't be in the list if it is important to see all items, restart it. or look in an explorer. (reply to 10868)

User<5111862779>: What is involved in adding a service to the TON ecosystem? Is there a checklist of things for th√≠s service? Where would it need to run? And how about usage of storage or filesystems?

Emerson: thanks (reply to 10861)

Emerson: i was wondering about infra... (reply to 10862)

Emerson: nice!! (reply to 10864)

Emerson: Never heard of orbs before

Emerson: Isnt it very dangerous to have a mutable smart contracts? what if smoeone relies on it and suddenly it changes and messes everything up?

Matthew: That‚Äôs why you gotta make changes carefully haha. I think I read in the white paper that in ethereum they‚Äôre not mutable, but developers found a workaround anyways so that they can release updates to their contracts

Emerson: yes theres a backdoor they leave for upgrades, also incredibly dangerous but not everyone does this - some make contracts on top etc and it works. yes they need to be done carefully but what if a mistake it made , then big problem will occur

Matthew: I guess there‚Äôs no right or wrong answer, it‚Äôs about trade offs and what you want to optimize for

Emerson: i really dont like this haha

Emerson: there should be a way, if a contract is updated, all constant txs to be automatically stopped pending re approval

Matthew: So like prompting a user for an update instead of doing it automatically, like iOS updates for example (they can be automatic or manual)

Matthew: Is there a way to point at a specific version of a smart contract? Or when you call one, does it always go to the latest version?

Emerson: think it goes to the latest version as otherwise you need to pay more fees to the validators

Emerson: and interestingly every  global smart contract will have to modify every local version of it, making this difficult accross workchains in case the language is different for example

Matthew: Hmmmmmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm attempting to understand this properly rn ü§îü§î (reply to 10888)

Emerson: yeah interesting isnt it

Matthew: What do you mean every local version?

Emerson: well global smart contracts need an iteration of themselves on every shardchain right?

Emerson: otherwise they exist on one shard and thats it

Matthew: So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a time interval when two or more versions of a smart contract could exist in the whole blockchain at once?

Emerson: yes

Emerson: its possible but unlikely

Emerson: "However, some  high-load  smart contracts may want to have an  instance  in each shardchain of some workchain. To achieve this, they must propagate their creating transaction into all shardchains, for instance, by committing this transaction into the  root  shardchain (w, ‚àÖ) 11 of the workchain w and paying a large commission.12"

Matthew: Hmmmm. Ok but like‚Ä¶.. two different versions of one smart contract aren‚Äôt going to be called for the same action / operation I don‚Äôt think

Emerson: oh no i agree

Emerson: dont think its an issue

Emerson: the changing of the contract is much more so

Matthew: Right ok gotcha haha

Emerson: so i understand it correctly right? an sc developer can just modify a smart contract and send all the tokens to themselves e.g.?

Emerson: technically possible?

Matthew: Hm good question ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î

Emerson: @slavafomin is this right?

Tim: Not every smart contract (reply to 10903)

Emerson: Well those which have the option right, I understand you can have / not have this feature

Tim: Right. Like in any other chain

Justin: there will be projects in the future (community-led, foundation approved) which help to protect the community. example: https://jetton.live/ other things in the roadmap include minter type site whereby users can input to check immutability, etc. (reply to 10908)

Hamza: I don‚Äôt remember my 24 secret words how i can open my account

Proton: you can't (reply to 10931)

talkol: Using a non-custodial wallet means that you‚Äôre responsible for remembering the secret words. Nobody else has them in order to protect you from theft. The downside is that if you lose the secret, nobody else has them to help you recover. This is not specific to TON, every non-custodial wallet in crypto works this way

defuera: And this is why industry investing heavily in such technologies as social recovery :)

talkol: Write it on a piece of paper and put it in a safety deposit box

talkol: :)

defuera: put it in ur bank üòú

altoshi: You guys writing it on a paper? I‚Äôm just screenshotin it (reply to 10935)

talkol: Screenshots end up in iCloud drives

altoshi: But if Wallet is important, I‚Äôm writing it on a paper haha (reply to 10943)

talkol: Also ideally there should be a mnemonic (24 words) and a passphrase and you would use both to generate the wallet (I don‚Äôt think any of the wallets currently support this but not hard to support). And then the best practice is that the paper only holds the 24 words and the passphrase somewhere else like your password manager (where you store your bank password)

talkol: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb-mnemonic/blob/master/src/functions/mnemonic-to-key-pair.ts#L13  This function supports a password (passphrase) in addition to the words and IMO all wallet apps currently pass an empty string

talkol: This same practice is usually done on hardware wallets. The hardware wallet only ‚Äústores‚Äù the 24 words, never the passphrase. So if somebody steals it and hacks the PIN code, still the passphrase is never stored on the device which keeps you safe

·Ö†: Why is that a benefit in your opinion? The 24 are already a very strong protection. Adding a second layer that then prevents access even if you have them (if I understood correctly) would certainly cause more losses than protection. Or you mean as a protection of the wallet access on your phone? If so, yes that option is available on TONkeeper, Tonhub and TonSafe. It doesn‚Äôt prevent you accessing your wallet if you can‚Äôt get into your phone anymore. (reply to 10946)

Andrey: Tonsafe is a clone of tonhub (reply to 10949)

·Ö†: A Cold wallet in my opinion yes it‚Äôs a different use case scenario. Those using cold wallets generally are storing large amounts and will bother to take great care. Many hot wallet users are very cavalier even with their 24 words. (reply to 10948)

Andrey: I guess TonHub licence doesn't allow to create clones in public app stores (reply to 10950)

·Ö†: Very funny. Where did you get that idea? I test both and proven the wrong: https://t.me/TonDever/135?comment=885 (reply to 10950)

Slava: Why don't you store the mnemonic directly in the password manager? (reply to 10946)

Andrey: The tonsafe has more similarities than differences with tonhub. Also it's closed source by Noname team. (reply to 10953)

User<5111862779>: Can someone clarify for me how a third party service could be added to the TON Ecosystem? Is there documentation for this?  I think there are core services that are written by the TON Team like DNS Payments etc, but what about third party services ?

User<5111862779>: I think I read in the whitepaper these would be accessed over TON Networking.  But what other aspects are there to this?

Matthew: Can you name an example of a third party service you‚Äôre thinking of please?

User<5111862779>: I don‚Äôt have a particular one in mind but just a web service for example.  My understanding at the moment is that this service would use existing TON core services.  And that‚Äôs one aspect of it.  Just wondering what else might be involved.

Alex: Perhaps you should to research these examples: * Tonhub connect for 3d party services https://developers.tonhub.com/docs/apps * Tonkeeper connect for 3d party services https://github.com/tonkeeper/ton-connect  Service example https://getgems.io/ which uses both connections.  Also, ton.org has some kind of verification for services on the bottom of page https://ton.app/ (reply to 10956)

talkol: All these core services could be written by anybody else. TON DNS and payment channels are simple smart contracts that you can write yourself (reply to 10956)

talkol: It depends on how much money it‚Äôs holding. For small medium wallets that works just fine (reply to 10954)

talkol: It‚Äôs only for big wallets or paranoid people. But I view it as a form of 2FA. There are two separate secrets during authentication that are stored in two separate places. It‚Äôs true that wallets have FaceID and this is a means of extra authentication but that‚Äôs not part of the protocol. It‚Äôs added external layers like a PIN code on a hardware wallet, with the right equipment you can bypass it. Maybe even an Apple employee can bypass it, who knows. (reply to 10949)

talkol: If you want the most secure way to currently maintain a high worth wallet on TON - I designed this approach: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-offline-transaction  It‚Äôs safer than a hardware wallet IMO. But it‚Äôs only relevant for big wallets in cold storage.

·Ö†: Indeed the mobile phone "protection" is very limited. You could be forced to look at a phone by a thief etc, forced to use your finger, and patterns are easy to break. Pin codes can also be broken indeed, I think the most difficult are the (at least on iPhones) very long alphanumeric passwords. Large amounts should always go into a cold wallet but generally for most of us we're probably ok in general use. 2FA is always a very good idea though! (reply to 10963)

·Ö†: Wow that's beyond impressive! Safer than a hardware cold-storage wallet is amazing, but it is something I considered a risk with a hardware wallet as the device could get damaged etc, so you've provided a better solution, now if only it could be made easy! I'm not a developer (any more, was before this new technology), I couldn't manage that on my own üòÇ (reply to 10964)

·Ö†: Actually you make the steps quite easy to follow. If I had five figures in TON I'd use this, would be worth dedicating a hard drive to it. (reply to 10966)

Daniel: Yup, which is why Solidity is always getting smashed. I found that working with ecosystems that use Rust the best so far. Rust is immutable and memory safe by deafault. I'm surprised more chains don't use it. (reply to 10877)

talkol: tbh I‚Äôm not sure I agree that‚Äôs why Solidity is getting smashed (reply to 10975)

altoshi: Because Ethereum gonna use new virtual machine in 2.0 (reply to 10975)

altoshi: Ethereum WebAssembly Virtual Machine  So people will be able to use Rust, C++, C

Daniel: I mean, I love solidity - I audit EVM contracts every day but the functionality is so stretched and leaky it is just one thing after another

altoshi: EVM is pretty old for crypto sphere haha  EVM is not good for scalability (reply to 10979)

altoshi: A lot of EVM chains like Avalanche , Polygon sometimes getting bugs with gas and speed

Daniel: The new EVM model won't change how the contracts are deployed and exploited unfortunately. I love Avalanche but that isn't doing too well in terms of security right now.

Daniel: Rust is life haha

Daniel: There's a reason MS are rewriting Windows in its entirety in Rust

altoshi: Another reason to learn FunCüòÑ (reply to 10982)

altoshi: I think, in the future many blockchains would use TVM

Rupansh: Hi how do i get tx hash from wallet.methods.transfer.send in tonweb ? I dont see anything in the response that could point me to it

Tim: you dont

Emerson: what is TL like? is it hard to move from rust ?

talkol: The concept of a txhash is a little different in TON because a single transaction you send to a contract can result in multiple txhashes. TON works by sending asynchronous messages between contracts. These messages can even be handled on different blocks. When a contract receives a message, it can send another message as a response, so the first message you sent in your transaction can cause additional "transactions" to be created (reply to 11012)

talkol: It's very different from Ethereum where everything is atomic and synchronous and a single txhash can tell the whole story of whether what you wanted to do succeeded or failed

Andrey: TL is structure definition language like Protobuf (reply to 11015)

User<5111862779>: why does toncli produce files wth extension filename.func ? vs .fc

TON technical overview: Both extensions are fine. .func is more preferable now, because it is much simpler to search such files (a lot of other applications use .fc). (reply to 11021)

User<5111862779>: ok, and are there √≠nstructions on building the func standard library?  I saw how to merge it to produce a smart contract but is there a document on building it and including it in the smart contract?

User<5111862779>: Is there any documentation on receive_internal() method? Where is its required signature defined? is it in the func standard library. I did not see documentation of it there.

Roman: Hello, smart-contract devs üëã   How painful was the setup process of TON binaries (func, fift, lite-client) last time for you? How you resolved the issue? Do you want future devs to use your way?  It was painful for me last time. Compare to other blockchains, it was a bad experience. I want to fix this situation. üëæ  So I've made a TON Footstep for this idea and look for someone to help with the reward. What do you think about a one-line installer solution for any system?  Let we discuss the idea together: https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/38

Rupansh: Well i still need to know the status of a txn(and/or subsequent txns that are created) and read the input of the given txn(perhaps at some backend for some verification). Is there seriously no way to track this? (reply to 11016)

Tim: there's but it requires a lot of code (reply to 11034)

Rupansh: wow

Tim: you need to check every transaction of the account and find one with your exact body, then you need to follow every output message and match txes in recipient addresses by lt

Rupansh: that sounds like extra gymnastics for something trivial, but thanks for your help Tim

Tim: and ofc you do it recursively

Rupansh: i guess i'll have to go that way

Tim: https://tonapi.io/transaction/4c6e8ee2d7fc94cf5b7bb78d2ad2d1086e9c3f7508f5f458c3bb24e1bbcff0be tonapi does that, you can checkout their traces

Tim: yes, it's too much extra for ton, so you probably don't need to do all that and just check that seqno is incremented or your tx present in your wallet (reply to 11038)

Tim: I would also recommend using highload wallet. That way you can send queries in parallel and check that your query id is present.

talkol: I think that the recursive code that loads all transactions that originate from your original transactions and checks the exit code of all of them is a ‚Äúcore‚Äù functionality that all ton libraries will eventually support. It‚Äôs just that this use-case is not yet in high demand so you don‚Äôt see it implemented yet  Most simple TON transfers are just one transaction  Jetton transfers are a bit more

Tim: It's doable to just check all exit codes, but it's very hard to react to them. What do you do if you wanted tx chain with length 7 and it exited on 5

Tim: tonutils-go by the way implemented confirmation of tx minting on blockchain

talkol: Yes, it‚Äôs a bit complicated because possibly just one final notification has failed and the entire flow wasn‚Äôt undone (reply to 11045)

User<5633107531>: hi folks. hey, has anyone had any luck building the wallet-android application from here: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-android ?  i tried to build it a bit ago in Android Studio and the build is erroring out and bailing at: "make: *** No rule to make target `/Users/abcd/wallet-android/app/jni/./ton/crypto/smc-envelope/WalletInterface.cpp', needed by `/Users/abcd/wallet-android/app/build/intermediates/ndkBuild/afatDebug/obj/local/armeabi-v7a/objs-debug/tonlib/./ton/crypto/smc-envelope/WalletInterface.o'.

User<5633107531>: i was just wondering if anyone else has encountered this build error and had a solution. it's possible that i've missed some build steps out and/or the build instructions in the README are a bit out of date. for example, i installed Android Studio 3.5.1 as advised in the README, but Android Studio actually told me that this version was too old for the project.

Emerson: Has the overlay network been built yet?

Emerson: is the osi model the same as the overlay network? (reply to 10828)

Andrey: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model (reply to 11052)

Emerson: im reading this now yes (reply to 11053)

Emerson: but reading with a very basic tech understanding is making ti diffuclt

Emerson: is it similar or not? if i read this article will i undersand hiw the iverlay network works?

User<5633107531>: you'll struggle to understand the technical nature of a p2p overlay network if you're not familiar with foundation network concepts (reply to 11056)

Emerson: and the OSI model is the foundation network concept?

User<5633107531>: the OSI model just defines conceptual layers in a computer system's network stack, basically

Emerson: cheers shaun

Emerson: ill make notes on it and learn it

Emerson: could you explain as if i have read it? so i can read what you say straight after? thanks so much

Amin: Your question is somehow ambiguous. Ask specifically please. Generally speaking we can discuss about two overlays. First ADNL protocol which is an overlay over UDP protocol, that abstracts out the IPv4/IPv6 addresses and ports. Nodes use this protocol to share the states and updates (new blocks) and reach consensus. Each node or generally a participator in ADNL protocol has a 256-bit address which is sha256 hash of it's serialized construction that contains a public key. Other nodes can encrypt the messages with that key and send it to the address. Second The Overlay subnetworks. TON is a multi-blockchain system and it's not limited to a single blockchain. Also every blockchain in TON consists of many shards. Now assume that node's naturally won't want to participate and receive all data for all shards available. They would want to only participate in events of some specific shards. So an overlay subnetwork is created on top of the ADNL for each shardchain to just receive the events for that subnetwork. Also overlay subnetworks will have usecases in  TON Storage, TON Proxy, ... . If you're not familiar with these network concepts and want to learn, just track the layers from OSI model. And try to read blogs and learn those concepts. And If those are not sufficient and you look for some more organized content I'd suggest trying to read network related books and try implementing or at least reading some low level protocols (It would take more time though but result in deeper understanding) You can try this book: "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross (reply to 11051)

Emerson: That is, on first read, a perfect explanation Amin, thank you. I definitely want to learn to code, which is why I am asking these kind of questions (and about TL). I understand they are rather ambiguous and infantile, but that is the result of my lack of knowledge rather than lack of effort. Thanks for your understanding and help on this matter.

Emerson: I am reading it over and over again, by the way.

Emerson: How do you think the ANDL and overlay subnetwork can be bettered? like is there a service which does not yet exist which could make the process better? perhaps making the spreading of datagrams quicker?

Amin: You're welcome, I hope that helps. These are mostly low-level concepts and relating to the core of the blockchain. To develop smart contracts you don't need to know about them as they are abstracted out and handled by node implementation or other parts ... . All of these depend on your goal and what you want to develop on TON Ecosystem.  If you talk more specific about what you're trying to do, me or other people in the group can help better. (reply to 11065)

Emerson: So my general hope is to increase users on TON, whether that is something on the technical side or an app. Both I am determined to do. Just something big which is missing from TON, hopefully something unique to TON and has some Telegram use cases

Amin: I assume that protocol has a reasonable performance and is designed carefully, making it better would first require a reason and wouldn't be a simple task. (reply to 11067)

Emerson: yes i dont think ADNLand overlay network would achieve my desired effect

Amin: TON has a fresh ecosystem and there are lots of things you can develop over it. For example DEXs are mostly in testnet stage. You can view popular products on other chains that aren't present on TON and set a goal for developing one of them as in future TON will probably need such product, like various DeFi products (Aggregators, Farms, ...) (reply to 11069)

Emerson: Yes that's true! I have all those written down - just thinking about something which would differentiate TON from everyone else. THink that would be useful too. Like how to leverage TON's uniqueness (reply to 11072)

Amin: Hmm, External message usecase would be interesting for that. for example user's can send messages to blockchain without need of an on-chain account (your contract receives the message and decides to pay the fees although with limited gas credit). This is a potential feature to attract users. you can check https://ton.org/hack-a-ton-1 and see other ideas people brought in hackaton (reply to 11073)

Emerson: interesting, whats the use case of this? (reply to 11074)

Emerson: i like the micropayments pay per view idea, thats very cool (reply to 11074)

‚Äî 2022-09-13 ‚Äî

Emerson: Why is TON so rarely used for payments? I just think even if stablecoins were out the volume would still not be high

altoshi: Too volatile, TON need stablecoin :) (reply to 11080)

Emerson: If people are not sending TON payments now (which can be quickly exchanged for $) I don't see why they would even with a Stablecoin

altoshi: Until transaction is confirmed (up to 1 minute) ton price can go up or down (reply to 11082)

Emerson: But by how much in 1 minute? By like 5bps

altoshi: Ok, what about long-term contracts, loans?) (reply to 11084)

Emerson: True, that would be great for us power users. But for regular telegram users it would make no difference

User<5111862779>: Can someone explain where receive_internal() and receive_external() are defined. And what the required/conventional parameters for these two methods

User<5111862779>: The purpose of these methods have been discussed in various places but I wondering if they are part required interface or not.  Do they need to be named exactly as receive_internal() etc?

Andrey: https://ton.org/docs/#/smart-contracts/tvm_overview (reply to 11115)

Andrey: Initialization of TVM < (reply to 11116)

User<5111862779>: I see Initialization of TVM seems to describe the parameters involved in sending a message as part of a transaction. What causes receive_internal() on the contract to be called? Is it the function signature? or the name of this particular function?

User<5111862779>: From the wallet contract  I see two functions () recv_internal(slice in_msg) impure {     ;; do nothing for internal messages }  () recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {}.   Are these the required names for these functions? Will an internal message always get routed to a function called recv_internal(slice in_msg) ?

Andrey: 1) Yes, function names are hardcoded in Asm.fif -> https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/35d17249e6b54d67a5781ebf26e4ee98e56c1e50/crypto/fift/lib/Asm.fif#L1296 so you need to define recv_internal / recv_external in smart contract 2) You need to think for arguments to those two functions as "lables" for stacks element. There is 5 element on stack, when smc is starting. You can define which items you want to load, which not. But you need to respect order of those elements :) (reply to 11119)

User<5633107531>: hey folks. i was just reading the tblkch document (https://ton-blockchain.github.io/docs/tblkch.pdf) and i came across the following, and a question popped into my mind. the text i'm talking about is:   "1.8.4. Using code libraries. Some smart contracts may share the same code, but use different data. One example of this is wallet smart contracts (cf. 1.7.6), which are likely to use the same code (throughout all wallets created by the same software), but with different data (because each wallet must use its own pair of cryptographic keys). In this case, the code for all the wallet smart contracts is best committed by the developer into a shared library; this library would reside in the masterchain, and be referred to by its hash using a special ‚Äúexternal library cell reference‚Äù as the root of the code of each wallet smart contract (or as a subtree inside that code)."  how exactly is this done in practicality? i.e. how do you commit a shared library to the masterchain? are you able to build the correct cells (library reference cells) for this using func/fift?

Yura: Hey every body. If any body can send me link to TON Wallet docs?

Batyr: Thank you. I'm a bit confused about the staking and validating. I guess it's the same thing but maybe I'm wrong. Is participation in election cycle equal to participating in staking? (reply to 11163)

talkol: To be a validator you need a lot of TON coin, more than half a million coins. So most holders can‚Äôt validate alone  There‚Äôs something called nominator pool which is a ‚Äústaking‚Äù pool which lets you join other people in the pool and participate in somebody else‚Äôs validator with a small amount - https://tonvalidators.org

Batyr: I do but my coins are restricted on lockup wallet. Can I run validator node with them? (reply to 11165)

talkol: The lockup wallet is configurable with which addresses it can send to and often it allows sending to the elector contract so you can validate with it

Ethan: And is there no revert in TON Chain?

Dario: @testgiver_ton_bot (reply to 11175)

Dario: If you are interacting only with one smart contract, yes, you can throw an error and bounce back the transaction . (reply to 11177)

Ethan: Oh, thank you. Then is there a smart contract where I can get a TESTNET TON over there and shoot a tx? (reply to 11178)

Dario: Nope, no smart contracts

Dario: As far I know

Ethan: Oh... Thank you for your answer

Yondo: then how can we confirm this? (reply to 11179)

Dario: It will set the bounced flag as true, so you can define your own bounced handler. Take a look at Jetton Wallet contract (reply to 11185)

Dario: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-wallet.fc

Alexander: Could anyone explain what does this method do? (screenshot is from tonlib_api.tl)

Alexander: (cpp usage example)

Ethan: That contract is from TON to Token contract, right? Like ERC20? (reply to 11190)

Alexander: Does it run all chain transactions for a query locally (as a get method) and returns total fees back (with no merkel proof and with no on-chain changes)?

talkol: I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve seen this part in the docs when bounced is explained (reply to 11188)

Amin: Can you provide where this behavior is described?  I haven't seen it in the docs and papers either (reply to 11188)

talkol: @SwiftAdviser definitely needs adding for clarity in the docs

Alexander: I was told that there are 256 bits in bounced message. Are you telling about 224 bits without an op (uint32)?

Dario: no, the first bits are 0xFFFFFFFF, then there will be the others 224 bits from the original message (reply to 11199)

Alexander: Got it, thanks.  To clarify for myself. send  msg_body: uint112 + ^[ uint112 ]  returns bounced message with a  msg_body: 0xFFFFFFFF + uint112   without ^ref payload, even though there is enough space for it, right? (reply to 11200)

Andrey: We are happy to present a new version of toncli in PyPi.   Several months of contributions, 216 commits, a new test system with extensive examples and helpers functions.  Also, the contributors have prepared sample projects very well covered by the new tests. For example, now 2 commands can be used to deploy NFT collection or Jetton.  toncli start nft_colletion / toncli start jetton_minter  Also available: nft_item / jetton_wallet.  All of them have a lot of interesting examples in terms of toncli and blockchain interaction, as well as very good tests that will help in developing custom smart contracts.   Also, pre-build dockers are available to simplify installation.  Release Notes: https://github.com/disintar/toncli/releases/tag/v0.0.4 PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/toncli/0.0.43/  Much of the work was done by the contributors with the support of the Ton Foundation, for which we thank the community very much.   Have fun developing, and don't forget to star toncli if you like it :)   All issues and PR are always welcome.

Amin: Hi, I have a question regarding exception after accept_message The fact that It will be replayable is obvious, but there needs to be a person who tracked the transaction and repeat it right? The same message will be accepted by contract over and over until it consumes the whole balance. I'm not sure that this sentence describes the behavior or just warns the possibility Just sent some incorrectly serialized message over testnet to the wallet contract and it repeated the transaction until it ran out of TONs. My question is, is this just a testnet behavior or mainnet too?

Tim: mainnet too

Amin: Thanks, Is there a special reason behind it? I don't get the part who replays the message in that case. (reply to 11263)

Tim: Validators replay it because they can't know that it errors.

Amin: Thanks! I think I got it. In this case it would repeat for the validator count, right? (reply to 11265)

Tim: No, it will just repeat

Amin: Technically it can be replayed forever but won't each validator know about error and the exit code of TVM eventually? IMO They shouldn't replay themselves after each one did. And in my test, in testnet, the process eventually stopped and 0.4 TONs remained. And do you have any sources about these details? I'm reading the validator's source code but it's hard to keep track (reply to 11267)

Tim: But contract and network state is not constant. His can you be sure that if you got error now you won't get it in New block. I'm not sure about specifics, it's better to avoid that situation whatsoever

Amin: Yeah, Thanks for the help! (reply to 11269)

JH: hello community! a pleasure to be here, I would like your recommendations. Well, I am thinking of migrating one of my projects to the ton network and I would like to know how the network covers them for the deployment of Smarts contracs

don Valerio: Hi, somebody know about libs ton wallet on Python? Or sdk for work with api Toncenter or similar?

davide: TONCLI new release: 0.0.4 Interesting news for developers interested in the TON ecosystem. Thanks to TONCLI it will be possible to develop smart contracts in Python language! Python is a high-level language, quite simple and accessible, and is practically one of the easiest. As we know the goal that TON has set itself is essentially simplicity despite its fascinating complexity and superiority compared to other cryptocurrencies. And that is why it was decided to make the development of smart contracts as simple as possible, thanks to TONCLI! Thanks to Andrey Tvorozhkov, who is also working on the Disintar project, one of the TON-based NFT marketplaces.

davide: how is possible?

JH: WOW, Amazing! (reply to 11276)

Ruslan: Hi, here is an equivalent of toncenter.com: https://github.com/toncenter/pytonlib (reply to 11275)

Alexander: pytonlib (1), pytonlib (2), tonsdk (reply to 11275)

Emerson: Where can I find a list of Telegram APIs? Are they all on core.telegram.org or are there more?

isoscele üíé: is this already available? (reply to 11276)

isoscele üíé: on the official website of telegram api there are the entry points of the api. You can find different implementations with Node, Python, C++ etc or you can interact using HTTP by yourself (reply to 11282)

don Valerio: thnx (reply to 11280)

don Valerio: somebody know, what wrong, i build boc in b64, sent by toncenter api by method sendBoc, get 200 status, but jettons didnt send.

davide: I don‚Äôt know, i only saw the news and report here (reply to 11283)

davide: i knew that for develop smart contract you must to use func (reply to 11288)

Slava: Is the destination account initialized? (reply to 11287)

JH: help, üôèüèª

F: It is related to python version, try downgrading it. It may also be due to the fact that you have Ubuntu 22.04 which has not been tested for compatibility with mytonctrl (reply to 11295)

F: @bitcoinbitcoinbitcoinbitcoin @matt7381 this chat was created for communication exclusively on the topic of TON

JH: thanks, solved (reply to 11314)

isoscele üíé: Is there any standard lib for math operation in func? I have to floor a number

Artemiy: Hello everyone! Could you tell me what happens when we send a transaction with a message via tonkeeper? How is this message transmitted to the smart contact? Is it just a boc with one string inside?

Daniil: In the message's BOC, comment is just a string, yes. But it isn't necessary stored in separate cell. (reply to 11342)

Nick: I miss mining ton

isoscele üíé: I was testing the behaviour of rand() function and it works properly when i deploy the smart contract. While in test environment the random number output is always the same. Why is that?

Dario: https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/math.func (reply to 11340)

isoscele üíé: apparently i just had to treat info as integer and divide it and the result remains integer. mb. anyway these are useful. thx (reply to 11348)

talkol: @dariolol - a few of us are moving some repos to the GitHub org ton-community where they will be maintained by several stakeholders together. Maybe we should create a common repo there for FunC utility functions like your math one?

Dario: Isn't that a tonwhales project? (reply to 11350)

talkol: No, TonWhales are there as well as FS Labs (Narek), core team and me.. hopefully you too :)

talkol: ton-contract-executor I believe will move there, Narek‚Äôs new wasm FunC compiler and more common infrastructure

talkol: It‚Äôs an opportunity to co-maintain repos across company boundaries

Dario: Lets discuss it

‚Äî 2022-09-21 ‚Äî

User<5674257129>: Let‚Äôs discuss

Rasoul: Hi guys

Rasoul: I was checking the ton source when I came across a Java class. What is the use of these classes? https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/example/android/src/drinkless/org/ton/Client.java

Rasoul: There are not many classes (reply to 11360)

Matthew: Is it to provide a way to execute the c++ library through Java? (reply to 11360)

Rasoul: no (reply to 11364)

Rasoul: I dont know (reply to 11364)

Rasoul: It seems that there were codes for developer testing (reply to 11364)

Martin: Hey guys! Any ton developer available for an nft project?  Pm me please

‚Äî 2022-09-22 ‚Äî

Behrang: Hi, I have a few questions about mytonctrl and validators.  Is there anyway not to store private key of the wallet for staked ton on the server?   Is there any best practices for wallet key storage?  I've started a server, and run mytonctrl successfully. However, it looks like that I have to keep private keys on the server. Maybe as part of the validation, my node needs to sign blocks, but in this case, do everyone keep their keys on the servers?

talkol: The current best practice is to use the nominator pool contact on top (which supports a pool of people staking together on one validator).  The nominator contract acts as a ‚Äúsecure‚Äù wallet that holds all the stake and moves it back and forth to the elector. It doesn‚Äôt allow sending the stake to anyone but the original depositor and the elector.  Then mytonctl only holds the key for a non-dangerous wallet which can‚Äôt touch the stake itself, only gas for elections. So even if the mytonctrl server is compromised and its key stolen, this key can‚Äôt touch the money. (reply to 11374)

talkol: Even if you just have one depositor that owns all the stake, you still create a nominator pool with just a single depositor

Behrang: Great, I got it üëç

Budong: Hi, I have a  question , If I can't get txhash in advance, how can I know whether the transaction is successful?

talkol: If you need more help with this, DM me and I‚Äôll connect you with relevant official support people (reply to 11380)

Behrang: Thank you very much. I'm working on it, if I were not successful, I'll send you a message üëçüôè (reply to 11384)

Roman: thank you very much for this example! Added it to the tonspace (reply to 11201)

·Ö†: Don't try sending 20kb messages on TON blockchain the fees are 0.4 TON üòÇ Thank God I did not try to send 1MB üòÖ

‚Äî 2022-09-24 ‚Äî

doni: anyone coming to token2049 at Singapore ?

Behrang: Another question,  How can I close a pool and withdraw its balance?  I created 2 pools, and then decided to change the configuration. Tried to withdraw from them but it was not successful. I tried to delete them, and they did. But the balance is still in there.  Not a big amount, but I just want to learn. Is there any way I can withdarw them? (reply to 11384)

Behrang: Hey, I come across this site: ton . events which looks like to be a phishing site. I was in the TON contests and it must have found my and others' address there. It airdropped me a very small amount. Links and UI is similar to ton.org, and it has an event which says you may win 1 to 100 TON. Clicking on it opens wallet . ton . event  which is a clone of wallet.ton.org.   Be ware, must be a phishing site.

Alireza: It sent me 0.0000001 TON and burnt 0.000029195 TON as fee! and deducted my balance ü§® (reply to 11398)

Alex: Hi!  Can someone share how to verify user‚Äôs wallet? I was trying to ask him to make a transaction  for 0.001 TON to the new generated wallet, but because wallet is not active, it does not report any transactions. Is there any well known ways?

Alex: Tonscan is showing that transaction, but it‚Äôs not available through HTTP api or libraries (reply to 11401)

isoscele üíé: did you set your api on the correct network? testnet/mainnet? (reply to 11402)

Alex: Yes This is the address which I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äúparse‚Äù(test net)  EQCxSu8H4BI4MTdZdC2foW1FBWL7bQvq-Q5pyh1OALEoZGkc  As I understand it gives an error because account state is Inactive. So I‚Äôm wondering is there any other ways to verify that user really owns account (reply to 11403)

Slava: You can't send the transaction without initializing the account first. Usually, the initialization happens automatically with the first sent transfer.

Slava: I guess it would be possible to use public key cryptography to verify that the user actually holds the private key tied to the wallet. But I'm not sure about all the implementation details at this point.

Alex: Does initialization cost is fixed amount of TON? (reply to 11405)

Slava: It could work like this ‚Äî you first get the user's public key either from the deployed SMC of the user wallet or from the user directly (you need to verify that pubkey corresponds with the wallet address in this case though). Then you can use the public key to encrypt some random string and send the cyphertext to the user. User then can use it's private key to decrypt the cyphertext and to present you the original random string in a plain text. This will prove that user actually owns the private key that was used to create the wallet.  Please correct me if I'm wrong though. I'm not an expert in cryptography :) (reply to 11406)

Alex: That would be 100% guarantee, but 99% of users won‚Äôt do that :) Now I‚Äôm generating hyperlink where you can send 0.01 ton with 2 clicks xD Looks like i would go with some ids in messages or pay for initialization (reply to 11408)

Slava: What do you mean by "won‚Äôt do that"? I'm not asking them to do this manually. This should be a protocol embedded in some wallet software. It should just present user with the UI like "The X service want to verify ownership of your TON wallet. Do you accept?". (reply to 11409)

Slava: It should be similar to oAuth I guess.

Alex: Got it. Thank you for the answers

Daniil: Sign a message and verify it with tonweb or something (reply to 11401)

User<1210999645>: #question   Does Ton proxy only work on web3 environment? Or can it be used in the web2 platforms?

Daniil: You can ask user to sign something like this:  // Sign custom hex const signature = await provider.send(     'ton_rawSign',     [{         data: 'ABC123'     }] ) console.log('signature is ' + signature)  Public key can be retrieved with get_public_key() method of wallet smart contract if you know user's wallet address (reply to 11401)

Daniil: I'm not sure how to verify signature, but you'll probably need to use something from tonweb or nacl

talkol: Not exactly sure how the edge conditions work in nominators, for example what happens if you delete the pools when there‚Äôs money inside (reply to 11397)

doni: In general when you refer to delete the pool / contract you mean by    destorying the contract using mode 32 ?   after checking the readme , and the code breifly   the nominator pool contract can not be destoryed ,  any withdraw op validates that the contract will have at least 10TON left.   So Im not sure there is a way to destory the contract ‚Ä¶ (reply to 11424)

doni: and any role can call recover_stake ( not only the validator)

Behrang: I've deleted them with delete_pool command in mytonctrl.   So, that 10 TON that you said is checked must be the reason, because it was less than that and I wanted to clean up blockchain üòÅ (reply to 11425)

doni: in order to test nominator pool properly ,   you probably need to go testnet, and acquire enough ton to particpate in the election ‚Ä¶  election period is about 18 hours ‚Ä¶   so you need to setup everything in order to test a nominator pool    in the other hand, if you looking to stake your ton coins,  you can particpate as a nominator in an existing nominator pool

Channel<1519271405>: Hello there How much gas will the contract consume for a single transaction in which the comment's size is 50 kilobytes to be handled?

·Ö†: Close to 1 TON I think. (reply to 11430)

Channel<1519271405>: Seriously? Such a small amount?

Channel<1519271405>: Do you mind if I DM you? I want to specify some details that are, I think, crucial for accurate estimation

Daniil: You can check it by yourself (reply to 11430)

Channel<1519271405>: Yeah, I know. But I first have to implement an algorithm in FunC

·Ö†: No sorry. Very busy and not capable blockchain as others in this chat. (reply to 11434)

Channel<1519271405>: How can you be sure then that the gas consumption will be so low? (reply to 11437)

·Ö†: I tested a Wallet. I sent close to 25kb and it cost me 0.45 TON. Thank God I wasn‚Äôt able to send 25MB or I‚Äôd be broke. üòÇ so I‚Äôm guessing 50kb would cost twice as much but I could be wrong. (reply to 11438)

User<5111862779>: Does anyone know if Testgiver TON BOT is working or down for maintenance? I sent request for TON Coin address EQBgz2cysVxEB5na5lsBiW0cbVj4uVk9N-hz0hYFM0IEjFjC on Sept 13 and again today but don‚Äôt see any update

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: judging by the transaction history, the bot issues test coins https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQBYivdc0GAk-nnczaMnYNuSjpeXu2nJS3DZ4KqLjosX5sVC  I sent a request indicating your wallet, it should come. i used bot: @testgiver_ton_bot (reply to 11447)

Cleberson: Can i send you a private message? I need something, and you can help me. (reply to 11140)

Matthew: so‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ do I understand this file correctly? https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/test-nft.js this file basically has a bunch of examples of how you can use tonweb to basically create a nft item / collection / marketplace, and transfer collections / items, etc etc. in essence, i can create nfts and nft collections and a nft marketplace without having to write any func or smart contracts

Alex: I think that it deploys standard contracts under the hood. You are mostly providing init state for it (reply to 11450)

Matthew: ahhhh ok so that‚Äôs why they use the word deploy in there. that makes more sense. so no i wouldn‚Äôt be using existing contracts on the chain already, but i don‚Äôt see why it would be too much of an issue for me to deploy new nft contracts, especially if all the func code is all already taken care of for me ü§î (reply to 11452)

Slava: Yes, TonWeb uses official contracts developed and verified by the TON FOUNDATION. If you need to change the contracts you can provide your own code (as BOC string) to the Contract constructor. (reply to 11450)

Matthew: excellent! this is making sense to me üëç

Alex: Can someone please share where I can find the difference between storing ‚Äúon chain‚Äù and ‚Äúoff chain‚Äù?

Matthew: hm that‚Äôs a pretty general question, is there something more specific you‚Äôre wondering about?

Dario: Onchain = stores everything in the Blockchain   Offchain = in the blockchain there is an URI that point to an external service to store data (reply to 11458)

altoshi: Offchain - smth is not on blockchain  Onchain - smth on blockchain  f.e when you make bitcoin transaction trough lightning network, it‚Äôs off bitcoin blockchain, so when you make a transaction trough Bitcoin mainnet it‚Äôs onchain (reply to 11458)

Alex: I‚Äôm currently exploring the nft standard and there I see the function  get_nft_content Where we return cell with the following flag .store_uint(1, 8) ;; offchain tag  Does that mean that this cell won‚Äôt be stored in blockchain history/storage?

altoshi: NFT pics are mostly stored offchain (reply to 11462)

‚Äî 2022-09-26 ‚Äî

doni: no  all contract‚Äôs storage are persistent on the blockchain   the first bit declares if the nft content is persistent offchain or on chain   offchain 0x01 - https://ipfs.io/xxxxxxxx  onchain 0x00 - cell serialized dictionary  checkout the standard   https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/64 (reply to 11462)

Lisa OOO: Good day, everyone!  Last, but not least lecture in the series of workshops during the Hack-a-TONx Prague preparation will focus on a template for a project that one may use for creating a TWA connected to TON.  The speaker for today is Shahar Yakir, jetton.live creator at Orbs. Shahar is a great technical expert of TON, he writes frontend, backend, and smart contracts.  Today on the stream Shahar will revolve around using the template and modifying the GitHub repo, that he has prepared for the community. It allows participants to fork it to add their own functionality, connect wallets and etc.   After the workshop one may do a basic operation against TON, f.e. transfer TON, work with Jettons and more üôå  29 Sept, 13:00 UTC Jumpstart at TON ecosystem: dive to TWAs  See you soon at the live stream üëà Don‚Äôt forget to ask questions, we will give 30 TON for the best one üòâ (forwarded from TON Society)

Berkcan: One day left until TON Proxy & Sites release   Before the TON Foundation kicks off the new technologies, we know that the TON community is preparing. Meanwhile, the documentation on the work of TON Proxy continues to be updated. Today, the instructions on how a user can link his TON DNS domain to a web3 website appeared on the official GitHub page.   More interestingly, according to the documentation, users can create a smart contract on The Open Network, which will allow an auction for subdomains. For example, the owner of the wallet.ton domain can hold an auction for selling second-level domains such as toncoin.wallet.ton, shop.wallet.ton, and others.  We are looking forward to the upcoming release, so we suggest the community familiarize themselves with the documentation in advance. We advise you to look over these documents if you are interested in building a decentralized internet on The Open Network. (forwarded from The Daily TON | News)

Berkcan: Is it release today or not?

User<5227889238>: Is there any way to hiding owner of nft (particulary, domain) ?

Daniil: Ton.org/docs (reply to 11581)

User<5227889238>: because If everyone can know the owner of domain, the addres of wallet, they can trace all transactions and view nft list so that privacy is decreased

User<5066048341>: Colleagues. We invite you to test the new NFT Marketplace on TON https://test.libermall.com  The opportunity to pass authorization and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù will appear one of these days. While in the test network, there is GitHub with Bag Bounty. So you can share your wishes and sowings.

Artemiy: Hi! Where can I find an example of sending an external message to smart contract? I'm wondering how I can call the recive_external function via the web interface.

talkol: Why are you using external? Are you developing your own wallet contract?  https://answers.ton.org/question/1485659652266921984/what-s-the-difference-between-internal-and-external-messages-in-ton-smart-contracts in almost all scenarios internal message is the right one to use (reply to 11589)

matthew: Hi, guys. Is it possible to find nfts via API?

NekoSenpai: COOL. (reply to 11588)

matthew: Is tonscan API open? (reply to 11600)

matthew: Tonscan use getgems graphql api to render NFT listing

doni: it might use tonapi :)   don‚Äôt know , tonscan is open source so its easy to check (reply to 11603)

matthew: is tonapi.io official API? Didnt see it in official docs

Coalus: its api developed by tonkeeper team (reply to 11606)

matthew: got u, thanks

Alex: If you need only one collection, you can scan collection by yourself directly via blockchain because each collection exposes method for providing NFT address for given nft index (reply to 11597)

NekoSenpai: Is testnet faucet bot  working?

matthew: What does it mean directly via blockchain(i am newbie in blockchain development) Do you mean this one https://toncenter.com/api/v2/? (reply to 11610)

doni: this is just the rpc server that‚Äôs exposing the blockchain data ,   but in general yes (reply to 11612)

doni: there are ways to access the blockchain   the common way to consume blockchain data in a web-app ( also known  as dapp ) is through a http endpoint

matthew: Is there some articles to read about this?

Arti: Hello, today the second day of the 72-hour continuous hackathon has begun, which means I want to share a photo report of how the first day went: 50 people gathered on the third floor of HubHub to started hack a TON in Prague üë©‚Äçüíª (forwarded from TON MAXI)

Arti: These were both experienced TON developers and guys who came with very basic ideas about the blockchain in general.    You can get acquainted with the teams and projects that were created on the first day in PDF.    The hackathon rules allow remote participants to take part in teams that are physically represented at the event.   We invite you to join the teams and help them with the implementation of smart contract solutions and even basic setup.

Bc. ≈Ωak: Hello. is there some JavaScript library to check jetton balance on my wallet?

talkol: This should give you two options: https://society.ton.org/how-ton-wallets-work-and-how-to-access-them-from-javascript (reply to 11657)

talkol: You will need to run a couple of getters, one to get the jetton wallet address and another to query the jetton wallet address for its balance

talkol: There are also some APIs that index the chain and provide this data like tonapi.io but then you‚Äôre trusting them to give you the correct info and it‚Äôs harder to verify

talkol: If you indeed decide on the route of checking it yourself, you will probably need to read this as well to understand which getters needs to be called: https://society.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-theanatomy-of-tons-jettons

Bc. ≈Ωak: Great. thank you for your help. really appreciate it (reply to 11658)

Hemi: üìö Masterclass on TON Blockchain and smart contract architecture by @oleganza of @tonkeeper at the @hackaton2022 in Prague.  Topics covered included: ‚úÖ Scalability through infinite sharding ‚úÖ The asynchronous actor model ‚úÖ smart contracts in TON should have O(1) computation time - no long lists! ‚úÖ smart contracts should aim to have just one job to be done. If a contract does 2 things (ie send token, time lock calculation) - consider splitting into 2 separate contracts  ‚úÖ Wallet "plugins" to avoid lengthy asset lists held inside wallets (again, O(1)) ‚úÖ Ton API (https://tonapi.io/) for exploring smart contract TRACEs, EVENTs, and ACTIONs ‚úÖ Abstraction of some repetitive FunC smart contract workload via a high level language, TACT (https://tact-lang.org/)  Key takeaway:  üëâ Smart contracts on TON are much more complicated than on ethereum, but this slight inconvenience for developers is worth it.  h/t to @talkol for great blog posts on some of these topics here: https://society.ton.org/  Dear developers - Welcome to TON üë©‚ÄçüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ üöÄ

User<5227889238>: Can‚Äôt I hide it? It decrease anonymity (reply to 11649)

doni: its not a simple solution ‚Ä¶   but what you can do is try to implement an  nft collection that uses a public key authentication and not an address authentication ( owner field )  this solution would probably need a recv-external in the nft-item contract .  so if you will use a separate ( from your wallet key ) private key for managing the nft item     this way you preserve anonymity   but this method has some drawbacks bc its not compatible with the nft standard, and nft marketplace wouldn‚Äôt support this nft collection.   maybe an easier solution is to manitain multiple wallets , so you can have some kind of anonymity

User<5227889238>: thank you. (reply to 11678)

talkol: What‚Äôs the anonymity use case you want to implement? Most public blockchains are not anonymous this way. You can normally see which address sends transactions / owns tokens. But you don‚Äôt know what is the real world identity behind this address (reply to 11677)

Danila: Hey, guys, I am studying the topic of upgradeable smart contracts and I have one brief question: does TON allow to upgrade SC in the future or should I use some Proxy-like patterns? It would be great if there is a page on official docs about it. Thank you!

N: I was able to build this in the past somehow, but I forgot what I did to make it work...

doni: maybe this help (reply to 11689)

doni: brew install openssl

N: Yes I did it

N: cmake says

N: -- Found OpenSSL: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1q/lib/libcrypto.dylib (found version "1.0.2o")

N: Which makes zero sense

N: And it does not work

doni: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-binaries

doni: if you dl the binaries from here ? do they work?

N: it works

N: But I would like to build it myself

N: Let me try more

doni: did you restart the terminal after the brew install

doni: maybe the env variable should re initiate ?

doni: another thing i would try is   xcode-select --install  maybe you are missing clang are something

N: I added this and it works now

N: set(OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR "/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/") set(OPENSSL_LIBRARIES "/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/lib")

doni: so the flags OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR and OPENSSL_LIBRARIES werent set I guess ‚Ä¶   probably something with reading the env variables after the openssl installation

Slava: What do you mean by "it's not possible"? (reply to 11720)

matthew: There are no capacious instructions with error handling.  ‚Äú1) Run command *blablabla* 2) Cool, you success set up ur TON SITE‚Äù

Slava: It would be more constructive if you would tell what exact problem do you have right now.

matthew: I have this error in console. And there is no word in documentation about it. But in server mode proxy works good with this error. In ton site mode it doesn‚Äôt work.

matthew: How can I understand that the proxy has started successfully, and if it doesn‚Äôt work I should check my server settings like firewall and others.  It‚Äôs just not working, and I don‚Äôt know what is wrong: server settings, ton binaries or I just had a mistake while run command.

matthew: And it‚Äôs not only my problem , then I post message here one guy went to dm and we start discuss about proxies and he has the same questions

Slava: @ruslixag can you help?

matthew: Is there russian dev chat, where we can talk in russian))

Ruslan: Yep, here it is: https://t.me/tondev

matthew: Oh, thanks (reply to 11729)

Slava: I would ask you to publish the issue resolution here as well for the sake of the English speaking developers :)

Alex: Hey all! Another dumb question there :) I‚Äôm accepting payment from user to the wallet(new wallet for each payment). So, I have the question how to make it better 1. Monitor the wallet for balance and then just call ‚Äútransfer‚Äù to main wallet 2. Create new wallet and deploy contract which would automatically forward transactions. In that case I‚Äôll monitor the transactions of wallet on back end side

Slava: Hey! The both methods will work. However, the second one will probably be better (no need for extra work). (reply to 11732)

talkol: Why talk in Russian? We want to be part of the conversation :) (reply to 11728)

talkol: English is not my native language either üòÖ

Slava: That's fair point )) (reply to 11735)

Alex: I‚Äôm just wondering which one is more idiomatic:) Method 2 is definitely require less work, but I would need to pay fee to deploy that contract (reply to 11733)

Daniil: It'll be almost the same fee as for regular wallet (reply to 11738)

Slava: You will have to pay the fee in both cases. I don't think there will be much difference. (reply to 11738)

Ruslan: Sorry for that‚Ä¶ Btw, I usually ask to move conversation in DM so as not to spam in public chats. (reply to 11734)

Slava: I guess it's fine as long as issues are getting resolved or documented somewhere, so your debugging efforts are not lost :) (reply to 11742)

Ruslan: Anyway i‚Äôll chat a summary of issue here)

Ruslan: The issue in this case was in node-server. Accessing site from curl command, we got 308 Permanent redirect error. As we found, the site was throwing requests to API non-stop. Probably this was the reason. Then we tried to host simple test site instead, and proxy worked correctly. Now @matthew_maclay will try to remove all functionalty from his site and, by adding it stepwise, will figure out which part cause problem. (reply to 11724)

matthew: And this error is not an error. It‚Äôs warning, and proxy is work after run.  [ 2][t 1][2022-10-02 10:00:11.736060209][TonlibClient.cpp:2052][!tonlibclient][&!config->ignore_cache_] Unknown LastBlockState: [Error : 0 : Unknown key]

Ruslan: And here is the recommendation for one who tries to run rldp-http-proxy: 1) try to run proxy with following command: rldp-http-proxy -p 8080 -a <your-ip>:3333 -A <your-adnl> -L ‚Äò*‚Äô -C global.config.json --verbosity 3. 2) if you see Unknown LastBlockState error ‚Äî do not worry, it is OK. 3) after this try to reach your site/service/etc with curl: curl -x <your-ip>:8080 http://<your-adnl>.adnl -v. In logs you shoud find 200 status and code of response. 4) If it doesn‚Äôt work, host some example site/service on port 80 instead and try to reach it.

This in1.ton.org should be for demonstration only, right? In real world use cases, everyone should run their own ton personal proxy on their local machine to bypass this problem?  2. Opening foundation.ton, my browser shows an insecure connection warning beside the url because the connection is not secure. I didn't quite catch the part in Ton Sites that no certificate is needed.

Node will up in 2 hours, just make sure you have 305 k- 610k TON  For testnet there's no such dumps, so you need to start own node without dump which is not that fast. You can ask in Dev chat about test coins for validator. There's special people who maintain testnet."

User<5017596334>: i tested their contract works fine for 10k (reply to 11230)

Narek: We have warnings field for that as far as i remember (reply to 11855)

Dario: dont work, it trigger an expetion and returns only exit code (reply to 11857)

Narek: But why you think it fails?

Narek: I guess fift fails only if there is something wrong in asm.fif correct me if i‚Äôm wrong

Dario: an inline asm function i wrote has a wrong sintax i guess (reply to 11859)

Narek: ü•≤

Dario: then i need to read fift logs

Narek: Will take a look

Dario: thanks

Vladimir: Thank you.  Are there instructions of how to setup a collator? (reply to 11844)

Vladimir: Anyone who deployed a private testnet could allow me to try a collator node (on OpenBSD/adJ since I have been able to port ton tools to that system)? (reply to 11844)

Vladimir: Or where could I find instructions to deploy a private testnet? (reply to 11844)

Mike: it says the bot can send the TON, but how? I cant find it at https://core.telegram.org/bots/api

Dario: manually server side: find a lib to create and sign msgs (tonweb, ton, tonutils-go etc), stream bocs using toncenter etc (reply to 11901)

Mike: Sending is clear. But I need and receive ton by bot too. Is there any ways to accept receive TONs by bot like a by simple user?

Dario: to "receive" just scan your wallet for new incoming transactions. save in db lt and hash of each transaction and tell users to add a comment on each transfer to distinguish each transfer (eg random string or their user id) (reply to 11903)

Mike: yes it is clear. But I want to users send TONs to my bot, like as to other real telegram users, from @wallet interface directly in telegam, without other wallet apps. Is it impossible? (reply to 11906)

Dario: then you can use @cryptobot (reply to 11907)

Dario: wallet doesnt offer api interface as far i know

tumbler: Hello, have a little tech question: given my v3r2 address can someone derive my v4r2 address?

tumbler: Sry it's silly I'm now to ton.

Slava: In TON an address is derived from the "state init" of the contract, which consists of the contract's code and some data. Public key is a part of this data. Along with wallet ID for some contracts. So strictly speaking knowing an address is not enough. However, by knowing an address you can load SMC data (if the wallet is deployed) and get the public key from it. Knowing the public key you can derive an address of any type of the wallet. However, if you are using non-standard wallet ID than it will be very difficult to guess it. (reply to 11913)

Slava: However, if you would scan the Blockchain looking for some specific public key than it will be possible even if you are using non-standard wallet ID.

talkol: Normally yes, assume that they can. Normally you wouldn‚Äôt maintain different wallets in different versions, you would migrate the funds to the latest wallet version you‚Äôre interested in using.  If you want to have two unrelated wallets, it‚Äôs best that you create two secret phrases.  If maintaining multiple secrets is too much of a headache you can use something like https://github.com/ton-foundation/ton-vault (reply to 11913)

tumbler: Yeah thank guys

tumbler: Was asking cuz some1 was supposed to send me on v3 (that's the address I provided) but was sent in v4 instead.

talkol: That‚Äôs strange.. normally you give the v3 contract address so I don‚Äôt understand how he could do this by mistake (reply to 11919)

talkol: It would take some effort to discover your v4 address from your v3 address, it‚Äôs not something you can accidentally do IMO

tumbler: Yeah I'm sure it wasn't by accident. And I never gave my v4 to anybody.

tumbler: Don't really know ton technicalities so I took the time to ask to see if my wallet is somehow compromised or smth.

Dario: maybe its a scam, stay safe man (reply to 11923)

talkol: Like @slavafomin explained, to derive your v4 from your v3, this person would need to go to the v3 and extract the public key and then use that to derive your v4 address.. this would require a custom script, I don‚Äôt think I saw a ready made tool that does this

doni: are you using tonhub ?   i remember they had an upgrade flow

talkol: Only to the owner (reply to 11926)

Behrang: Hey, I tried it and it just shows a "loading" result. (reply to 11788)

User<59608113>: Hello guys, published a lecture from TONANA hackaton by Oleg Andreev. Enjoy the watching üôÇ  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEO29KmOpv4  Contents:  0:00 - Intro 0:53 - Multi-blockchain actor model of TON 4:10 - Custom tokens implementation in Ethereum 7:35 - Proper implementation of custom tokens in TON 15:41 - How do we lock jettons? 20:41 - A concept of auctions for TON jettons 21:46 - One source of truth on user's jettons ownership 27:30 - Scalability vs Decentralisation trade-off 28:46 - TON API helping developers make sense of TON blockchain 31:25 - New concepts by TON API team: TRACE, EVENT, ACTIONS 37:45 - Q&A Session 1:05:38 - Takeaways (forwarded from Mark Okhman on TON)

Behrang: Beware!  This must be another phishing attempt. Looks like someone has bought the searching.ton domain and sent a phishing message here. I tried to test it, then after my feedback, someone sent me a message that looked like a support staff from Ton community. After a few message, they asked me for my wallet to fix the problem. After I asked why, they deleted the chat.  Edit: I was wrong about searching.ton itself, but phishing attack was real. (reply to 11788)

TON.SKI: Nobody can buy searching.ton domain.  Where did you receive this phishing message? In telegram? (reply to 11951)

Behrang: Why can't anyone buy it?  Yes, in telegram, after my message here. (reply to 11948)

TON.SKI: Because domain is nft, and it do not under sale. (reply to 11954)

Behrang: I know, that's for sure for any other domain which I can open a site.  So you are telling me that you are legitimate, searching.ton is valid and not a phishing site, and that the user contacted me was doing a phishing on his/her own, who saw my message asking about searching.ton as an opportunity?

Behrang: It's working now. (reply to 11948)

Behrang: Anyway, feedback:  Using the browser back button, does not update the search field, but updates the results.

TON.SKI: http://searching.ton is absolutely valid! All official telegram links are posted in site‚Äôs footer.  Any other accounts are phishing accounts. And we do not write in private messages first.

Behrang: Okay, I must admit that I come to a conclusion too quickly, and I'm sorry. The site was not working at the moment and the phishing attack at the same time, pushed me to think that searching.ton is not legitimate. (reply to 11959)

Slava: Be advised. People with fake profile verification checkmarks will be banned from the chat.

altoshi: Does TON Proxy work with Mobile Cellular on iPhone?

TON.SKI: Yeah, got u. Thanks for report) (reply to 11960)

Slava: It doesn't matter if it's cellular or not, any type of Internet connection will suffice as far as you have the proxy implementation for your platform (iPhone in this case). (reply to 11962)

Ilya: Ig he asked about the proxy setup in iOS settings. There is no option to set the proxy for cellular. Only per Wi-Fi connection, you know. The system-level proxy is available only for controlled iPhones via MDM (as I know)  So ig he asked about how he can bypass it and get access to ton network (reply to 11964)

Slava: Gosh, that's awful. Yet another reason to dump the iPhone üòÅ (reply to 11965)

altoshi: I know it, but how to setup proxy on iPhone cellular? (reply to 11964)

Ilya: Yeah. Tbh I don't know how to get access to the ton network from cellular too) I am thinking about a VPN-like app that must be published on app store. I am not sure if is it a solution. Need to dive deeper (reply to 11966)

altoshi: Also, when using TON Proxy trough iPhone, other sites don‚Äôt open, but on my MacBook I can. (reply to 11967)

Ilya: It‚Äôs because on macos you can enable proxy only for http (reply to 11969)

Ilya: The proxy setting of iOS also catch all https traffic. It doesn‚Äôt work at all with rldp http proxy

altoshi: I know, but can I enable it for iOS? (reply to 11970)

Artemiy: Hi, guys! How can I generate a string that depends on a variable of type int in Func? For example: "My value is {x}".

nonam3e: Usually strings are stored in slice structure as ASCII chars, so just put your value in the slice, if you want to store an integer, you should convert it in ASCII chars before storing. Btw " " doesn't exist onchain, you can use it only while coding your contract, it converts to slice automatically (reply to 11983)

User<5227889238>: Do you have any information about Ton-Storage?

NekoSenpai: I deploy a jetton wallet correctly . but when i try to make toncli get , i get an error. Is that normal or i have a bad configuration in the dependencys .

Alex: It‚Äôs not released yet (reply to 11989)

Hemi: According to the TON PRIMER (https://ton.org/primer.pdf, Nov 2021):   ‚ÄúTON Storage is a distributed file-storage technology accessible through the TON P2P Network. Think a better version of Dropbox for simplicity. This torrent-like technology relies on smart contracts for availability and has a strong potential with regard to storing and exchanging large amounts of data.‚Äù  This is just one part of the bigger TON vision of a distributed, decentralized, censorship free web3 (reply to 11989)

Matthew: Not sure how much the implementation might be similar to storj.io but this page might offer some insight into how decentralized storage can be implemented https://www.storj.io/how-it-works

Matthew: (Storj has no association with Ton, it‚Äôs been around for a few years now)

User<5227889238>: thankyou

Matthew: hey Tal. I‚Äôm reviewing these notes you made a while back about a possible approach to hold ton coin. i‚Äôm wondering what exactly is it about ton-offline-transaction that makes it safer than a hardware wallet? ü§î (reply to 10964)

Artemiy: Hi, can I update the code of an already deploed smart contract?

Dario: If the smart contract has set_code, yes (reply to 11999)

doni: at the moment there is no official hardware support (reply to 11998)

Matthew: Right, I‚Äôm aware of this as well. I meant a hardware wallet for other cryptocurrencies (reply to 12002)

doni: well this ( offline transaction )method generates a signed transaction,   so the transaction it self including the arguments ( destination, value , body ) is generated on a clean environment ‚Ä¶ so it has some benefits in comparison to hd wallet ‚Ä¶   for example a malware can manipulate the arguments before the hd wallet signs the transaction, ( in uniswap you can add a field that will send the funds to another adders after the swap)   so it would be very hard for the user to understand what he signs on ‚Ä¶   using the offline transaction solution eliminates this attack vector (malware) by using tails os ‚Ä¶   other than that i think they are very similar

Alien: where can I find built executables?

doni: for what os ?

doni: https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-binaries

doni: might help

Alien: decided to use toncli and it seems ok

Matthew: Ah I see‚Ä¶ so when someone has a hardware wallet, they don‚Äôt create a transaction on the wallet? They create it on their own computer or something like this? (reply to 12004)

Slava: This will only work if you can verify all the transaction details at the time of it's signing inside of the isolated system.

Slava: Otherwise the compromised external system can send spoofed transaction details to the isolated system and it will sign them without a second thought.

Slava: However, the hacked external system won't be able to steal the private key, which is good, but obviously not enough.

jb: hi guys, is it possible to use tonconnect to connect existing wallet? i runned the server-sample and /authRequest is retuning session and session_payload,,however /tonconnect is returning error{}  i have no idea where to use my wallet id to connect.. running the root / shows login by link after clicking the link its just a deadend

talkol: There is no official hardware wallet for ton yet. There are two unofficial ledger implementations that were not yet approved by ledger team. I normally don‚Äôt like to install custom software on my hardware wallets. Also, I‚Äôm not a fan of ledger in general.  Using an offline laptop gives you total control and you only rely on popular standard ton binaries that are widely used by the community for a long time (reply to 11998)

Slava: Install some secure version of Linux on a separate encrypted partition and you are good to go :)

talkol: My personal favorire is Tails (https://tails.boum.org) - boot it from a USB, it‚Äôs very privacy aware and starts fresh every time (reply to 12027)

Matthew: I haven‚Äôt experimented with ton-offline-traansaction yet, or making a wallet and a transaction, but if/when I do get around to it, one question I‚Äôll be exploring is if it would be possible to just like‚Ä¶. Print the private key, and remove any need for a laptop / machine / hardware disk to store sensitive information

Matthew: Curious if either of you have comments on that

talkol: You don‚Äôt have to store the secret key on the laptop. In the scheme described in offline, you can type the 24 words every time you boot the offline laptop. If you use an OS like Tails, it runs from RAM so there‚Äôs no persistence in any way once you turn it off.  If you send a cold storage transaction once a week, typing in 24 words is no biggie (reply to 12029)

talkol: If you‚Äôre using it daily, then you need a hot wallet solution and separate your funds into a day to day account and cold account

Matthew: So like‚Ä¶. Let‚Äôs say I have the 24 words written on a piece of paper in my bag and I travel halfway across the world without any of my personal devices or laptops, and on the other side of the world, I set up a completely new laptop / device, I‚Äôll be able to make transactions from my cold storage using just the 24 words?

talkol: Yes

talkol: You need some common tools to save you some time.. for example a USB key with Tails installed and the public files in offline repo will save you a lot of headache

Matthew: So really the separate offline laptop only needs to be fresh and offline for the setup of the wallet then ü§îü§îü§î (let‚Äôs say in this scenario the person doesn‚Äôt care to make any transactions from the wallet at all, for another 5 years)

talkol: But these files are public, even if you lose this USB it will just take you a few hours to download them all again

Matthew: Once the setup has been done and $$ has been deposited in, there‚Äôs no need for the separate offline laptop anymore

talkol: True, you can jump to a new laptop at any time. Or if you‚Äôre less paranoid, you can go to an Internet cafe and boot their laptops from the USB. Unless the hardware was tampered with in some way, it‚Äôs still secure (reply to 12039)

talkol: But if you‚Äôre traveling, I would just use my iPhone to be honest

talkol: Unless you‚Äôre an exchange holding millions of dollars, iPhone is secure enough :)

Matthew: That‚Äôs interesting that a set of a mere 24 words is secure enough. Intuitively it doesn‚Äôt feel right haha

talkol: That‚Äôs not only TON, that‚Äôs all crypto for you :)

talkol: Practically every crypto wallet in existence in any protocol can be reduced to 24 words or less :)

talkol: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/

talkol: This very cool offline HTML website will let you take the words and convert them to a private/public key pair in almost every crypto protocol

talkol: The words are just a way to easily remember a binary bit secret.  Let‚Äôs say the words are from a dictionary of 2048 allowed words - this means every word encodes 11 bit (the word is an index in a well known word array).  So 24 words encode 264 bit (24*11). Private key strength is proportional to the key length. A key length of 256 bit is considered secure enough by any means, so this leaves 8 bit for a nice checksum normally.  Just to wrap your head around 256 bit keys - if someone was trying to brute force and guess your key, they would need to try 2^256 combinations.  This number is so large you can‚Äôt comprehend it - there are less than 2^256 atoms in the universe. So it‚Äôs like hiding a specific atom in the entire universe and the attacker needs to guess which atom this is üòÇ

Dario: you can buy a pinephone as an alternative "hw wallet" (reply to 12037)

Dario: you can install debian stable, keep it offline and install any kind of wallet inside it

Matthew: I think what I miiiight end up trying to do is ya, set up a wallet on a separate offline machine, and then store the 24 words on this thing haha https://shop.ledger.com/products/cryptosteel-capsule-solo

Matthew: I could maybe find a cheaper way of keeping record of the 24 words, but I like that it‚Äôs metal (can‚Äôt get ruined by water or fire as easily) and it‚Äôs also just kind of badass haha

talkol: I hope this is just an experiment for fun, no standard personal usage would normally warrant going to all this effort :) (reply to 12053)

Matthew: It‚Äôs not necessary or worth it to set up a cold storage wallet to store a significant amount of funds? I thought that was kind of the whole point ü§îü§î (reply to 12054)

talkol: Only if you‚Äôre holding a lot of money, normally only if you are some organization like an exchange or a very big whale

Matthew: So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs not _that_ much funds then. What would be the advised approach then? The second most secure option?

talkol: Regular people write their secret words on a piece of paper and put it in a safe place and check it once a year to make sure it‚Äôs still there (the paper).  You can also keep the wallet installed on 1 extra phone for backup so even if the piece of paper is lost, you have 2 phones that hold the wallet and you can move the funds to a new wallet

talkol: If you use an iPhone with FaceID and findmy installed, it‚Äôs pretty secure and convenient. I wouldn‚Äôt go to more trouble than that

Matthew: Ah so a lot of people are comfortable storing some of their savings that are in crypto in a wallet that‚Äôs on their phone they use every day? (reply to 12058)

Matthew: It‚Äôs good to know I maybe don‚Äôt need to be that paranoid, but for good measure I probably would still make the wallet inaccessible on my daily phone haha

talkol: If you‚Äôre a bit more paranoid you can buy a hardware wallet but with ton is a little premature

talkol: You can also use a custody service if you‚Äôre willing to trust a ‚Äúbank‚Äù-like entity with your money

Matthew: I don‚Äôt think I am. Especially with how young the ecosystem is, obviously it‚Äôs different when it‚Äôs a bank that‚Äôs been around for decades and decades and millions and millions of people in the country use it and the government has big eyes on their affairs (reply to 12064)

Matthew: Ya exactly so since there‚Äôs not really a hardware solution, it makes me consider ton-offline-transaction. I think if there was a hardware solution, that‚Äôs maybe what I would go with, but still, you have to trust what ledger with their device to some extent (reply to 12063)

Matthew: Obviously if I try do it all myself there‚Äôs a risk I might do something wrong at some step, so that‚Äôs a risk I acknowledge if I try to do a more find controlled approach

talkol: Then my recommendation to you is either a ledger and trust the unofficial ton integration or an iPhone with FaceID and FindMy and trust Apple that their hardware security is good - it should be enough against anything below state agents (they can hack iPhones remotely).

talkol: There‚Äôs a plus with a phone that you know immediately when you lose it. It‚Äôs hard to unlock it without your face and you can erase it from remote.

Matthew: And if it‚Äôs an iPhone that would be with the use of an app like Tonkeeper or Tonhub right? (I‚Äôd probs pick a non custodial wallet) (reply to 12069)

talkol: Yeah

talkol: You trust the company that makes the app like you trust Ledger to make the hardware device

Matthew: Ok‚Ä¶.. that recommended approach is really really really good to know and really helpful and something I‚Äôll absolutely keep in mind ü§îü§îü§î

Matthew: Right. Understood ü§îü§î (reply to 12073)

Matthew: So hypothetically I could just create the wallet in Tonkeeper, get the 24 words, and then remove Tonkeeper from my phone. I believe that to be an option as well (if I want to prevent anyone from being able to access my wallet through my phone and use that product I linked above)

talkol: With the iPhone approach the attack vector that would concern me the most is that the app developer would be hacked and you auto update

talkol: So turning off auto update is a good solution ;)

Matthew: I think if I grab the words and then delete the app I‚Äôd be less prone to that attack vector

talkol: You still install the app every time you need to make a transfer (reply to 12079)

talkol: Keeping an old copy of an app you know is secure is probably better

Matthew: Which I don‚Äôt anticipate will be very often at all (doing transfers). In this scenario it would be an investment in the ecosystem as a way of potentially trying to profit off any ways I might decide to try contribute to this ecosystem. ie long term investment

talkol: A fun community project can be to tweak ton-offline-transaction to work on pinephone. Turn off all WiFi and 3G. Make convenient offline HTML UI to enter words and transaction details so it could sign. And display the signed transaction as a QR code on the screen.  Then create a website that uses your online computer camera to take the transaction from the QR and transmit to network.  It‚Äôs a pretty secure setup and also can be made very convenient. Ton-offline-transaction repo has 90% of the things I listed here (reply to 12050)

Matthew: Huh! Interesting ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î

Matthew: How do we feel about the OS that comes with pinephone?

Matthew: (I‚Äôm guessing it comes with one pre-installed)

talkol: I personally don‚Äôt have experience with it at all (reply to 12086)

Dario: pinephone comes with no-os (community versions cames with os like manjaro etc but it can be easly replaced). its a very secure hw (it has even hw switches to disable camera,mic etc) as long you know what you are doing (reply to 12085)

Matthew: The website that takes the transaction and transit it to the network, I guess that could be a telegram bot too (reply to 12083)

We had to move to a self moderated solution. Read more about this experience here.  I volunteered to push this forward and run a pilot for a couple of months. We'll decide if this platform is good enough to stay after the pilot.

·Ö†: A funny aside and I‚Äôm sure it applies to many testers I know @krimon can to: after a while using the same wallets you can remember the 24 words. Especially if you break them into blocks of four and use imaginative mental triggers as the words will flow and have some relation to each other. Some six year olds can memorize the entire Quran so it shouldn‚Äôt come as any surprise. @matt7381 you can try memorizing them if you travel and split them into four sheets of paper in different places with six words each and write the first 4 letters of each each word only and backwards in capital letters and/or add the next letter of the alphabet as a simple transposition cypher!)) if they really torture you it may be worth finding your memory or the papers. After all if the authorities find these papers they may think you‚Äôre a secret agent üòÇ

doni: one way to do it is to run you own full node   https://www.tonspace.co/participate/nodes/run-node/  and on top of that you need to run   https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api   with a config file that was generated by your full node ( checkout to http api Readme )    if you prefer not to run a full node , you can just use toncenter.com but it has a rate limit (

isoscele üíé: so it remarks the fact that the only stimulus a contract can have are internal and external transactions? (reply to 12138)

Daniil: There are also tick tock transactions but they're expensive and only work on master chain (reply to 12148)

MrRed.eth: thanks mate! (reply to 12147)

Daniil: In whitepaper (reply to 12151)

isoscele üíé: Ok! thank you! üëç (reply to 12152)

talkol: The normal behavior in an auction for example is to require the winner to claim their tokens after the auction ends. So the winner will trigger the last transaction after the end

talkol: Another auction approach I‚Äôve seen is to start the auction from a high price and have it reduced over time and then the first bid wins and claims the tokens on the bid transaction. This is used for example in Axie Infinity - one of the most popular NFT games that has hundreds of millions in sales

TON technical overview: A recent update to FunC introduced a bug related to the optimization of some expressions involving the bitwise NOT ~. Please update your FunC compiler from master. (forwarded from TON Status)

isoscele üíé: This is some sort of "reversed auction" where the price slowly decreases but i see it as the problem is still there. The price decreases "overtime" and the ton auction end are same problem. I don't see where the trigger could be other than some stimulus to the contract from outside. It requires some sort of external management to proc data change. Why aren't timers a thing in general in blockchain? having same lt and sharing a state shouldn't it be enough to create events contract can attach to? (reply to 12155)

Dr. Awesome Doge: Only the func compiler needs to be updated. Validators don't need to be nervous. Ha ha (reply to 12157)

talkol: External stimulus is helpful but not required in most cases. There‚Äôs no problem to end an auction without a trigger: On every bid transaction check the time (auction is not over) and if bid is highest, mark as winner. On claim transaction, check the time (auction is over) and if winner, send the tokens.  The reason most blockchains like the transactional approach is that it‚Äôs much easier to deal with fees this way. And fees are a way to fight spam.  There are external stimulus drivers for blockchain but they are usually external entities that are not part of the core protocols. Keepers is a good example of this, also my project Orbs is doing something very similar. (reply to 12158)

isoscele üíé: From a practical prospective of smart contract, isn't the must of doing a transaction everytime to change contract state too much? For example let's say a smart contract should give 10 ton on 10 successive iterations every 10 days. It's impossible to do on blockchain alone right? There should be someone (also internal) that gives "life" to smart contract remembering him to update his state. Same thing happens for dns ownership refresh i guess (reply to 12160)

Dario: Hi guys. Am I wrong, or official docs (https://ton.org/docs/#/func/stdlib) is wrong about currency? store_grams/load_grams should be in the range 0...2^120-1, not 0...2^128-1

shahar: üíé Announcing support for discoverable jettons in jetton.live! üíé  https://jetton.live/  Starting today, new jettons deployed with jetton.live will be using the new Discoverable Jetton Wallets standard (TEP-89), meaning that jetton wallet addresses can be queried with an internal message.  This is useful, for example, for DEX liquidity pool contracts which need to become aware of their jetton wallet address.  If you already previously deployed a jetton, we will soon offer a migration path that will allow holders to migrate their jettons to the new implementation. (forwarded from shahar)

shahar: this is already the case

shahar: tonkeeper has support jetton.live jettons for a while now, and the latest tonhub version also supports them

talkol: The reason for the delay in showing in some wallets was that jetton.live stores token metadata on-chain (more secure). But this wasn‚Äôt supported initially by all wallets. But it is fully supported now

&rey: I'm building timer that works on TON without any external messages so it would be considered reliable üôÇ  As well, I hope there will be a lot of users so prices could be lower than for self-hosted timers. (reply to 12161)

isoscele üíé: Now I'm curious üëÄ (reply to 12199)

&rey: I think prices will be greater than 1 TON/h (otherwise someone could schedule a message to 2106 year, and timer would have to work all of this time), but for certain price will be less than 10 TON/h. (reply to 12200)

isoscele üíé: Could you explain the idea? (reply to 12201)

&rey: The timer sends message to itself to keep working. Straightforward implementation uses too much TON, so there are some tricky optimizations, secret until timer releases üòÑ (reply to 12202)

isoscele üíé: Woa! So you auto-proc internal transactions on every blockchain block? (reply to 12203)

&rey: Yeah) But if contract would just send message to itself, it could process a lot of messages during one block. (reply to 12204)

isoscele üíé: You can actually work around async messages time to proc multishard messages so you have less fees right? (reply to 12205)

Sajjad: Hi According to what I read, the Polkadot ecosystem has long wanted to be a blockchain to connect other blockchains, and Toncoin has the same plan. If you want to have a comparison between these that have the same function and style Which are the closest competitors to this system? What are your advantages over others? Im from Iran sajjad

altoshi: The main difference is that TON aims to develop an ecosystem around workchain and masterchain, while Polkadot's goal is to unite blockchains regardless of the hub. for example, the entire TON ecosystem revolves around the main workchain, while the Statemint parachain (analogous to workchain 0) doesnt have a major role in Polkadot ecosystem. Moreover, all developments are for the convenience of building projects on TON, while Polkadot / Cosmos has a goal to create blockchains on their core (Tendermint, Substrate) (reply to 12257)

Nikita: Hi all!   I am the developer and maintainer of the OpenMask project. This open-source browser extension is a non-custodial wallet for TON. Not a commercial project.   The basis of the product has already been implemented - Jettons, NFTs, TON Proxy, etc., but there are still a lot of things that need to be done.   The application is written on a modern stack - SPA, Typescript, React 18, react-query in a functional style and uses only public APIs.   I invite all developers who have experience in web3 or want to dive into this area. If you want to join the community and become a contributor to an open-source project, we have created a backlog with tasks that we want to see in our application. Anyone can offer a solution for these problems. We will reward each success contributor with a unique NFT.  The project github: https://github.com/OpenProduct/openmask-extension and Telegram channel: @OpenProduct  Thank you!

Haider: I created both of my wallets from https://wallet.ton.org/?testnet=true.  So, I assumed that they are already deployed on the testnet automatically. For creating tonweb instance, I am using https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC (reply to 12291)

&rey: Wallets are not automatically deployed - their code is unknown until the wallet receives StateInit - usually that happens with an external message asking to transfer TON to some other address. (reply to 12293)

Haider: I have this in the testnet block explorer. It is not active

Haider: Could you guide me to the documentation to deploy it?

&rey: I don't remember well, but you could try await wallet.deploy(); (reply to 12297)

Nikita: You may just send any trancation from it via wallet interface (reply to 12297)

Haider: Alright

Haider: Thanks

Haider: I wasn't able to get it working but it's alright. I just wanted to check how to get hash for my transaction. From what I understand, this way, I will able to get the last transaction hash. Am I correct?    const transaction = await tonweb.getTransactions(address, 1)[0];  const hash = transaction.transaction_id.hash

Slava: Seems like it. But you should remember that only by using address, hash and lt you can uniquely identify a transaction in TON. (reply to 12302)

talkol: Are you planning a React Native mobile version of this codebase? I think shifting the efforts to slowly become mobile first is more inline with TON product vision (reply to 12292)

User<59608113>: Morning folks ‚òïÔ∏è  Sharing with you the Q&A with Narek Abovyan as a follow-up to the first tutorial  We talked with him about: - variables and cells - exceptions,  - external vs internal messages - development stack  Of course, I've juiced up our Q&A with some real code examples. I really hope you will enjoy watching it and better understand how TON works.  Please share this with other TONanians who are learning FunC ‚ù§Ô∏è  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cKR22XhPAA (forwarded from Mark Okhman on TON)

User<59608113>: And of course, some more practical tutorials are coming soon üôÇ  I post them initially on https://t.me/markokhmandev

User<5673688365>: Hello.   How can I send Ton coin in batches ? What multi sender tool can I use?  Thanks

User<5673688365>: Is there's any user friendly tool for Highload wallets

User<5673688365>: Saw this on github please help :   https://github.com/akifoq/highload-wallet

Deny: try to use this https://github.com/tonstack/ton3 (reply to 12425)

Deny: I sent to new address but transcation has been bounce to sender. Please help to avoid bounce to new address. Thank you..

User<1840958475>: You need to set bounce flag in transfer (reply to 12431)

User<5673688365>: Please DM. (reply to 12433)

Deny: Could you give me example? (reply to 12433)

User<5126596027>: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb try to use this (reply to 12435)

Deny: So the flag isn‚Äôt in to transfer parameter? (reply to 12438)

Cleberson: Hello everyone. Can someone help me?  How can I get the public address of someone's wallet using the connect wallet option? Is there any document I can read? Thanks

Deny: Hello, I got error invalid_bag_of_cell , anyone know what error mean? Thanks

Yakitori: Is there any plan for TON to support Solidity?

Yakitori: I think forks, like FreeTON/Everscale, did it

talkol: Not anytime soon (reply to 12446)

Yakitori: Because every time I check FunC, I remind myself how impractical this language is for coding defi apps. (reply to 12448)

Daniil: Why do you think like that? (reply to 12449)

Yakitori: Because with defi you manage money, so ideally everything should be as explicit as it gets, and easily readable.   FunC is very close to the machine, which may be great for performance, but the code is often quite hard to get from an outsider's view. (reply to 12450)

Yakitori: OOP is a great paradigm for defi, for instance, because it's easy to understand - which allows easier auditing / verification by the users.

User<1840958475>: You can use Everscale solidity in old(current) TON, but you need to understand some features to do this, because Everscale has gone far ahead and updated was TVM in ever (reply to 12451)

User<1840958475>: Ever solidity is really cool

Daniil: What about tact language? https://tact-lang.org/ (reply to 12451)

User<1840958475>: It's not programming language, it's just a "likeness" of programming language, which translates into FunC. Tact => FunC => FiftASM => TVM Byte code. This can only add more bugs and weirdness (reply to 12457)

User<1840958475>: just zoomer lol

Andrey: That's not true, they will do Tact => Tvm directly (reply to 12458)

User<1840958475>: "they will do", but now it's a pice of sh... (reply to 12460)

User<1840958475>: I'd rather use solidity. Why do I need the tact?

Slava: That's doubtful. I have seen a lot of OOP code that was a fucked up mess. The quality and readability of the code primarily depends on the code author and only secondly on the language in question. Each language supports abstraction and this is a great tool to make your code easily readable. (reply to 12454)

User<1840958475>: Is readable C code possible? No. Is readable FunC code possible? No too. (reply to 12463)

Nick: Is that efficient enough for stack-based machines? üôÇ (reply to 12462)

User<1840958475>: yes, solidity is enough optimized and efficient (reply to 12465)

Nick: What about LLVM? (reply to 12466)

Slava: Abstract complex parts into manageable modules, cover them with unit tests and build your main program out of these modules using a layered approach ‚Äî if your abstraction is good ‚Äî you will get a good readable code.

User<1840958475>: developers want tap tap and get the result, they don't want to count bits, wake up to reality and business processes (reply to 12468)

User<1840958475>: look at the source code of FunC and laugh at what you call a programming language

User<1840958475>: I can write readable, well-working code in FunC, but it obviously takes longer than if I were writing it in Solidity. And that's given my deep knowledge of FunC

Slava: I'm not talking about funC per se, I'm talking about any programming language in general, because the point that I've mentioned still stands. I have no doubt that you can write terribly unreadable code in Solidity, and I've seen such examples.

User<1840958475>: Yes, I agree with this, you can write terribly unreadable code in Solidity (reply to 12472)

Yakitori: I never said that OOP code is always pristine, rather that it's easier to read if written well. To illustrate, you can compare the Jetton contract (well, only the wallet!) to its Solidity counterpart. (reply to 12463)

Yakitori: Thanks, I didn't know about it! (reply to 12457)

Yakitori: I mean, 50 lines of code just to send tokens, including some assembler stuff, with 0 comment - why?

Alien: Hey I followed this tutorial and got this error: error: redefinition of built-in assembler function `cons`   forall X -> tuple cons(X head, tuple tail) asm "CONS"; . . . raise ValueError(f"üò• No address_text found in {contract.address}") ValueError: üò• No address_text found in C:\Users\[my-username]\AppData\Local\toncli\toncli\wallet/build/contract_address

Alien: should I install toncli on linux for better development exprience?

Andrey: Just comment all duplicating functions in your code (reply to 12480)

Alien: I understand it seems like a c/c++ duplicate identifier error. but code is rather simple: () recv_internal(slice in_msg_body) impure {   throw_if(35,in_msg_body.slice_bits() < 32);    int n = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);    slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();   int total = ds~load_uint(64);    total += n;    set_data(begin_cell().store_uint(total, 64).end_cell()); }   int get_total() method_id {   slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();    int total = ds~load_uint(64);      return total; } And I'm running :  toncli deploy -n testnet (reply to 12482)

Alien: Just use old gold ubuntu. windows is error prone for Ton development (reply to 12483)

Mr. John: bounceable flag is Address parameter (reply to 12439)

Alien: ubuntu is ok

Mr. John: 18.04

Dario: Arch :v (reply to 12490)

Dario: No, actually there is ton-git aur package which is pretty useful

Dario: So the installation is pretty simple, just run yay -S ton-git

Dario: If you are under windows, maybe its easier if you just use js packages

N: Same issue (reply to 12536)

Dry: Are there any simple dApps that run natively on TON? I would like to learn how to interact with TON smart contracts (probably with tonweb?), but don‚Äôt know where to start.

N: Can anyone help explain how to send external message in toncli?

Fortune: How do we convert contract.pk from toncli to 32-byte public key (and 32-byte private key)

Fortune: Or rather if contract.pk is private key bytes, how do I get public key?

Fortune: How do I print a constant in fift?

Alien: How one can include functions from stdlib in tests folder?!! error: undefined function `.slice_bits`, defining a global function of unknown type         throw_if(35, in_msg_body.slice_bits() < 32);

Mark: Good day! Excude me, where I can read about recv_internal signature? I'm trying to understand difference between cell in_msg_full and slice in_msg_body One of the sources tells: ;;;; Cell with an incoming message ;;;; Incoming message body, slice type Does it mean the "in_msg_full" stores contract itself and in_msg_body is what comes to the contract from the outside (with a message)?

Mark: So in the first task we already have an injection point: execute(request), and it only take to write a function that would send TONs pulled from the contract to your own wallet Am I right?

Mark: Oh somebody already made it happenüôÇ

shahar: I‚Äôm trying to understand the way SEND_MODE works, especially the 2 (ignore errors) flag.  I have a contract which does the following:  () recv_internal(‚Ä¶) {      ‚Ä¶      set_data(‚Ä¶)      send_raw_message(‚Ä¶, 128 + 2)  }   If the contract does not have enough balance to carry out the action enqueued by send_raw_message, I get: 1. exit code 0 for compute phase 2. exit code 37 (not enough balance) in action phase 3. changes do not get persisted to storage 4. I send my message with a bounce flag, but the amount does not get bounced back to my wallet  Is it the intended behavior that messages only bounce in the compute phase? do errors in the action phase get swallowed?

N: Anyone know how logic time is implemented in TON?

User<470063563>: I'm trying to send via toncli but getting this:   "ERROR: ÔøΩ Please, send more TON for deployment to ... "

Sadegh: Oh sorry thx (reply to 12626)

Ruslan: Please, make a backup of the content of your private folder. If you loose it, you have to send another transaction and pay fees to change the adnl

Sadegh: I excuted your docker and I have private keys and, I set hex adnl..  Now just need to route my custom Django port to ton site (reply to 12652)

Ruslan: Fine, in file .env change TON_PROXY_REMOTE_ADDR variable to <ip-of-django>:<your-port>. If Django is running on the same machine, use localhost. After this restart container with docker compose restart rldp-proxy.

Ruslan: Don‚Äôt remove double quotes (reply to 12656)

Ruslan: Next: try to open your site from console: curl -x in1.ton.org:8080 http://<your-domain>.ton -v. You should see the html-source of your site. If don‚Äôt, check the output for problems. (reply to 12654)

Ruslan: This one: docker compose restart rldp-proxy

Ruslan: Maybe you should use this one: docker-compose restart rldp-proxy

Ruslan: And maybe sudo is required

Sadegh: I don't know where is rldp-proxy repo, (reply to 12674)

Ruslan: And where did you started this docker?

Sadegh: Ton proxy docker repo (reply to 12678)

Ruslan: Oh, sure. In the root of this repo

Ruslan: I‚Äôve missed the name

Ruslan: Docker-compose up

Andrey: "TonUtil.fif" include  "build/contract.pk" load-generate-keypair // generate key pair constant private_key  // save private to constant constant public_key // save public to constant  ."Private key: " private_key Bx. cr ."Public key: " public_key Bx. cr  Create fift/print-hex.fif in wallet project in config of toncli, then run üôÇ (reply to 12700)

Fortune: Thanks it worked

Fortune: If I don't add the public key to the data cell when deploying the contract, would it still be mappable to any wallet version address?

Fortune: On ton explorer it shows as unknown contract in Contract Type. And I'm guessing that may be why

Andrey: Explorers use hash code of wallets to check if  it is wallet, but there is custom ‚Äúhello_world‚Äù get method in toncli code, so it‚Äôs not worked correctly (reply to 12707)

Andrey: We think to remove it to add support üôÇ

Mikhail: Hello everyone

Mikhail: Does Fragment have public API?

Fortune: When using lite-client's sendfile x.boc or it's toncenter API equivalent, does the boc data get broadcast to every wallet's recv_external then the signature (starting bytes of x.boc) checked and processed if matched.  I'm just trying to understand as there's no standard for external messages and boc seems to be processed as-is (no prior prefix processing by a router) in wallet, nor a means to put a destination address parameter in the above mentioned methods to direct where your boc goes to. It's just sent "to the Blockchain"

Mikhail: My question is about fragment.com, ton auction where users can buy and sell their usernames (reply to 12854)

Mikhail: maybe someone know something about my question

Seitaro: Actually all auctions, betting etc happens onchain. So fragment.com is kind of DApp - application with TON blockchain as backend. That is how disintar and getgems got the data: directly from blockchain. So you can get data from blockchain as well, or using indexes provided by tonapi.io and dton. (reply to 12872)

Mikhail: can i do it for checking is username is free or not? (reply to 12875)

Daniil: I think you can use some library that can work with cells and addresses in TON (like tonweb) to get the smart contract address of some specific username/domain and then use any API provider to check if that address is active or not (reply to 12876)

Mikhail: Thanks for the idea (Spasibo)

Daniil: Smart contract address in TON depends on it's initial code and data, so if you know the code (it's public) and data (username you would like to check), you can get the address

Daniil: Maybe there's some easier way to do that, but it is the first thing that comes to my mind

Daniil: Also if you really trust fragment.com, you can just parse their website to get the required information üòÅ

Fortune: Any ideas would be helpful. I'm using a non-standard recv_external. And all the documentation I've gone through speaks very sparsely on how to order the boc, and how exactly they're processed when externally sent (reply to 12855)

Saber: Hi, I have a technical question about the NFT standard as I was developing my GameFi on the NFT standard:)  Why are we relying on the user side to send the ‚ÄúcontentNFTURI‚Äù? was it a feasibility issue?  The problem that I see is that in my Dapp I have to query the nft-collection for the latest nft-index and use it to make the ‚ÄúcontentNFTURI‚Äù ref and then send the tx to TON blockchain, but what if at the same time another user of my Dapp also do the same(the stste of the contract will show e.g. 10 as the latest index), so they will send 11 as the contentNFTURI and that will cause a problem in the metadata of the nft of one of them.

Mr. John: you need to send ~1 ton before deployment to contract address

User<5577179416>: const transfer = await wallet.createTransfer({         secretKey: key.secretKey, // from the secret mnemonic of the deployer wallet         seqno: seqno,         sendMode: SendMode.PAY_GAS_SEPARATLY + SendMode.IGNORE_ERRORS,         order: new InternalMessage({         to: newContractAddress, // calculated before         value: 0.02, // fund the new contract with 0.02 TON to pay rent         bounce: false,         body: new CommonMessageInfo({             stateInit: new StateInit({ data: initDataCell, code: initCodeCell }), // calculated before             body: null,         }),         }),     });  yes, I am sending 0.02 TON here

Mr. John: its balance is 0

User<5577179416>: Tried, with 0.5 Also, probably a stupid question. But why each time I deploy it, new contract address remains same? üòï

Mr. John: send it manually

Mr. John: you need to send to non-bounceable address btw

Mr. John: or funds will be returned

User<5577179416>: I don't understand what this mean. In tutorial, he is funding the smart contract in transfer with value: 0.02 (reply to 13019)

Mr. John: starting with UQ

Mr. John: not EQ

User<5577179416>: Ah... but where can I find it?

Mr. John: make address.toString() with bounce = false

Mr. John: i dont know which argument in tonweb used for making address non-bounceable

Yura: Hey guys! Trying to connect to tonwallet with this repo https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/utils/README.md and every time  got a different wallet address from const nonBounceableAddress = address.toString(true, true, false); Some one can explain me what i doing wrong?

&rey: I have an idea how to improve NFT and jettons: Authorized-Controllable Tokens.  For example, consider someone who needs to transfer NFT to other person at specified time. First person would request timer to schedule message. Then he needs to allow this message to transfer NFT; he could transfer NFT to timer account first but then (1) NFT wouldn't be visible on the first account, (2) in case of some bugs NFT will remain on timer account forever, (3) someone could request another message transferring NFT from timer smart-contract to her first.  So I propose to create Authorized-Controllable Tokens. Owner of some assets sends an authorization message (contanining address of controlled tokens, allowed operations and so on) to smart-contract. At needed time smart-contract sends a message with Merkle proof of its authorization to NFT/jetton wallet contract, token checks the proof and performs the requested operation.  If owner wishes to revoke control on his token, he could send a message revoke_authorizations_before to his token (not to authorized contract, because that would need to increase Merkle proof to prove that there were no deauthorize messages).

Mr. John: Bet you every time generate new mnemonic (reply to 13064)

Narek: Hey guys! We are planning to improve ton-contract-executor and we need some feedback from those of yours who use it!  What kind of functionality do you miss?  Maybe you are facing some problems using it?

Yura: Yes I understand but it's just because I trying couple of times. In normal flow I'll call this method only once. But even the first time it's returns me not my wallet address. (reply to 13067)

Mr. John: Library agnostic (reply to 13068)

Dario: sometime it reach memory limits, i cant test some stuff with it (reply to 13068)

Mr. John: Just save words from new Menmonic() and use them later (reply to 13069)

Tim: make Ton3Cell and TonCell to have same toBoc signature (reply to 13070)

altoshi: You just invented deferred transactions (reply to 13066)

Narek: Can you provide minimal example? (reply to 13071)

Mr. John: Better throw bytes and have ton as optional dependency (reply to 13073)

Amin: Hi! ton-contract-executor is great for testing contracts There is a small problem that it uses old version of ton-compiler, which is not WASM-based. It doesn't work on windows for instance. It would be great to upgrade to ton-compiler v2.0.0. Actually I created a PR about a week ago and upgraded to the ton-compiler v2.0.0 with the needed changes. (reply to 13068)

Mr. John: Which will map to its native types (reply to 13076)

Tim: It'll make usage harder. I think it's possible to make it new SmartContract(code: TonCell | Ton3Cell), but fully library agnostic is too far (reply to 13076)

Narek: Yeah, i think we will remove fromFuncSource, so you can use ton-compiler or func-js (which runs on web too) for compiling (reply to 13077)

Narek: I think we should keep executor as simple abstraction over TVM

Andrey: BTW if someone use python, you can checkout https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/494  You can emulate tvm in python, get all op codes, and stacks. Also it easy to debug transactions in browser with dton: https://dton.io/tx/BAAC47F3588AFDF356058AD951CA99F1A48F372635766BE729804EF068911195?time=2022-10-30%2003:12:12  (Computation phase -> Server run) You can check all tvm op, and stacks. It's pre early beta not final at all, but very useful :) (reply to 13068)

Amin: fromFuncSource can remain too with just temporary file workaround. I don't know about the web environment, that's why you think removing it is better? (reply to 13080)

Narek: I think we should remove that to keep executor simple layer above TVM, compilers should be used from other packages (like func-js or ton-compiler) Aslo fromFuncSource accepts only single source file and does not support imports and stuff like that

Amin: Hmm, that's a nice idea. (reply to 13084)

ùê¥ùëÖùê∏ùêπ ùëÜùëÜ: If there's anyone who wants to make this idea operational, we can team up together. (reply to 13060)

Tim: You can also trade nfts on getgems for example (reply to 13090)

ùê¥ùëÖùê∏ùêπ ùëÜùëÜ: Yes, But they haven't added the ability to buy and use the username yet. Otherwise, we can plan from now on, before we can offer this capability. (reply to 13091)

altoshi: It‚Äôs impossible at the moment. (reply to 13092)

ùê¥ùëÖùê∏ùêπ ùëÜùëÜ: A market for usernames only (reply to 13091)

altoshi: For secondary market, there is already getgems.io and disintar.io and you will be able to trade on fragment.com too. (reply to 13095)

altoshi: Because TON Bridge is a ‚Äúsmall POS network‚Äù upon the TON blockchain, it has its own nodes with their oracle stake (multinode bridge) , that‚Äôs why fees are pretty high, they are going to these bridge nodes who are securing the bridge. (reply to 12596)

Silvio: Thanks. ‚ù§Ô∏è  So isn't the token bridge a small PoS network too? (reply to 13107)

altoshi: I‚Äôm not sure since it doesn‚Äôt have tech docs, but I think it‚Äôs not a small network too, because it would be very not profitable to hold ur own oracle node to secure the token bridge, since transaction fees are pretty low. (reply to 13108)

Silvio: So we get low fees at the expense of bridge safety? (reply to 13109)

altoshi: Yes (reply to 13110)

Kon: ton wallet doesn't support jetton yet https://github.com/toncenter/ton-wallet/issues/154 (reply to 13114)

Hemi: GM. Does anyone know if the TON blockchain has been stress tested ? For example, has sharding happened? If not, under what conditions can we expect to see sharding occur?

Kon: Found it, there was not "amount", but "value" for a wallet by transfer, code 34 is related to "not enough money to forward" (reply to 13106)

Yigael: A shard chain splits when 64 consecutive blocks were 90%+ full. I'm not sure what the max capacity of a block is but let's assume it's 1K transactions, and a block is generated every 5 seconds => it will take ~64K transactions wanting to be pushed into the chain over a period of 5.3 minutes (64*5/60) that will cause a single shard split (reply to 13117)

Hemi: I wonder if that has happened yet on TON? Anyone here know? (reply to 13125)

Anil: Under the dome

Yigael: that would be a sight to see!

Dario: I think it happened in masterchain (reply to 13126)

Hemi: masterchain?? do you have details? when did it happen? how? (reply to 13129)

Dario: No jk i was wrong, masterchain dont split at all (reply to 13130)

Yigael: True:) (reply to 13131)

&rey: If you need a tool to observe that, you'll be able to try toncli lc allshards - currently it shows that there are no shards neither in mainnet nor in testnet. (reply to 13128)

Slava: As far as I know such tests were performed in the testnet some time ago. (reply to 13126)

&rey: I've looked through the docs and found out that Authorized-Controllable Tokens would need information about TON blocks. So I have three proposals for TON developers and validators: 1. add shardchain configuration into either global config parameters or c7 (temporary data) 2. add most recent masterchain and shardchain block data into c7 (not representation hashes but full data) 3. possibly add representation hash of some key block (for example, last block signed by previous validators group) into each block serialization to reduce sizes of Merkle proof of transaction existence (reply to 13066)

Slava: I would suggest you to write a paper on your proposal if you are serious about it. (reply to 13135)

Slava: After that, file it as TEP.

lin: Is it possible to predict the txhash in advance before sending the transaction to the chain

&rey: It's very hard as you send a message, not a transaction. Things that you certainly need to predict are tx logical and UNIX time (lt can depend on messages imported from other shardchains) and contract storage fee (that depends on time since last message to contract) and maybe block random seed generated by validators. (reply to 13218)

lin: I just need to send a normal transfer transaction, I want to know the transaction hash and the required fees in advance, is this possible?

&rey: It's easier to consider you can't know tx hash in advance and can only calculate its fees approximately (with precision <1/10000 TON, but not exactly). (reply to 13220)

&rey: If storage fee isn't important, then you are able to emulate message and calculate all the remaining fees precisely.

Freemine: I think it's not possible at this time (reply to 13296)

AMSTER: yep. I can't find any information about it. the usernames currently being sold for the fragment are nft. like dns (ton domains). but with the creation and purchase of a dns ton everything is clear. I don't understand how people can create their own nft usernames Telegram. how they will confirm ownership of the username and how this nft will be deployed. (reply to 13300)

AMSTER: nope (reply to 13302)

Freemine: There's a function in their contract which you can mint your username as nft with cost of 1 ton but i don't see that function in ui till now üòÖ. (reply to 13301)

AMSTER: now the fragment sells usernames (nft), which are created by the fragment itself. I can't create nft my username, deploy it to my wallet, and sell it on the auction. I'm wondering if this will be available (reply to 13304)

AMSTER: yep :D (reply to 13305)

&rey: I doubt whether this will be available at all, as that would mean Telegram deleting your username. (reply to 13306)

AMSTER: but then how are they going to make the username an asset? (reply to 13308)

AMSTER: username can be set not only on my profile. channel, group (reply to 13308)

&rey: As far as I know, currently they sell only free usernames (and those occupied by inactive channels). (reply to 13309)

AMSTER: so it remains to wait ) (reply to 13311)

AMSTER: according to Durov, usernames will become assets. and everyone will be able to sell or buy any username. so i have a question. how can a person make nft with his username (profile, channel or chat), and prove that this username belongs to him? and most importantly, what happens after the sale?) that is, the username disappears for the seller, and the username appears for the buyer (owner of the asset)? strange

Freemine: What will happen to username after sale ? A bot will login to your account and will change username. Like those channels have blue verification tick (reply to 13314)

AMSTER: I think about it too. i think it will be possible to create nft in the "Telegram Usernames" collection, a "description" and "metadata" will be added. in the metadata will be "description, image, name" (reply to 13315)

AMSTER: what is chain? Ton? (reply to 13321)

AMSTER: There are chains on which it is easier to launch a project. Like BSC or ETH.  make a presale or fire launch, add liquidity and trade on CEX exchanges or exchanges like Dex, CMC, CG

AMSTER: I don't mind the ton. I'm talking about the fact that at the moment it is difficult to launch projects on the Ton network

talkol: Search for your Jetton by address in the main page. Then connect your wallet that deployed it. You should have the ability to update metadata (reply to 13409)

Behrang: Hi,  I have a few questions about bounceable addresses.  I used TON Wallet chrome extension to send TON to a bounceable address. This address was new, and I expected it to bounce back, but it doesn't, and the address now has a positive balance, even though it is still uninitialized.  1- Shouldn't it be bounced back?  2- Does TON Wallet extension sends the transaction as non-bounceable even though I entered a bounceable address?

Alex: https://hub.docker.com/r/trinketer22/func_docker/ (reply to 13432)

Slava: Hey! It won't bounce back and yes, TON wallet changes the flag to non-bounce when the destination account is not active. (reply to 13428)

Behrang: Thanks. Looks like this approach can simplify things by not requiring non-developers to know about them. (reply to 13438)

Slava: Yes, however, the better UX approach would be to warn the wallet user that the destination address is not initialized. (reply to 13440)

Slava: E.g. "Would you still want to send the transfer to the uninitialized wallet?"

jim: Hi everyone, I'm deploying liteserver through Docker, There is a problem at present The lite-client command can be used normallyÔºåHowever, if accessed through ton http api, it returns 504 code

jim: Can someone help me?

Kaio_toxik: Tell me pls is it possible to delete or edit NFT? it was deployed without 0.json so 0 NFT shows without metadata and picture

·Ö†: You can mint nft to collection as i know

·Ö†: so you can ask it in marketplaces

·Ö†: they can hide

Kaio_toxik: In the Collection base URL, enter the common path to your NFT metadata in JSON format. For instance, if you enter http://yourcollection.com/nft/ then the first NFT metadata should be hosted at http://yourcollection.com/nft/0.json, the second at http://yourcollection.com/nft/1.json, etc. These files should be hosted on your side. You can change this path later on if you need to.ü§î

Kaio_toxik: You can change this path later on if you need to

Kaio_toxik: If to add 0.json now to that directory? Will it fix the situation?

Ruslan: Hi!  Did you publish necessary ports in Docker container? And can you please check if this command works from cli lite-client? (reply to 13454)

jim: Yes, I opened the port, and the nodes are also synchronized at present. (reply to 12112)

jim: @ruslixag  This is the information displayed on the current command line.

doni: so whats the problem ?

jim: I can't access him through ton-http-api.

jim: https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api/blob/master/README.md  I followed the description here.

doni: you dont even see the swagger page right ?

doni: the html ?

doni: you can try curl it from the vps it self

doni: like curl localhost:8080 ( i don‚Äôt remember whats the port )

jim: Yes, I did access it like this, but he returned the 504 code.

jim: lite server logs are also some mistakes, but I'm not sure it's normal.

doni: did you create the config file yourself?

jim: I downloaded the file of this website and modified it.Ôºàhttps://ton.org/global-config.json ÔºâÔºåIf it is not modified, it can be connected to the public node.    But when I point it to my lite server address, I return to 504 code

jim: I modified the configuration here according to the instructions.

doni: awk

jim: Anyway, thank you for your reply.

Ruslan: I have no idea why it doesn‚Äôt work. Everything looks normal

jim: There are some errors in the node log. Are they related to it?

Ruslan: The last errors are

Ruslan: But they are not informativeü•≤

Ruslan: Have you tried to restart http-api container?

Ruslan: Sometimes it works

jim: I have tried it many times. Every time I restart, the following logs will appear in the node.

Ruslan: Maybe you need to change init_block in your config (reply to 13500)

Ruslan: https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getBlockHeader?workchain=-1&shard=-9223372036854775808&seqno=24910721

Ruslan: Try this one. Check it‚Äôs id

jim: Where is this configuration?

Ruslan: In the end of this file (reply to 13490)

jim: Thank you. Let me have a try.

jim: Thank you very much. He is really useful. (reply to 13505)

Ruslan: So, the problem was following: - when you trying to get the block, ton-http-api downloads and checks proof for this block (one may found details here: https://ton.org/whitepaper.pdf) - ton-http-api uses init_block to get it - this block is old enough to be not in db and causes error

jim: yes!

Ruslan: Another solution you may try is to make ttl bigger (default is a few days). You can change it to 1-2 years if you have enough storage)

jim: Okay (reply to 13510)

davide: how can I be sure that my smart contract is secured?

Roman: you can check source code and address, and compare. For example, with this tool:  https://verifier.tonsc.org/ (reply to 13512)

Roman: if the contract deployed to address and contract sources are not equal ‚Äî this is probably a scam

Dr. Awesome Doge: Awesome

Daniil: Write tests and maybe ask someone experienced in vulnerabilities for help (reply to 13523)

doni: Yes tests are the way to go

doni: of course audit is important if we assume this contract will hold real funds

isoscele üíé: What do you mean by audit (reply to 13531)

doni: There are audit companies ( like quantstamp, cetrik ‚Ä¶ ) which audits smart contract , basicly they are analyzing the contract and trying to attack the code and find security holes ,   they can provide some kind of assurance that code is verfied , and safe ‚Ä¶   ofocurse nothing safe in our world ‚Ä¶

Daniil: Code audit by someone experienced to find problems and vulnerabilities. Some companies are also doing audits (reply to 13532)

isoscele üíé: Ohh ok thx

isoscele üíé: Some names of them on ton?

isoscele üíé: Never heard of auditing companies on ton smart contracts

Dario: By the way, before audits from other companies the TF should work on static code analysis tools (like mythril) for func code, it could be really useful

Slava: Just post a contract hacking challenge with good monetary compensation and you will attract the necessary interest.

Daniil: I heard something about 0xguard (reply to 13537)

Daniil: Yeah that's also a good idea (reply to 13540)

&rey: Isn't it possible to transpile code (maybe, Fift) into language like C++/Java and run static analysis on that? (reply to 13538)

Dario: No and could be really dangerous/useless since internally it works differently. Better to setup an open registry for common unsafe practices and build a tool on top of that (reply to 13543)

Dario: At least, this is my opinion* (reply to 13544)

User<1613666170>: For example a token is created on TON blockchain, is there a platform to swap that token back to TON ?

Greg | GriGon: Hello everyone, my name is Greg, I develop on solana, but would like to explore developing applications on ton as well. Is there any good documentation for frameworks that are used for ton development? Also is there conventional way to create telegram bot user interfaces for ton chain?

Slava: Hello and welcome! For docs see this message. For Telegram in general I would highly recommend grammY framework. (reply to 13554)

Greg | GriGon: Interesting, is grammy similar to Anchor or Truffle for SOL & EVM respectively? (reply to 13555)

lin: ton's address format is base64 or base64UrlÔºü

lin: I call packAddress api which sometimes returns base64 and sometimes base64Url

Max: Addresses can be turned into strings in several ways, both base64 and base64url can be used (reply to 13559)

Max: What's the packAddress api you're referring to?

lin: Is the base64Url used by the ton wallet plugin wallet?

Max: I think it will accept any format of addresses, not 100% sure though  In any case, it's easy to convert between b64 and b64url, just replace "+" -> "-" and "/" -> "_" or vice versa (reply to 13564)

lin: Yes, I want to confirm what format most people used

Saber: Has anyone faced this cors issue when using ton client?  Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field x-ton-client-version is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.

Tim: You can disable that header in ton source

Saber: thank you, I removed this line in ton installed package in the node_module(to test), and now the requests work. (reply to 13571)

Saber: But, I guess it‚Äôs not the best idea to change node_module files (reply to 13573)

Slava: That's definitely a bad idea. You should create an issue for the library or send a PR. (reply to 13574)

Slava: By the way, @ruslixag do you think that API should be relaxed to allow such unrecognized headers?

Ruslan: Maybe it should be. (reply to 13576)

o8wqc: Hello, is it necessary to deploy a contract to activate an account?

o8wqc: Thank you very much for your enthusiastic answer, I found how to use golang sdk to create a wallet, thank you very much (reply to 13581)

Ruslan: I've checked: there should not be any restrictions on headers. I've restarted testnet-toncenter. It should work well (reply to 13573)

Saber: yes, it‚Äôs working now, thank you (reply to 13584)

Ruslan: Looks like problem occurs if you debuging your app. In this case origin is localhost:3000 and for this origin there is some limitations.

Ruslan: Upd. I've missed. There are restrictions for headers. I've removed them for testnet, but on mainnet they will stay (reply to 13584)

Mark Okhman on TON: Hey guys, i've opened a discussion about Junior / Middle / Senior FunC developer  What are your thoughts on this gradation?  https://www.toncompany.org/c/ton-edu-projects/junior-middle-senior-func-developer

Purple: If you learn fift, you automatically become a senior (reply to 13590)

Mark Okhman on TON: this is quite classic break down i agree with @visualstudi0 to a curtain extent though  do we mean that everyone in FunC is no higher then middle? I believe we need to use other gradation rather then amount of years (reply to 13591)

OWNED: i have a legit Q as far as fragment goes, with ton network why is it No usa customers can use this? with tokkeeper i cannot scan and use the QR code on fragment bc it states not useable to the united states... so its only non usa ppl?

OWNED: like me i own 210 single word usernames myself, and cannot list them for auction at all lol thats crazy

Slava: Sadly, the experience in terms of years doesn't show much. I knew expert developers with just 3 years of experience and juniors who worked for 20 years without growing their knowledge much. (reply to 13591)

Mark Okhman on TON: ü•∫

Daniil: hope they'll fix that asap

isoscele üíé: Starting from a serialized cell, can it be deserialized without knowing what's inside?

Dario: yes (as long enough bits has been written otherwise you will get cell underflow) but you will get useless data (reply to 13637)

Daniil: you can't deserialize data if you don't know what is the type of that data. that's why we have TL-B schemes everywhere (reply to 13637)

isoscele üíé: So what about arbitrary msgs between smart contracts? On tonapi . io it understands msg body data. Is it because format of these messages is standard and recv_internal of those smart contracts are public? (reply to 13639)

Daniil: check out https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/block/block.tlb  all important types are described there, including messages (reply to 13640)

Daniil: msg body can be any type but there are also some agreements on that: https://ton.org/docs/#/howto/smart-contract-guidelines?id=internal-messages  "In order to achieve this goal, the following recommended internal message layout can be used (notice that the TON Blockchain does not enforce any restrictions on the message body, so these are indeed just recommendations)"

isoscele üíé: It's clear for me that looking at constructors you can parse following TL-B schema. My question was more about arbitrary bodies between contracts (reply to 13641)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: 14:20 UTC, working (reply to 13632)

Nikita: Hey everyone! Does anyone know if TON has the functionality to send multiple NFTs from one address to another in one transaction?

Tim: kind of, but there's no benefit from gas standpoint

Ssi: you have to read the docs (reply to 13665)

Ssi: https://ton.org/ (reply to 13667)

Nikita: I‚Äôm not looking for benefit from gas standpoint. Just looking for all possible solutions to this issue (reply to 13660)

Saber: We had some use case that from UX side we needed multi nft transfer so we implemented some kind of NFT chaining transfer mechanism so the i-th nft will transfer its ownership and then tell the (i+1)-th nft of the list to transfer its ownership to some address( you need to check two things, first the owner of the i-th nft should be the same as the owner of (i+1)-th nft and also you need to check the validity of address of the nft(same as jetton wallet) (reply to 13672)

Tim: You can just use highload wallet

Daniil: You can send up to 4 internal messages at once from regular wallet if I'm not wrong (reply to 13672)

isoscele üíé: Does the standard nft contract has the ability to notify like that? I've never seen it (reply to 13673)

Saber: nope it‚Äôs not in standard nft contract, it‚Äôs a solution that we used for our game nft items to support multiple NFT stake with one transaction on our front-end (reply to 13676)

isoscele üíé: How do you check inside the nft item 2 that the sender nft item 1 belongs to the same owner? (reply to 13677)

Saber: nft item 1 sends two data to nft item 2 its token id: 1 in our case its owner: some address  so first of all, in nft item 2 we check if address of sender is compatible with the claimed token id which here is 1. so if this pass nft item 2 knows that this internal message truly comes from nft item 1 therefor now on we have trust that the owner address that nft item 1 claimed to have is true( because we wrote the logic of nft item) and now nft item 2 has to check one other thing that its owner is equal to the owner that nft item 1 gives (reply to 13679)

Narek: You can simply use high-load wallet for that kind of things. Another interesting approach is to create custom contract which stores all transfer messages in data cell and keep‚Äôs calling itself till all of them are sent, you can send up to ~1500 simple transfers that way. > 1500 is possible, but you would be unable to deploy contract via single message since there is 64kb limit for external messages size in network (reply to 13680)

davide: Hello guys, for you is possible to develop a stablecoin with jetton?

Narek: But i guess your approach is OK if you need mass-transfers but can‚Äôt force users to tie NFT‚Äôs to high-load wallet or some custom one (reply to 13680)

Saber: yeah, I don‚Äôt want regular users feel anything unusual, they should just select their NFTs and send a transaction with their normal wallet (reply to 13683)

Narek: This chat is not about selling nft and certainly not about selling nft‚Äôs in Ethereum (reply to 13685)

Dario: Nft manager(s) can communicate each others (reply to 13737)

Saber: use loadBits in tonweb

Saber: also use loadCoins instead of readCoins

Saber: yeah the next data in slice is address of sender and after that it‚Äôs forward payload

Saber: you read the from address incorrectly, it‚Äôs not loadUint use loadAddress I recommend you read a little about cell and the data formats in TON

Slava: Is there a special method to load the address? (reply to 13808)

Daniil: how ton-blockchain/stablecoin-contract is related to stablecoins? isn't it just a modification of Jettons with addition of admin functionality? why is it called stablecoin if it can be used for anything, not only stables? maybe it's better to call it something like "controllable jetton" or "administrable jetton"? or I misunderstood something from the repository

doni: from slice ? (reply to 13812)

doni: in general in func there is a primitive  loadMsgAddress   i suggest you look at the jetton contracts

doni: as for client side code ( typescript / javascript )   i would look at project such as minter

nick: How can i parse the message data?  in_msg -> message

Nick: In this case, you should parse msg_data.body as BOC according to this schema:  transfer_notification#7362d09c query_id:uint64 amount:(VarUInteger 16)                               sender:MsgAddress forward_payload:(Either Cell ^Cell)                               = InternalMsgBody;  const op = body.loadUint(32); // 0x7362d09c const query_id = body.loadUint(64);  const amount = body.loadCoins(); const sender = body.loadAddress(); const forwardPayload = body.loadBit() ? body.loadRef().beginParse() : body;  const comment = new TextDecoder().decode(forwardPayload.loadBits(forwardPayload.getFreeBits()));

Nick: Something like that.

Nick: const forwardPayload = body.loadBit() ? body.loadRef().beginParse() : body;

Nick: You should skip one bit before reading remaining bits.

Nick: 49 = 1 bit + 48 bits (6 symbols * 8 bit)

Nick: const text = new TextDecoder().decode(forwardPayload.loadBits(forwardPayload.getFreeBits())); (reply to 13852)

Tim: Depends on what you want to do. You can't write smart contracts in go and you can't write server side code with fift. You usually need both

Tim: So go is alternative to python/js, func you need to learn anyway

Tema: ah, so I can use other interpreted programming languages like Ruby or JVM based like Clojure for backend and funC/fift for smart-contracts? (reply to 13920)

Alex: Hello guys, there is a new Java library for TON development out there.  ton4j is Java JNA wrapper for Tonlib. It also includes many other helpful modules like BitString, Address, Cell, Mnemonic.  Out of the box, you will able to deploy wallets V1 (simple), V2 (multi-send), V3 (wallet-id), V4 (plugins) and other contracts like Jettons, NFTs –∏ DNS.  In documentation and tests there are lots of usage examples. Highload and payments contracts will come soon. Basically, ton4j is a port of tonweb, that's why you will find it very familiar. Feel free to report any bugs, contribute to the project via PRs, and post them here or on Github. https://github.com/neodiX42/ton4j

User<5126596027>: recv_internal just unpacks the initial stack int balance, int value, cell msg, slice msg_body. You don't have to take all values of the stack

Daniil: You can do that in two ways:  - parse all new blocks from workchain 0 and get transactions from them  - call the same "getTransactions" method with limit=100 or more and remove everything except workchain 0

Marat: There are several meanings of "successful":  - transaction created - meaning the external message was accepted by smart contract - transaction was executed successfully - meaning all transaction phases succeeded - transaction finalized - meaning it won't be reversed or changed Which of these you want to check? (reply to 14166)

Rasoul: https://tonapi.io/v1/dns/getInfo?name=gold.ton  I try  with this url  and get owner address but when serach in  https://tonscan.org/ can not find  address why?

Marat: It returns address in "raw" form, but tonscan accepts only "friendly" form. More details here. (reply to 14172)

Rasoul: i need script to convert (reply to 14173)

Coalus: https://ton.org/address/ Or via tonweb using js (reply to 14175)

Rasoul: This site does not convert hex to friendly? (https://ton.org/address/) (reply to 14176)

Francis: all of them (reply to 14171)

Francis: - transaction was executed successfully - meaning all transaction phases succeeded (reply to 14171)

Francis: how do i verify this

Dario: Hello, in new docs there is no page for asm instructions, right? I dont find it

Marat: You should parse transaction data (boc) and check the phases. Details here. Transaction structure here. On python to parse TX data you can use pytonlib.  Or you can rely on side effects of a successful transaction, such as receiver balance changed or tx has correct expected out_msgs. This can be obtained through ton-http-api. (reply to 14181)

Marat: Hi, there is one - https://ton.org/docs/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions (reply to 14183)

Dario: thanks! (reply to 14186)

Andrey: dton.io provide all information about phases and statuses, checkout any transaction, e.g. https://dton.io/tx/85A5844CC591A187C502D0D92314DCAED50277941DF0D1CCFA7FA87B45834E54?time=2022-11-22%2017:20:35 (reply to 14181)

–Ø: Good afternoon!That's the problem toncli can't find the fift even though it is there.

Andrey: Try remove doublequotes (‚Äù) (reply to 14190)

–Ø: Unfortunately this won't help(I've already tried) (reply to 14191)

&rey: Try using toncli on the same drive where fift is installed. (reply to 14190)

–Ø: I have them all on the c drive .I tried deleting, manipulations with moving files, etc.Func sees toncli at the same time

Francis: hi guyz how can i validate that a transaction is successful by hash?

Francis: - transaction was executed successfully - meaning all transaction phases succeeded

dStax: Hi guys, I was digging into this project and was wondering how the workchains and shardchains work. I see a lot of stuff about workchains being able to interact with the mainchain but what is the benefit of having these workchains and subchains. Thanks in advance for the help

talkol: Trezor is better than Ledger for anything except TON

ÁÑ°Áõ°ÁöÑÊú™‰æÜ: the dev of Trezor is lazy

User<5607333070>: I think he‚Äôs trying to ask how to listen to transactions on the ton network (reply to 14273)

User<5607333070>: not history

talkol: Lazy dev team is a good thing :) hardware wallet should not change. It‚Äôs a good wallet for Ethereum coins and Bitcoin (reply to 14279)

talkol: Ledger has some insanely bad decisions too, it‚Äôs not perfect  For example, passphrase has to be typed on the device using only 2 buttons which make people either avoid passphrase or take a short 4-6 character one which can easily be brute forced. Passphrase should always be used so then device doesn‚Äôt hold the full private key and it should be at least 14-15 characters so brute forcing it becomes difficult
