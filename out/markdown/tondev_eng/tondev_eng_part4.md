Saul: Hi all, can someone please confirm if I set up my own TON validator what the minimum and maximum native TON amount that can be staked per validator is?

Saul: looking to spin up a validator

Howard: 300k I remember (reply to 34800)

Saul: thanks and the maximum?

fomo: Hello Howard (reply to 34802)

Saul: also if the validator needs to self delegate?

Saul: Or can the full amount come from 1 delegator

&rey: 900k, as far as I remember. (reply to 34803)

&rey: Validator is able to run in single-nominator mode (so that owner of node owns all money) or be attached to nominator pool.

Saul: https://explorer.toncoin.org/config#configparam15  but this says 10m TON as the max?

&rey: Yes. The problem is that if validator tries to stake too much, the stake factor limits how much it actually stakes (maximal ratio of own stake / min validator stake). (reply to 34809)

Matan: Does that mean the 900k is variable depending on the stake of the smallest validator in the active set and the value used for stake factor? The config parameter set the max stake factor to 196608

Matan: Surely 196608*‚Äôthe min stake in the set‚Äô is significantly larger than 900k? (reply to 34811)

&rey: The factor is multiplied by 65536 to allow for granularity; effective factor is 196608/65536 = 3.

Matan: Ok so 900k being the max assuming the value of the minimum validator in the set is 300k?

Matan: If the smallest validator were to be 400k then the max effectiveness stake would be 1200k?

Matan: Also where is the 65536 value stored?

&rey: Elector's source code (https://tonscan.org/address/Ef8zMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM0vF#source), line 224. (reply to 34816)

Matan: Ok thanks so much for your help!

Matan: One more question: Given that the stake must be split so as to be active in both the odd and even pools, does the minimum/ maximum stake apply per validator or per pool? In ither words, to be active in both odd and even pools, must the stake in each pool be >300k and <900k?

CryptoTara: What function is used when someone nominates a stake to a validator ?

ŒëœÄœåŒªŒªœâŒΩ: Please tell me, in order for a validator to participate in the rounds, he must have 350 K TON on his balance. Pools can be created for nominators.. The documentation creates 2 pools, for even and odd rounds. Question: each pool must have 350K TON in total?? so that the validator can participate in the rounds or at least one of the two??

&rey: Each pool must have 350K in total (node owner + nominators). It's also possible to participate in half of validation rounds, using only one pool. (reply to 34825)

Justin: Hi All, is this the best place to get in touch with someone from the Developer relations team at TON?

Matan: Where does 350k come from? I thought the minimum is 300k in total including 10k from the validator operator if operating a nominator pool? (reply to 34826)

&rey: Actually, 300K doesn't guarantee that election chooses you as validator, 350K gives better chances. To get up to date information, you'd need to look at dashboard with list of validators [I don't remember its address]. (reply to 34829)

Tumin | Wagmi11: I am making a tx to a contract using ton-connect transactions how can I add additional comments to the tx so that it is also visible on the explorer? anybody has any idea about that?  I tried storing a slice on the message body but that doesn't work

Daniil: begin the body with 32 zero-bits and then the comment as UTF-8 string.  also if I remember correctly, in TON Connect you can simply pass a string to the body parameter instead of a cell. (reply to 34861)

Daniil: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/internal-messages#simple-message-with-comment

Tumin | Wagmi11: But I also have extra information in the tx,  I have to make a certain op code tx  if I have 32 zerobits it would converts the op to 0 (reply to 34862)

Daniil: then why do you need some comment in it if it's a service message to the contract? (reply to 34864)

Daniil: you can also try changing the logic of the contract to handle these text comments instead of opcodes, but it's not recommended way. (reply to 34864)

Tumin | Wagmi11: it would nice to see a comment on the explorer as well not required for the logical part

Matan: Any thoughts on this? (reply to 34842)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: because the second article states the conditions for inclusion in the tonvalidators.org list (reply to 34842)

Matan: They both seem to be defining the min stake for validator to be in the active setü§î (reply to 34869)

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: No, the minimum stake to create a pool is 1k coins. https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool/blob/main/func/new-pool.fif#L22 (reply to 34870)

Matan: Ok so if one were to create a pool with 1k it would work but would not be elected as the validator must stake 10k and the total nominated stake must exceed 300k?

Matan: Similarly if the total nominated stake were to be 500k but the validators only self staked 5k then it would not be eligible for election?

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: The elector doesn‚Äôt care what the validator‚Äôs stake is inside the pool. It is important for the elector what stake the pool sends to participate in the elections, and this value should be more than 300k coins (preferably 350k) It doesn‚Äôt matter how the pool collected coins - that the validator added 50k coins and the nominators 300k, that the validator added 1k and the nominators 349k

Matan: Ah ok so there is no requirement for a validator to selfstake?

‚ÄåJavad: Friends, I am a designer. If you have an order, I will be happy to do it. ü§ù

fomo: Hello guys, I don't quite understand how the contract storage work, why I can just store the value in the contract using set_data without specifiying the name of the variable, what if I have more than 1 varibles need to store in the contract storage? Also, when I am sening messageBody with cell data, can I just append unlimited number of storeUint in the cell?  Last but not least, is that anyway to kwon gas fee and ask users to pay for the transaction, cos unlike Ethereum, if users didn't pay enough gas, the transaction won't be done. But here on TON, the contract will pay the gas for computing.

&rey: 1. Contract storage is cell. 2. Cell stores 0-1023 bits and 0-4 references to other cells. 3. When you use several store_uint-s, you fill the cell, and once there's no more space, writing will fail.  4. Gas fees are usually calculated approximately and offchain. Also, a common practice is to send more TONs and return the excess. (reply to 34877)

What if I need to store the list together with the total deposited balance, what should I do? (reply to 34878)

&rey: > store a list of registered addresses in the smart contract and the deposited balance of each of them If there are more than 500 addresses, you should consider sharding the contract further. Otherwise, you can use dict.  begin_cell().store_dict(users).store_coins(total_balance).end_cell().set_data(); (reply to 34889)

Mr. Coder: HelIo everyone!  Does anyone have a ready script for checking tonProof on PHP after authorization using Ton Connect?

&rey: I don't. You can reimplement algorithm from Python (https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/integration#connection-using-tonproof). (reply to 34949)

idkravitz: sup, can someone tell me on how to watch tx lifecycle. I mostly interested in "sent", "complete" and "failed" states

&rey: Please note that TON transactions are entirely different from Ethereum ones. In TON, transaction happens in response to incoming internal or external messages (except for system contracts), and may include changing contract state or/and sending outgoing messages. (reply to 34951)

idkravitz: No, I mean the ones user sent from thier walletcontracts (reply to 34952)

idkravitz: I saw in tutorials a workaround with seqno, but it's unreliable in case of multiple txs

idkravitz: ok, but can I somehow determine that the message I sent was complete, failed or still pending? (reply to 34952)

&rey: You can lookup transaction by the incoming message. https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/transactions/get_try_locate_tx_tryLocateTx_get (reply to 34954)

&rey: By the way, in most cases you can locally emulate transaction to check whether it will fail or succeed.

&rey: (I'd recommend using https://www.orbs.com/ton-access/ interface for downloading contracts data then.)

idkravitz: yeah, but lets imagine I do a swap with fixed slippage, when I emulate it its fine, but by the time my message reaches the contract someone can frontrun me and my message/tx may fail

&rey: Then it's insufficient to check user's wallet and you should check if the desired action is complete. (reply to 34960)

idkravitz: in case of Ethereum I would see it in receipt. What can I do in TON besides calling the toncenter API?

idkravitz: thats right, how can I check that my action is complete for instance in ton/ton-core js libs (reply to 34961)

Denis: https://tonapi.io/api-v2 i think you should try this api (reply to 34962)

&rey: These libraries don't provide a way to interact with blockchain; you still need some API to query it, and there are several options including toncenter, dton, tonapi and some API (in development) implementing liteclient-in-browser. (reply to 34963)

idkravitz: k, but I saw some dapps that somehow show action/transaction lifecycle awareness in UI, for instance in ston.fi. How do they achieve it? They rely on 3rd party API? (reply to 34965)

&rey: Yes, they most probably do. Or they can route the queries through their backend. (reply to 34966)

idkravitz: so technically they aren't dapps :) (reply to 34967)

&rey: Are there dApps in Ethereum, or they still use some HTTP interface to interact with blockchain? (reply to 34968)

idkravitz: the simple ones, like, "mint my useless NFT" are pure dapps, they depend only on injected provider (reply to 34969)

idkravitz: anyway, thanks a lot, I thought I was really bad at googling the docs (reply to 34967)

&rey: That is, they rely on wallet application providing blockchain interface? I guess this can be done in TON as well, and can be a #HackTONberfest_idea. (reply to 34970)

idkravitz: oh, and the last one - is tact ready enough to write something like uniswap on ton?

idkravitz: because I really tempted to drop the learning of FunC due to how messy the contracts endup looking with it

idkravitz: sweet, I'll give it a shot

&rey: The problem with Tact is that it's really bad at working with maps. Uniswap doesn't need any, to my knowledge, so should work great.

idkravitz: yeah but basically the wallet application provides the same API as any public RPC node in a network, in other words any enpoint in ethereum. Thats a high degree of self-sufficiency, and one should use 3rd party indexers (like the Graph) only when he needs some kind of complex history aggregation. In most common cases endpoints API is enough. I hope the TON would adapt the same richness of endpoints API (reply to 34972)

&rey: Actually, that's not quite good because dApps ought to be usable without connecting wallet whenever possible. Also, if mobile wallet app is connected, it has to be always online to provide information from blockchain.

idkravitz: some dapps use a fallback provider when wallet isn't connected, its just a random endpoint of free known public endpoints (reply to 34978)

&rey: Orbs ton-access does exactly this, but these endpoints are also in ORBS DAO and punishable for misbehaviour. (reply to 34979)

&rey: I could agree with the idea that Telegram application should provide access to TON for internal webviews, though.

idkravitz: or its a dedicated endpoint of the respective company that runs dapp, which yet again can be classified as backend and render dapp to be a non dapp)

idkravitz: so in a case when company shutdowns their endpoint their dapp may become unusable, the same may happen if toncenter decide to shutdown their API or restrict it by political views or other policies

idkravitz: and being Russian I can totally relate to that)

I'm a fullstack but i've written smart contracts only with solidity this will be my first time using func. My idea is to have a smart contract handling this process: someone sends TON to my wallet and in exchange receives another TON based token. The amount is calucated with a use of a specific algorithm. Is there any example that implements something like this in the docs that i can learn from? Thanks a lot.

&rey: Actually, storage fees are small enough + contract needs to reach -0.1 TON to be frozen or -1 TON to be deleted. If jetton wallet gets to -1 TON, yes, corresponding jettons are lost. (reply to 35131)

&rey: As far as I remember, that would take at least a few months.

Ashish: What you call a ‚Äútonkeeper account‚Äù is a blockchain wallet. You can't delete it. No way. All you can do is press the logout button and forget about its existence (reply to 35172)

Daniil: Well, you can delete it by sending a message with mode 160 (reply to 35176)

Qwerty: I suspect that an outsider has login details, please tell me what I can do to keep me safe (reply to 35175)

Daniil: Create a new wallet and send all the funds and collectibles there (reply to 35178)

Qwerty: I understand you, thank you very much (reply to 35179)

Ashish: I haven't worked with blockchain as a developer, so please answer the question.  Does the tone blockchain allow you to clear the entire history of working with a wallet with one command send_raw_message? I doubt. I assume that it blocks the address or resets it. This is not equivalent to deleting your account. (reply to 35177)

Slava: Actually you can delete your wallet in tonkeeper settings (reply to 35172)

Daniil: Send mode 160 sends the whole balance and deletes all the data of a blockchain account. History may remain visible in explorers. (reply to 35181)

Ashish: That's what I'm talking about. What you call deletion is, in fact, not such. This is simply resetting the address while preserving the entire history of actionsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (reply to 35184)

Daniil: And how is this not deletion? (reply to 35185)

&rey: History isn't guaranteed to be saved for more than one week. Though, there are archive nodes which keep the full history of blockchain. (reply to 35185)

Ashish: All data associated with your wallet remains on the ton network. You simply lose the opportunity to use it. Almost the same thing as throwing out the seed phrase (reply to 35186)

Qwerty: Great, thanks (reply to 35183)

Daniil: The data is being deleted. The history may remain on the historical nodes. In case with regular wallet smart contracts -> you'll still be able to use it by simply activating the wallet once again. And for custom contract, it'll lose the code and data. (reply to 35189)

Ashish: We dont talk about custom smart contracts) I will try to convey my idea as simply as possible. I have a database. I select the entry. I enter the DELETE command. This entry no longer exists. At all. This is called deletion. I have a blockchain. I choose an address. I am sending a command send_raw_message from it. The wallet continues to exist. This is not called deletion. (reply to 35191)

Daniil: Wallet doesn't continue to exist after sending a message with mode 160. Until someone deploys it again. (reply to 35192)

Aydin: And now I have a question: does this "Delete account" option in Tonkeeper do the same thing as sending a message with mode 160, as @Gusarich explains? (reply to 35183)

Slava: As far as I know, yes, it sends msg with 128 + 32 mode (reply to 35195)

Tim: No??? (reply to 35196)

Slava: No? (reply to 35197)

Tim: Where does it send money then?

Aydin: Crucial question! (reply to 35199)

Tim: It's really not

Slava: Well, think someone should check it in testnet

Tim: It just doesn't delete anything on blockchain

Aydin: As this menu shows, seems that it actually deletes money? (reply to 35202)

Anton: money is on the blockchain, it's not deleted.  It's like you're just throwing the key from your safe into a volcano. Valuables are still in safe but no one can open it  [P.S. looks like I'm wrong] (reply to 35204)

Daniil: you can (reply to 35205)

Daniil: ^ (reply to 35191)

Tim: You are asking about that for hour already. Creating new account and testing takes 10 minutes

Aydin: Oh sorry for that üôà (reply to 35210)

Tim: You don't need to be sorry. It's just ineffective and we already answered question

Justin: How are keys stored at rest through TON?

Daniil: What do you mean? (reply to 35218)

Aydin: I just tried to verify your point. Not to flood here, but to clarify things for other newcomers like myself:  üü°  I created a wallet on testnet and put some coins in it. Then, tried to delete the account on Tonkeeper Web. Also, imported the wallet on the mobile app and tried to delete the account there. And during the whole process, controlled the status via tonscan. Even when both wallets were deleted, I was able to send some amount to that address successfully, and the transaction was visible in tonscan.  ‚û°Ô∏è  Result: In all cases, the wallet was deleted APPARENTLY ONLY FROM THE LOCAL DEVICE. No change was observed on the blockchain (via tonscan).  ‚û°Ô∏è  Conclusion.  Actually, I couldn't distinguish (with certainty) between this behavior of the "delete account" option in Tonkeeper and that of "sending a message with mode 160," which, as @Gusarich explained, modifies the data on-chain (which is still vague for me as I haven't experimented it yet).  Perhaps I had to wait for, say, more than 1 week to observe different results? Most notable of all was the ability to send money to the wallet even after deletion which is an indicative of the active state of the wallet.  PS: To get a clearer picture, I tried to search any kind of delete command within ton-blockchain.github.io/docs, but I couldn't spot the relevant material unfortunately. Also, looked at https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/messages#message-modes which describes mode 160. Here, it seems that mode 160 must be something different from "delete account" in Tonkeeper. (reply to 35197)

Anthony: Nope. As I know it was Apple‚Äôs request to have a ‚Äúdelete account‚Äù button ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (reply to 35195)

Daniil: Trust wallet doesn‚Äôt have such option ü§î (reply to 35222)

Eugene: ü§î  Not sure how does that work (reply to 35223)

Aydin: Now, after my experiment with Tonkeeper, I guess this too, must operate on the local device only? (reply to 35224)

Aydin: A reasonable suggestion for wallet makers could be to change the text of their "Delete account" buttons to something like "Delete account on this device" to avoid confusion

ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ: i want to get connected to a contract with react, how can i do that ?

Slava: hi! maybe someone here have experience how to modify wallet connection modal in @tonconnect/ui-react library? What is the best approach to add some custom button to this modal?

&rey: I think the best way is to add the files with modal to your project and fix them there. (reply to 35234)

Ray: Hi which library is the best for smart contracts in ton python?

Tumin | Wagmi11: https://github.com/psylopunk/pytonlib https://github.com/XaBbl4/pytonconnect  I suggest this (reply to 35236)

Maxwell: Suppose my message call order is like External World -> Contract A -> Contract B -> Contract C: 1. Would the messages be build into one block or possiblely into multiple blocks? 2. what if the last message call(B->C) failed, how could the state of Contract A and B be reverted?  Can anyone explain it to me? Still confused about the messaging mechanism in TON.

Tumin | Wagmi11: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/message-delivery-guarantees  hope this helps (reply to 35238)

Daniil: 1. They can possibly be split into several blocks (especially if the contracts are in different shards)  2. When a transaction fails, it bounces a message back to the sender, so that smart contract can handle the error case (reply to 35238)

Tumin | Wagmi11: https://t.me/tontech/80 (reply to 35236)

Maxwell: So it's not quite feasible to build latency/state sensitive cross-contract applications in TON, right? Like DeFi?

Daniil: It‚Äôs all possible, just can be a little bit harder to architect (reply to 35242)

Daniil: I think the only thing we can‚Äôt have here are flash loans

Maxwell: For case 2, the bounced message might get back to contract A a few blocks later, which leads to my contract A state inconsistent for short period?  Put it in another way, the exception handle logic would guarantee TON blockchain to achieve eventual consitency. (reply to 35240)

Maxwell: Yes, quite tricky to reason about the logic for me now. (reply to 35243)

Daniil: State may change by other transactions while the bounced one travels back. Same for the regular messages that contracts send to each other. (reply to 35245)

&rey: Generally, you need reentrancy consistency guarantees. Eth contracts also require them, but sometimes developers just use workarounds like a lock. (reply to 35245)

&rey: So, the state of your contract should be consistent at any time.

Maxwell: Not expect flashloan magic in TON, but would like to build complex DeFi Lego upon it, so it leads me to above questions. (reply to 35244)

Maxwell: Take  jetton tranfer as a example, Jetton-wallet-A reduced by 10 jettons at logic time n, while Jetton-wallet-B failed for some wired reason(Like blacklisting A), but before the bounced message be handled at logic time n+3(3 blocks later) and revert A's balance. Between logic time n to n+2, the state of A is not quite consistent right? (reply to 35248)

&rey: The state is consistent, as it doesn't allow to do any unexpected operation. Until transfer "fully failed", including that jettons returned, user shouldn't be able to use those sent jettons for anything else. (reply to 35251)

Maxwell: I get it.  Before A get the response message from B, contract A is locked preventing from further state operation, right?

&rey: You can do that, but it's not a best practice. (reply to 35253)

&rey: Jetton wallet, for instance, allows to send any jettons remaining on balance (in particular because it doesn't expect response on successful transfer).

&rey: And bounced message with K jettons just adds K jettons to balance.

Maxwell: Yes, but if some other contract try to read the my Jetton-wallet-A between logic time n, n+1, n+2, it would get the wrong balance, doesn't it? Only after n+3, the reverted operation would correct the A's balance.

&rey: That's why there is no way to call get-methods of other contracts. (reply to 35257)

&rey: This pattern is called "value-carrying messages": some part of jettons are stored not inside contracts but inside messages between them.

Daniil: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/get-methods#invoking-get-methods-from-other-contracts

Maxwell: It's like two POSTs between contracts instead of one GET to exchange state info.  Still not quite clear about the implication of async feature for complicated multi-contract applications, but very appreciate for your help. Gonna dive deeper. (reply to 35259)

Mahdi: Hello guys. I was wondering we have any ERC20 tokens in Ton network?

Daniil: Yes, but you usually don‚Äôt need such actions (reply to 35261)

Daniil: Jettons (TEP-74 standard) (reply to 35262)

Ivan: Hello there! Have Somebody issues with NextJs 13+ (AppRouter) when update language option via setOption hook from tonconnect ui?

Daniil: What kind of states do you need to read from your smart contract?  Here you usually need to spend some time designing architecture of smart contracts so that they will work efficiently in asynchronous and distributed environment of TON blockchain. It‚Äôs harder than on synchronous chains, but it allows TON to scale almost infinitely (reply to 35267)

r4mze5: Hello guys, why don't I get different addresses when importing the wallet that created the TON SDK? Tried all versions

Mahdi: Thanks Daniil (reply to 35264)

User: https://pastebin.com/kJb0JXya  Hello. I have a trouble in cell with long message. I using this contract as sample for creating mine: https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/tsc4/blob/main/contracts/4.fc  In sample contract it already receive full message which set in tuple and then using var text it set headers in tuple. In my case, I have dynamic text which creating using loop, how i can put headers there, if I don't know full message in the beginning?   p.s. Maybe it's possible to convert tuple to message and then use it.

Mateusz | Nethermind: In the docs it says: If you are running a validator in the "mainnet", it is a good idea to use more sophisticated wallet smart contracts (e.g., a multi-signature wallet).  Are there any known validators using msg? Seen only v3 wallets being used as per MyTonCtrl defaults.

User<6247944943>: how do we pop the emit log in test?  using @ton-community/sandbox"

Tim: It's wrong argument. We can't use get methods not because they're useless. There are a lot of cases, when such calls can greatly reduce contract complexity. But it's not possible in ton because of sharding architecture.  To call get method on contract A from contract B, validator needs to know exact state of both of them and acquire lock. But it's not always possible, because contract A can be on different shard from contract B and validator of contract A may not even know state of contract B, let alone acquire any locks. It's a tradeoff that allows scalability, but changes way you interact between contra ts. @bitrocks01 (reply to 35270)

Mujahid: how to deploy this script to be able to transfer tokens to multiple addresses

Mujahid: how can i access my token because my token is deployed on ton blockchain

Mujahid: is i include my token address in this script or not

Mujahid: or private key etc like these things

&rey: 1. Private key instead of await mnemonicNew(). 2. No need to include your own address.

Daniil: You can do the same on front end (reply to 35432)

Fly: for example, how to get Address? Is there a CDN for ton-core js library? (reply to 35433)

&rey: You can use some build system (rollup?), for example. (reply to 35435)

Fly: so there is no way I can use it like web3.js? (reply to 35436)

&rey: CDN also exists: https://unpkg.com/browse/ton-core@0.52.0/ (reply to 35435)

Fly: thank you I will try that out

Fly: Does anyone know if there is any example of myAppExplorerService?

Fly: I am actually looking for a way to check the status of my transaction, my smart contract will emit a log and I would like to read the logged message. But I have no idea how to make that happen and I cannot find any related documentation

&rey: You may have a look at an example that loads contracts interacting with certain address, checks their code and loads data: https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ton-stable-timer/blob/master/web-interface/src/lib/load_timers.ts (reply to 35441)

Fly: thank you I will check that out (reply to 35442)

Fly: is toncenter official? (reply to 35442)

&rey: Yes, but you should use @orbs-network/ton-access because it doesn't have rate limits. (reply to 35444)

Fly: so TonWeb and Tonconnect serve the same purpose?

&rey: TonWeb+tonweb-mnemonic is similar to ton-core+ton. (reply to 35446)

Fly: I see, and TonWeb is under Toncenter so it is also official, am I correct?

If you want code to be unchanged from EQB2NJFK0H5OxJTgyQbej0fy5zuicZAXk2vFZEDrqbQ_n5YW, copy it from https://tonscan.org/address/EQB2NJFK0H5OxJTgyQbej0fy5zuicZAXk2vFZEDrqbQ_n5YW#source ‚Äî bytecode ‚Äî base64 and paste into the top field of deployer. 2. If you have specific data output by multinft.py, copy it into the bottom (second) field of deployer. 3. Then, press the button to deploy and scan the QR in Tonkeeper/some wallet (testnet should also work, but not sure). (reply to 35449)

User<1250942880>: I did all that after scan QR code what is next step it required to send balance of test TON then after I send balance no thing happen that the problem (reply to 35458)

&rey: Afterwards, your contract is deployed... can you send the address of wallet from which you send the deploy message? (reply to 35459)

&rey: This seems like issue with parsing command line arguments. I don't remember how I worked around that. (reply to 35480)

Falco: Opening lite-client and doing the command there works.  Running lite-client with the -c flag for the getaccount doesn't work :(

&rey: Wait. The other chat suggests using the full path /usr/bin/ton/lite-client/lite-client. (reply to 35451)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Import wallet by private key from mhpba  Hi there,  I've been using the Atomic wallet to store my TON tokens. Unfortunately, I've encountered an issue where it won't allow me to send my assets and displays an error message stating, "Block explorer is currently unavailable." I've tried various methods and even reached out to their support team for assistance, but my problem persists.  As you may know, you have access to your private key in your atomic wallet. However, the private key for TON wallet on Atomic wallet is a lengthy 128-character base, while most wallets that support private key imports typically use a 64-character base, such as Trust Wallet and Safepal.  My question is, are there any wallets that support the import of a wallet using a 128-character private key? Or do you have any suggestions to help me resolve this issue?

Fantasy: Hello ‚úåÔ∏è I'm a smart contract & frontend design & developer. I can build up token contract and marketing site by my self and also I can do smart contracts for DeFi and NFT projects. Please let me know if you have any ideas to build your own project. Thank you.

User<5754825052>: Yes, it is possible to connect messages from Ethereum to the Ton network, but you need to use a special bridge that allows the exchange of tokens between the two chains. One of the most reliable and easy to use bridges is the official Ton bridge, which supports the transfer of WETH, USDT, DAI and WBTC from Ethereum to Ton. To use this bridge, you just have to follow these steps:  - Navigate to the official Ton bridge website and connect your blockchain wallet. - Click on the 'Bridge' section to access the Ton bridge interface. - Choose 'TON' as your destination chain and select the asset you want to move. - Enter the amount you want to transfer and click on 'Approve' to initiate the transaction. - Enter your Ton wallet address as the recipient, then finalize the process to complete the bridging of your assets to the Ton network.  Please note that this bridge may have costs associated with Ethereum gas fees, which can be high depending on the time. You should also make sure you have a Ton-compatible wallet to receive your tokens. (reply to 35669)

Flex: Hi, all, for the wallet address can I consider the user-friendly address and bounceable address to be equivalent when used?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: user-friendly means "not raw", and user-friendly may be in bounceable and unbounceable format. if [destination] wallet is deployed then no matter which one you use, but for not-yet-deployed wallet you would like to use unbounceable one (reply to 35731)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: I guess it will be in non-bounceable form (UQ...) Check all forms of your  address at https://ton.org/address/ (reply to 35733)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: "bounceable" mean that when you have incoming transfer, but your wallet is not deployed - transfer will return back to sender. If your wallet is deployed - no matter which form (bounc on non-bounc) you use, incoming transfer will stay on your adderss

Behrang: Hey üëã Is there any standard for assigning names to transaction op-codes, to be displayed in TON explorers?

Behrang: I think a get-method in each contract can help here.

User<6059051896>: Hello,I'm actively looking for a project   Version control system  -Git Programming and markup language  -C#,JS,TS,Python,fullstack  Development Environments -Visual Code,Visual Studio  Framework and Libraries  -Reacts.Js -Vue.Js -Asp.net -WPF -Windows Forms  Auxiliary tools -Figma -Trello  API -Rest/JSON

&rey: Hello! There is, defined by TL-B standard https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/tl-b-language#constructors. > If a tag is not explicitly provided, the TL-B parser must compute a default 32-bit constructor tag by hashing with CRC32 algorithm the text of the ‚Äúequation‚Äù with | 0x80000000 defining this constructor in a certain fashion. (reply to 35804)

Behrang: I didn't phrase it correctly. Here I try once more:  In explorers, in front of each tx, an op code is displayed, which is 8 hex digits. This is not readable.   Specific opcodes like jetton or nft show the operation name instead. This makes them more readable.   I want to define these names for my smart contract, so that when anyone visits the explorer and opens one of these contracts, views readable operation names instead of opcodes. (reply to 35807)

&rey: You need to reach out to explorers' authors for that. (reply to 35808)

Behrang: I thought devs of multiple explorers might be here and have an idea on that.

Andrey: We need to develop ABI for smart contracts, which will do that.   But it's not quite easy task, and there's no active discussion currently (reply to 35810)

Luke: how do i send arbitrary messages to a contract

‚Äî 2023-10-09 ‚Äî

&rey: The interface for that is called "wallet". (reply to 35815)

Behrang: You're the expert here, but to keep the discussion active, how about this:  Currently explorers show the Jetton balance of an smart contract if it is TEP74. And it looks like they update the balance quite frequently.  - Another TEP could decide on the standard.  - (1) One idea is that this get method is named, for example, get_opcode_names and returns a dictionary mapping 32bit op codes to short strings. It also might have a limit of at most, let's say, 100 entries.  - (2) Another idea is that this get method is named, for example, get_opcode_name and returns a short string when given an opcode as argument.  - (3) The next idea is that each smart contract can send a message to a specific address with a specific opcode. In the message body, there can be a dictionary mapping these opcodes to short string names. Explorers can look for the last message from this smart contract to that specific address and use those names for opcodes. This way, smart contract developers can send that message, whenever they want to update the opcode names.  - In the options above, there is the problem of caching. For how long should they be cached? When and how should they be invalidated and what if a name changes?  - The next step after showing opcode names, is showing values for other parameters in the message along with their name. How about just returning a TLB scheme instead of a short name string, so that explorers can also show other parameters, for example, in details of each transaction. (reply to 35811)

Behrang: The option (3) has the problem that child smart contracts must also send a message to the address, which makes it unfeasible. In the case of child smart contracts, op-codes can be looked up from parent smart contract.  For example, jetton wallets have get_wallet_data which identifies their parent. In this case, op-code names can be delegated to parent, i.e. jetton master. (reply to 35817)

Thilak: hi,   Is the tonweb node module compatible only with node js or its allowed with react js too?

Sleapy: Hi, I'm new here and I am struggling with decoding/encoding a TLB scheme: https://docs.dedust.io/reference/tlb-schemes#asset this one.  native$0000 = Asset; jetton$0001 workchain_id:int8 address:uint256 = Asset; extra_currency$0010 currency_id:int32 = Asset;  I'm trying to encode Asset and use it to query methods from the DeDust smart contracts for testing purposes. For example: 'get_vault_address' in the factory contract: https://docs.dedust.io/reference/factory who take a 'slice' of Asset.  I don't really know how to encode this properly. if I understand, for Native coin (TON) I just have to encode 4 bits ("0000") and that'is. If I want to encode a Jetton, I store 4 bits ("0001") then I store a int8 (0 for the workchain) then a uint256 (so I guess the uint256 representation of the hexadecimal address ?  But everything I try does not work. I am sure I am missing a simple piece of the puzzle but I don't know what right now

Sleapy: If I try to query it through tonapi.io or TonViewer I have exit code : 7 most of the time (reply to 35835)

&rey: What get method are you calling? Also, get methods don't usually require encoding inputs. (reply to 35835)

Sleapy: 'get_vault_address' (reply to 35838)

Sleapy: but since it requires a "slice" type i thought it would be the encoded Asset type

&rey: You can see an example at https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/wallet-contract/blob/main/basic-interaction-wallet-inplug-v1.ts. (reply to 35842)

5: Why can‚Äôt I send the transaction?

5: I want to transfer a transaction. Do I need to perform any other operations after executing the code?

&rey: The most probable reason is invalid seqno, the second one is too low value (you need to set sendMode = 3 to pay for gas from sender's wallet). (reply to 35844)

&rey: await wallet.methods.transfer(...).send(); (reply to 35844)

5: Where is sendMode actually set?

Howard: you can get the emit log data as the String looks like this from API(eg. TonAPI).  Then decoded it based on your message formate you set before. (reply to 35831)

&rey:   seqno: 0,   sendMode: 3,   ... (reply to 35850)

5: LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot apply external message to current state : Failed to unpack account state

&rey: Could you show the full error log? Opcodes (THROWIFNOT) are the most important part. (reply to 35853)

User<5660798371>: he's got an inactive wallet (reply to 35862)

User<5660798371>: you must execute this code before sending the first transaction. (reply to 35856)

&rey: Not needed, I think. TonWeb should deploy wallet automatically when seqno is 0. (reply to 35872)

5: Sent, thank you very much (reply to 35873)

&rey: 1. You need to add 1 to seqno each time an outgoing transaction is sent. 2. You've sent invalid payload; the correct one would be payload: TonWeb.boc.Cell.oneFromBoc(TonWeb.utils.base64ToBytes("te6cc...")). 3. Smart contracts can't process incoming messages with 1 nanoTON of value. (reply to 35874)

5: Thank you for helping me solve the problem too (reply to 35872)

5: Where is the document requesting key settings?

Sleapy: So do you know the answer ? I already tried to simply put the token address, it give me a cell but if I deserialize it the vault address is incorrect. (reply to 35838)

Fly: Thanks (reply to 35851)

Fly: Anyone know the solution of this? I cannot wait till the send is done even though I put an ‚Äúawait‚Äù in front of it (reply to 35834)

&rey: Maybe myContract?. causes the problem? Can you make it always non-null? (reply to 35834)

Fly: I tried to remove the ? and added an if(myContract) before calling that (reply to 35882)

Fly: But the await still doesn‚Äôt work

Fly: The code run the next line regardless of the myContract.send

&rey: Ah, you want to wait until transactions are complete. Actually, meaning of this highly depends on context and thus waiting isn't implemented in libraries; await only waits until the external message is sent to wallet. (reply to 35886)

Fly: do u have any example on how to get the string using API? (reply to 35851)

Fly: Like what should I input to get the corresponding data

Howard: can't understand tho (reply to 35890)

Some people also referenced their questbook proposal in Github issue proposal. And questbook redirects some people to Github. It is where this becomes confusing.

Ruslan: Hi guys sorry for a silly question, it is coorect that TON smart contract programming language is TACT?

Coalus: You can use fift, func, rift, Tact, ton-solidity to create smart contracts on TON (reply to 35973)

Ruslan: OMG, 4 languages, and which language i used in the ton wallet to send transactions, maybe you now ? (reply to 35974)

Denis: Really only funC :) (reply to 35975)

Ruslan: But then why other languages are needed, very unusual 1 blockchain 4 languages...?

Denis: Fift - is very native for ton but not friendly for developers who doesn't have experience with esoteric languages. First ton language. Tact - very friendly and perspective but creates too expensive code now. Maybe in the future. Solidity - alternative made by everscale team. It compatible with ton, but nobody uses it. Maybe few marginal developers

Ruslan: thanks Denis, maybe you now where to find docs and materials about Fift?

Currently, if the metadata is not parsed correctly, the token is shown as an unknown token. Any assistance or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Maxey: I am currently writing code to deploy a Jetton Master within a contract, but the content can't be parsed by the TON viewer at the moment, resulting in it being displayed as an unknown token.

Maxey: Why have to storeUint(1,1) first?

Daniil: Because dict is basically a MaybeRef structure. So you first store one bit indicating whether the dict is empty or not, and then if it‚Äôs not, the dict itself in a reference (reply to 36005)

Alexander: Hi guys, is there any caching service for TON to quickly pull data into frontend? I realize that just calling contract getters via SDK would be ineffective for page load time, and backend caching is also a compromise.

Daniil: You should do storeUint(1, 1). Not int. (reply to 36008)

Daniil: Or you can use storeInt(-1, 1) for the same effect

Denis: Also interesting. Tonplay wanted to make new standard for SFT but it was very bad. And really they just wanted to change display style for tokens.

Denis: But we can make in ton erc-1155 analogue. Mostly like current jetton implementation but with few assets inside one jetton wallet and jetton master. It can't be adopted for NFTs, but for jettons can work.

Howard: I think we need ERC1155 feature.    This solution need Getgems.io or NFT Marketplace support (reply to 36087)

Denis: I don't see any sense in merging jettons and NFTs in one contract.  And how do you see it for NFTs?

Denis: For jettons it easy. Just a map with few jettons inside. It will not have constant gas price for transfer, but it can't grow unlimited because number of available jettons limited by master contract.

Denis: For NFTs I think better to add analogue of erc721enumerable for storing all items in one collection.

Denis: This solution doesn't have unlimited scalability but 99% of NFTs doesn't need it

Howard: I think I will put SFT like multiple-Jetton Token contracts structure, but having the a different Field

There are 2 strategies to avoid it: 1. Find a good short name. It will be too expensive for someone else to bid over just for speculation. 2. Find a few similar names that look just as good, and mint them first. If someone is trying to steal them, they can have them.

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Quiz 6 from FaizanM  What makes TON a game changer in competition with numerous Layer 1 competitors is its synergy with Telegram. ?  This is because it is tailored to . One of the biggest concerns in the crypto industry is public penetration, that is, making blockchain-based services penetrate the public's daily lives.  üîó Answer on TON Overflow

Ruslan: /api/v2 service (called ton-http-api) wraps tonlib c++ library: each request goes directly to LiteServer (or sometimes executes inside tonlib)  /api/index service indexes whole blockchain in traditional databases  (sql in our case) and querying data from this database instead of blockchain.  Indexer has more data aggregating and filtering features and could response faster than ton-http-api service, meanwhile it is more difficult to setup and maintain.  From the other side, ton-http-api takes data directly from blockchain and checks proofs. Therefore it is more reliable than indexer service. (reply to 36227)

User<95392270>: üî¥The TON Believers Fund (TBF), has emerged as a non-profit organization consisting of international communities dedicated to the TON ecosystem. This fund is governed by a tailor-made smart contract designed for its specific purpose.  The core objective and aim of the fund is to appeal to prominent TON holders, early miners, and projects willing to support the community by locking their funds for an extended 5-year period.  The unique smart contract empowers any $TON holder to secure their tokens for 5 years, with an initial 2-year lock-up and a subsequent 3-year vesting period. Moreover, TBF has gained significant support from various key projects.  This initiative has garnered support from the TON Foundation, following a successful vote within the community and by validators on http://ton.vote. The TON Foundation has allocated 1,000,000 TON to the fund's reward pool.  For up-to-date TBF statistics, interested parties can refer to the following links: DefiLlama Tonscan Tonviewer  For guidance on contributing to the fund, a detailed guide is available here.

Creature: Oh~ Ok. Thanks.

Creature: Then how can I send jetton?

Creature: Hope you provide me the code.

&rey: The code is almost correct! You just need to figure out how many TON you want to send to destinationAddress and send a bit (+0.2 TON) more in amount: '...'. (reply to 36560)

AYMEN: Can i safely depend in in_msg.value as how amount of TON i received? Can other types of transactions affect it? a.k.a the value isn't about the amount of TON.

freedom: It's so slow to get balance. Is there any way to make it faster?

Oleg: It looks like you are using tonutils-go.  On the first init of client it fetches full chain of proofs, it takes some time. You can init client once per service and use it for every lite server calls, it will be fast after first fetching.  Alternatively you can turn off proof chain check, by passing Fast proof check policy (reply to 36761)

freedom: ok

Oleg: https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/master/example/wallet/main.go#L34   if you don't need a proofs chain, but still want simple proofs you may change here to ton.ProofCheckPolicyFast

Behrang: I've found a workaround, sharing it here in case anyone hit the same problem.  Problem If you have a get method that uses network configs, using lite-client to call it will return an error.   Workaround on client environment Use ton-access with v2 client, v4 will throw the same error. It looks like that v2 uses tonlib, while v4 uses lite-client internally.  Workaround on server environment Use tonlib-cli instead of lite-client. (reply to 34316)

Can it provide a link that carries the recipient's address, transfer amount, and a comment, allowing for a direct redirection from my web app to Ton Space's transfer page without the need to connect a wallet in advance?

Aber: Is there no direct redirect link like Tonkeeper, e.g. directly redirect to: https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/EQDVJrXsScRIS1vvVZlxj9ogKgC39qwGimxXJsONc-pPvoQ5?jetton=EQCbKMTmEAdSnzsK85LOpaDkDH3HjujEbTePMSeirvEaNq-U&amount=1000000000&text=aaaabbbb

Gunnar: Have I got this right? Discovering all holders of a particular jetton isn't very easy?   I can look at ALL transactions for all of time and look for Jetton Internal Transactions.   Or I can look at initial minting transfers from the master contract to some wallet, and "follow the money" along other transfers from those wallets?

Yulian: Hey folks! Does anyone run archive node? Do u have any troubles after v2023.10 release? I can't understand why I can't run node properly, it always crashing

Igor: Hi everyone!  We are developing a TON-based project that represents a set of rebase tokens. Along the way, we discovered that it is currently impossible to implement such tokens in TON architecture with the existing Jetton standard. So, we propose a new Rebase-Jetton standard.   We have documented all of our investigations of the problem and proposed standard in a separate Medium article: https://united-finance.medium.com/overview-of-ways-to-implement-rebase-tokens-on-ton-blockchain-3e23552cf0b3  We have also raised a corresponding bounty task: https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/342  Please join the discussion, especially if you develop rebase-based projects, DApps, services, or DeFi protocols that this standard will interact with if it is approved.

Tse: Hi, I'm wondering if the address of a smart contract is calculated based on its own code,  and when the contract is mutable even after deployment, what will happen when we change the code? Does its address change accordingly?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: no, address will not change (reply to 36968)

&rey: Address is based on StateInit. (reply to 36968)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: there was a special "empty" contract and console tool to find vanity address (by changing meaningless random init variable), then you deploy this contract (to address found) and then you update code of this contract to your conract code, so you'll   have your contract with vanity address

Tse: oh right. I forgot about that part. But what if, say: 1. I deploy a contract 2. Modified the contract 3. The contract ran out of TONCOIN for storage fee 4. (I suppose) the nodes remove the contract from their storage Then is there a way to recover the contract? I thought the recovery was done by re-uploading the contract's bytecode and calculate  the address to see if it matches the old one. But seems like I was wrong? (reply to 36970)

Tse: Or is the part that will change the StateInit immutable?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: i guess you'll need to re-upload initial contract (to get same address as before) and then re-modify it again.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I mean the testnet should be workchai_id = 0.

Denis: because you should read about ton architecture

Denis: mainnet and testnet are not workchains. both mainnet and testnet has masterchain and basechain inside

Denis: masterchain it something like beacon chain in ethereum

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Okay, thank you. I admit that I didn't understand the document because it's in English, and I'm not very proficient in reading English. Moreover, translation tools often don't provide accurate translations. Maybe I should dedicate some time to read the document more thoroughly.

Denis: Testnet.tonapi.io can submit transaction

Denis: And parsing URL is better to make locally because it just a base64 <-> hex conversion

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: It‚Äôs ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù in general. User provided his address as string in some form (bounceable/not). Some program used that address and made a message. Program may set bounce flag explicitly, so flag in tx is not required to be equal to ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Form of address (bounce/not) is just a visual representation. Both resolves to same raw address.

Rahul: i need to call individually. but it took 3 seconds. is there any way we can boost it?

&rey: 1. Modify the contract so that it returns all three values from a single get-method. 2. Use sandbox with real blockchain provider, so that contract is downloaded once and then you only call get-methods on local copy.

Rahul: can we modify it? its already deployed

Rahul: but i am using it on mainnet. and contract already deployed on mainnet. (reply to 37142)

&rey: In disassembled code, there is no recv_external. (reply to 37169)

sdw: and in this case how could someone possibly transfer funds there? (reply to 37170)

&rey: By sending a message from wallet. (reply to 37171)

sdw: I did send fine using MyTonWallet. But when I try to transfer using my code it throws the error mentioned

&rey: You probably want to send external message to your wallet to order it to transfer funds to the contract. (reply to 37173)

sdw: do you have an example :)  ‚ò∫Ô∏è

&rey: However, if you don't understand contract mechanics, you probably should not do this.

sdw: yeah

&rey: So, how many? (reply to 37179)

sdw: you are asking about the seqno?  the transaction stracture? (reply to 37180)

&rey: The transactions. (reply to 37181)

&rey: Nope. What happens when you send money to other contract?

sdw: You want me to explain message delivery for TON? (reply to 37184)

&rey: On a bit higher level: what messages are there and what transactions will be done. (reply to 37185)

sdw: you call method funds delivered (reply to 37184)

sdw: You send message calling a function from a smart contract, smart contract replies back. In TON inbound message is trigered and sets the outbound (reply to 37186)

&rey: Not precisely so.  You send external message to your wallet. There is transaction on your wallet, processing the message, accepting it and sending the funds. So your wallet sends internal message to the second one.  There is transaction on the second wallet; for v4r2, it ensures that the message doesn't need processing. (reply to 37188)

&rey: In total, there are 2 messages and 2 transactions.

For more details about this collaboration, read this article. (forwarded from TON Community)

User<1658592266>: I don't understand why you need to build a bridge to the "still healthy" blockchain for all the compromised volume of scams in the DeFi segment?  Why is it still not possible to transfer tokens from TON to ETH and BSC???  This would allow the collection of huge liquidity that exists in these networks and then guide the holders of wrapped tokens into truly functional products based on TON!  Instead, you're just setting up those who believe in TON)))  If I'm missing something, please explain. (reply to 37369)

Aram: The opposite direction (from TON to others) is in development right now.  I don‚Äôt see your point. We have a mission on enabling connectivity between networks and we do it.   We don‚Äôt label blockchains. We just make sure that they are connected. (reply to 37372)

User<1658592266>: I'm not insinuating anything)))   I'm genuinely curious as to why currently all solutions, including the official TON bridge, work in one direction only (with the exception of Toncoin and a few other tokens). (reply to 37373)

User<1658592266>: I really wouldn't want the DeFi market of the TON blockchain to turn into the same dumpster of relentless scams as in ETH or BSC‚Ä¶  Is anyone seriously considering solutions to secure this market?  I understand that anonymity is the cornerstone of the technology, but implementing a mechanism to protect unqualified investors from scams will be necessary. Otherwise, mass adoption is out of the question! (reply to 37373)

Aram: The opposite direction is in development right now. In 1-2 weeks we will launch it. (reply to 37374)

Sam: Is it possible to just participate in every other consensus round with 300k TON, instead of needing 600kTON to participate continuously?  Also, is there a maximum amount of total stake on a node? I see all the top validators have the same amount of staked TON.

Chimit: Hi! can anybody explain why Tailwind classes work when I open my web app in the browser but don't when it's opened in Telegram?

Aydin: Hi all. I'd like to know how to convert 64 hex private keys back into mnemonics. For example, here:  https://answers.ton.org/question/1620783559922946048/  @pcrafter has replied:  "It should be possible to cut off the last half of key (64 HEX characters), which is actually public key, and use the rest in other wallets."  Now, suppose that I have done the above cutoff, and next, I want to convert the first 64-hex back into mnemonic, so that I can restore the wallet in another app (Tonkeeper, etc.). Now my question is: how to do this?

Daniil: it's not possible (reply to 37381)

Aydin: So, any other way to restore the wallet from the hex? (reply to 37382)

Daniil: what do you mean by "restore the wallet" (reply to 37383)

Aydin: I mean, to be able to access the wallet, and to send transactions from it. E.g., to withdraw tons from it

Aydin: Could you guide me how to do the coding, please?

&rey: You can use TonWeb or @ton/ton to do so. (reply to 37385)

Howard: this method is not easy to read. (reply to 33274)

Sam: Any way I can get a response beyond just a thumbs up? My second question has gone unanswered multiple times (reply to 37379)

&rey: 1. It's possible. 2. Maximal total stake is determined by max_factor * minimal stake among all validators elected (Elector contract maximizes sum of stakes). (reply to 37379)

Sam: Thank you! Where is max_factor defined? (reply to 37390)

&rey: Usually by validator. Upper bound on it is equal to 3 (196608/65536). (reply to 37391)

Sam: How do I define max_factor for a validator I start? Does it default to 3? Or do I need to specify that in a config somewhere? (reply to 37392)

Aydin: Done! Thanks üôè  Note. Although the 2nd half of the 128-length string was used to generate the public key, for the secret key I had to use the whole length again. Using only the 1st 64-length half caused the error 'bad key size.' (reply to 37387)

Sam: I found that it defaults to 3 (reply to 37393)

Sam: Is there any way to view the mnemonic of the wallet mytoncore creates? I would prefer to just back that up if possible.  Also, is there any way to use an already created wallet instead of the one created by mytoncore?

MR: An interesting idea for TON airdrop:  A set of operations could be defined, for example:  1. The user receives 2 TON from their referral. 2. The user converts the 2 TON to jUSDT on DeDust. 3. The user converts the jUSDT back to 2 TON on StoNFI. 4. The user buys an NFT for the airdrop on GetGems for 2 TON. 5. The user sells the same NFT back on Tondimond for 2 TON. 6. The user transfers the 2 TON to their referral on the Telegram wallet.  Then, the user is given 2 TON as an airdrop, part of which also goes to the user's referral. (The operations could be more, for example, including fragmenting and so on.)  If this is done with an airdrop of 20 million TON, it would cause about 3-4 million new users to become familiar with TON ecosystem.  Because it has a referral system, as a result, that referral goes to teach the newcomers because they are also going to get a percentage.

Daniil: ‚ÄúPay fees separately‚Äù is related to forward fees for sending message. Gas fees are still covered using the value of the message (unless contract decides to cover them on its own) (reply to 37429)

Bean: One more point, do we have any stuff such as estimate gas fees to avoid tx failed?

Daniil: Some APIs have such methods, but usually you just add some constant value for fees (reply to 37431)

If the former, can that wallet be a cold wallet, or does it need to be hot?  - How are upgrades of validator-engine announced and rolled out?  - What networking rules are required on ports (inbound and outbound)? Is there a default port that validator-engine uses?  - What are the different levels of the verbosity flag for validator-engine?  - What does the --daemonize flag do on validator-engine?

User<6354011959>: I was looking at the certik report regarding the TON bridge, it said "Just as in the case of the entire blockchain, the stakes of the validators do not exceed the total supply coins of blockchains, and the stakes of the oracles do not exceed the total amount locked."  is there somewhere that i can find the stake of the oracles or the tvl of the bridge?

Howard: Can anyone confirm the validity of the following statement: For any particular (workchain,shard), contiguous seqnos always increment by one.   That is, for an example (0,2000000000000000) shard, if we're at seqno (0,2000000000000000,12345) and if a next seqno exists for that exact shard it will always be (0,2000000000000000,12346).

Mehdi: I am busy with writing a new article that makes this topics more clear .its link : https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/20 (reply to 37506)

Mehdi: Short answer is : Although conventional user wallet have deterministic way of paying gas , but as TVM is complete turing machine , the possibility is endless .you can develop any algorithm you need without any doubt.for special your usecase my suggestion is utilizing sharding as discuss in sharding article in ton blog . it means you need an infrastructure that your user has a special wallet with your specific requirement .

MonoBit: Hi everybody.  I am using blueprint to build my tact written contracts. I am trying to create a transaction via TonConnect ui-react sdk on front-end. How can I create that base64 payload to pass to the SendTransactionRequest object?  I am using the code below:  let data = new TonWeb.boc.Cell(); data.bits.writeUint(1804651575, 32); let task = new TonWeb.boc.Cell(); task.bits.writeString("My new task!"); data.refs.push(task);  // Create Payload TonWeb.utils.bytesToBase64(await data.toBoc())  But there is something wrong with my message that the contract cannot handle it.  Using ton-core was easier with the built wrappers of blueprint but I do not know how to create that boc base64 payload from the snippet below:  beginCell().store(storeMessage({$$type: "Message", "test": "HI"})).endCell()

&rey: Could you show message TL-B scheme from contract build artifacts? (reply to 37602)

Sen: Hi, I have a quesrtion: why is the master chain still being verified by validators outside of 100? such as: https://tonwhales.com/explorer/address/Ef9Ja2wbz7Dk5CzULeGhlv8RDCPOLWjXm3xOkwQBjBSta5xD

Bapi: Help me

Aydin: Perhaps the first and foremost obstacle is the fact that the whole TON ecosystem is seriously restricted in the USA.   For example, if you have followed news for the integration of Ton wallets into Telegram, you may have noticed that it is not accessible from the United States.  Even the historic event that finally led to the abandonment of the TON Project by Telegram and its subsequent renaissance as what is at present, was the problem of Telegram with some US restrictions. (reply to 37673)

Edward: It was interesting to search and read a little on Reddit /r/ Crypto about TON. I assume the audience of Reddit Crypto is massively USA based. I was shocked to read that very few people had heard about the project. Once Telegram was mentioned on a thread about TON, everyone then immediately dismissed it as 'Telegram is full of scammers' ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (reply to 37681)

Sen: Hi, may I ask why pools always appear in pairs?

Jon Ren | Titan: Hey guys love to ask Does telegram allow us to embled web browser inside?

Behrang: After a round of validation (18 hours), the staked amount is blocked (for 9 hours) to punish misbehaving validators. While waiting, the next round is in progress.  If validators don't create the second pool, their servers will do nothing while waiting. So the second pool helps them to use the server all the time. (reply to 37694)

Sen: Thanks! In order to create two pools, does it require twice the funds? (reply to 37697)

Sen: If so, the actual cost of the server should be a very small part. The additional need for 400k TON is the decisive factor, right?

Daniil: Right. But you can try using nominator pools to collect the required amount if you don't have that much Toncoin. (reply to 37699)

Sen: Thank you! Is there any guide about how to create nominator pools? (reply to 37700)

Sen: Is this one https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool that used?

Behrang: This is the smart contract. However, to start a nominator pool, read more here:  https://tonvalidators.org/ (reply to 37702)

Sen: Yeah, I have checked that website, but I can't find any guides about how to create/register new nominator pool to collect stake. (reply to 37703)

Sam: hey guys

Behrang: Looks like the documentation has changed. (reply to 37704)

Sam: is there a way to read blocks in TONWEB >? like we do in evm?

Behrang: Read this blog for nominator pool setup:  https://blog.ton.cat/how-to-validate-the-blockchain/  This may also help: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/blob/master/docs/en/nominator-pool.md (reply to 37703)

Sam: https://dpaste.org/pyhrb  this is my EVM implementation for it, i am looking to do something similar for TON (reply to 37707)

Sam: is there a way to do that? @behrang ?

Behrang: I don't undestand your question. You want to read the blocks to what end? (reply to 37710)

Sam: like all the transactions of a contract, then do something with the transaction logs ( Events )

Sam: on server @behrang

Sam: seems like its doable in python  https://github.com/yungwine/TonTools  is there a similar js library for it?  ```client = TonCenterClient(orbs_access=True,                          testnet=True)  contract = Contract('EQBvW8Z5huBkMJYdnfAEM5JqTNkuWX3diqYENkWsIL0XggGG', client) print((await contract.get_transactions(limit=10))[-1].out_msgs[0].destination)  # kQCdaMggjCXoW867yRXilPw2bu8Av9dSBlGGCdDPIGNLKM8N```

Behrang: TonWeb is usually used on client side. You may want to look at tonapi.io or toncenter.com for webservices to read blocks. There are also some tools in different languages, like tonutils-go for golang.

Sam: leme check that, thanks fren <3

Sam: /v2/blockchain/accounts/{account_id} /methods/{method_name}  would this api work in case i use contract address as account_id  and in method name i would put the method name whos events i am interested in? @behrang

Behrang: I personally haven't got the chance to use those APIs, other devs here may help you. (reply to 37717)

Denis: i works even you use it as domain name (reply to 37717)

Sam: xD i didnt get the domain name reference (reply to 37719)

Sam: ( i am new to TON )

Denis: https://tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/accounts/subbotin.ton/methods/seqno

Sam: gawd daymn this api seems really nice

Denis: any over forms of account address will work too

Sam: so like i can pool event logs for a contract with this api easily

Sam: seems nice, i was under the impression TON is very hard xD but this api is really handy :"D

Sam: @subden just one question, the transactions this api will give me, would all be success transactions? right?

Sam: in multiversX case i was getting failed and pending TX as well then i had to put a seperate Queue to look out for new status of pending transactions

Denis: in ton trasaction doesn't have really one "Success" attribute

Himu Globin: Hey, guys. we are keen to launch our product on TON. Product is solid and market validated for actual revenue generation. How can we go forward with applying for developer grant/support?  thanks

dean: How can i convert 24-word mnemonic to receiving address? I am using the console in wallet.ton.org

Behrang: I don't know, but maybe using mytonctrl on a testnet node, may help. (reply to 37752)

Behrang: I think so, since mytonctrl automates the sending of messages that are needed for validation.  Yes, since the wallet needs to send messages, it needs some TON for gas. (reply to 37753)

Sam: Where did you find the 50k minimum of you don‚Äôt have an explorer? (reply to 37758)

Sam: Where can I find how much gas is needed for validation? (reply to 37759)

Behrang: To bring up a node on testnet, you don't need any wallet at all. But to participate in validation rounds on the testnet, you'll need that 50k. So if you just want to test for yourself, you can easily bring a node up.  I developed a smart contract for participating in validations (Hipo), then asked @f_closer for test TON, to test the process in testnet before launching on mainnet. (reply to 37760)

Behrang: That gas amount is minimal compared to the staked amount. For example in the mainnet and nominator pools, apart from the 300k, you'll need around 200 TON per month. As the validator earns TON in the process of validating, nobody cares about that 200 TON. (reply to 37761)

Sam: atleast there are no pending transactions through the api, right? (reply to 37729)

Denis: It depends (reply to 37765)

Sam: so there can be pending transactions? (reply to 37766)

Sam: that would mean if i query transactions and if there are pending ones, ill miss those through the api? as i have already read the first 5, then when i read next 5, the pending one will become success at index 2, making me re read 5th tx on 2nd round, and miss the pending tx which was at index 2?

Denis: Do you have experience in other cryptocurrencies?

Sam: yeah, evm and multiversX, evm doesnt give pending transactions when u read through transactions, multiversX did, so i had to fire an other service which kept track of new status on pending tx

Denis: Forget all what you learned in a school other blockchains  :) (reply to 37770)

Sam: :"D

Sam: enlighten me o wise one, how would i go about pooling tx hashes to read events in TON of a specific contract

Denis: Firstly you are sending to blockchain not transactions but messages. And they create transactions.

Denis: So you can't predict hash of the transaction

Sam: well my usecase doesn't require me to predict, i wanna read the tx which went successful, and then check their logs to make decisions in my server

User<95392270>: https://t.me/tondev_eng/37776

Denis: Liteserver and toncenter return only transactions which encluded to blocks. Tonapi.io also returns emulated transactions in some cases. Something like pending. But in these cases we add in_progress: true (reply to 37776)

Sam: so basically i want to look at liteserver or toncenter apis, as their transactions would always be the successfulones, no failure and no pendings (reply to 37778)

Denis: No pendings - yes. No failure - no

Denis: In TON, each transaction has a million attributes and options for executing various phases, and an attempt to derive from this a single sign of the success of a transaction turns out very poorly. Blockchain is for the smart ones.  In the ethereum a transaction simply has a binary sign of success/unsuccess (well, pending until it is included in the block ).Blockchain for stupids.  And in Bitcoin, all transactions are either successful or not in the blockchain. Blockchain for successful ones.

Denis: Sorry for google translate

Sam: its fine, thanks for the information <3

Sam: this helped alot <3

Sam: so i am looking at this /getTransactions api in https://toncenter.com/ it has a attribute " IT" ( Logical time of transaction to start with, must be sent with hash. ) what does it mean? do i have to specify how long it took for a transaction?

Denis: Wiki: logical time

dean: How can i convert 24-word mnemonic to receiving address? I am using the console in wallet.ton.org

Sam: is logical time unique for all transactions? (reply to 37786)

Sam: I mean $500 per month is a pretty substantial amount still, regardless of how much the validator earns. Thank you though! (reply to 37763)

Sam: Do you know where rewards for the validator self stake from a nominator pool go? Do they stay staked in the pool? Or are they sent to the validator wallet? Just trying to figure out if I need to manage manual withdrawals from the pool to cover those fees  Or are those transaction fees taken from the validators stake in the pool, as opposed to the validator wallet itself?

Â∞èÈ©¨: Do validators randomly select validators when packaging blocks?

Philip: Hi I am running a full node with lite server, download the snapshot from dump site, every time the node start to download the archive, it crashed, with the latest msg, downloaded archive slice: /data/ton/tmp/tmpXXXXNalgKc

Philip: anything I can do for the debug?

&rey: Yes. You may find the details in https://docs.ton.org/catchain.pdf. (reply to 37884)

ETON: Can TonKeeper wallet import two wallet addresses, are there other TON wallets that can import multiple addresses?

Behrang: This is about nominator pools:  (and I might forgot something but this should give you an idea of how it works)  There is a wallet for the validator. Let's call it ValW.  ValW creates one or two nominator pools, let's call them Pool1, Pool2.  To activate them ValW should send 10,000 TON to pools.  To operate these pools, ValW should have around 200 TON per month to send messages to the network.  When pools are operational, they generate rewards and the accounts in the pool will receive the rewards. Specifically the account holding the validators stake (that 10,000) will receive the reward for the validator. So yes, you may need to withdraw those rewards from time to time. (reply to 37883)

Sam: guys is there a example on how to decode logs from a ton transaction?

Sam: also is writing contract in tact safe?

Sam: or one should rather write in func

Dima: Hey, guys, is TACT production ready? If so, wich version is the most stable and bug free?

Howard: is it possible set the TON dollar value in validator side or in the Config setting side?

–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π: if you mean the ability to set the validator stake size in dollars, then program mytonctrl does not have this Perhaps other validator control programs can do this, but I don‚Äôt know of any (reply to 37896)

Mehdi: Hi , does smart contract without depends on external world , by itself could initiate transaction? Something like cronjob in Linux world.

Sam: nope

Sam: blockchain is like static, until a external entity touches it, it cant do anything (reply to 37898)

Mehdi: I guess so. Is it true for block zero as well ?I meant for first time that Blockchain are about to start? Since every thing is smart contract I am curious. (reply to 37900)

Sam: ye its true for the bootstrap block as well (reply to 37901)

Sam: and smart contract exists on blockchain, blockchain is not a smart contract

Sam: e.g : bitcoin does not support smart contracts, its still a blockchain

Mehdi: Sorry , Blockchain here refers to TON .Thank you for clearness

Dario: thats not true (reply to 37904)

Dario: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script

Sam: are you implying bitcoin can support traditional type of smart contracts? (reply to 37906)

Dario: depends what you mean by "traditional". there is no standard for such things, tvm and evm themselves are pretty different

Dario: but you can implement simple logic using btc scripts  there are also compilers/toolkits for it  https://min.sc/

Sam: ig i didnt know about this, seems quite cool, thanks for letting me know

Mehdi: Another question , with already tools and specifications in hand , is it possible we develop a whole Blockchain like TON   with one  smart contract as entrypoint? What does it mean ? A unique world or group of smart contract yet benefit from infrastructure TON provided , and also reside on base chain (not new workchian) such that craft everything for themselves,like new TLB schema , protocol and so on .but preserve available and necessary protocol and standard for work with whole system I mean compatibility issues. Why was this question asked? As the TVM is a complete Turing machine it means we can accomplish any algorithms. so why not a unique tiny TON Blockchain for proof of concept. Ultimately think of this process as a Nano service like Microservices in web2. It seems ridiculous, but its purpose is learning by using abstraction.This question does not expect details but an overview like  answer

Mehdi: How can we suggest a new term for the community, where is place for discussion. For example if somebody want to develop a book like " TON Blockchain, Nano Service Design Pattern" and bring this concept in whole community as a how we should think "Tonic"( this is another new word),and approach coding just for newcomers .Or suggest a new term like  "Naton"  that comprised from Nano and TON it has obvious meaning,and meant to replace for nanoton.(this reduce one syllabus for billion times everywhere and have clear concise meaning )

Andrew: Introducing TonSdk.Adnl: Native ADNL Implementation in C# (over TCP) for TON  üîç We are excited to announce the launch of TonSdk.Adnl - our implementation of the ADNL protocol in C# using TCP. This development greatly simplifies the integration of ADNL into various applications within the TON ecosystem, enhancing both security and reliability of communications.  üí° TonSdk.Adnl includes features for generating ADNL addresses, as well as sending and receiving messages with encryption and digital signing. This makes data exchange between nodes more secure and efficient.  üë• With TonSdk.Adnl, developers can easily implement secure and reliable communication solutions in their projects, expanding the capabilities of the TON network. We believe this innovation will positively impact the development and expansion of the TON ecosystem.  üîó Links: [github] [nuget] (forwarded from Continuation Team)

Dima: Is there an example of encoding and decoding cells with Tonweb?

sb: Yes, there are lots of repositories on GitHub with examples. First of all, try loadMessage method in ton-core library. If you want to encode cellsl, you should use the Cell class and internal class method toBoc (reply to 37915)

sb: Cell.fromBoc(<Buffer from BoC>);  new Cell().asBuilder().storeAddress(...).asCell().toBoc();

Dima: Thanks, trying that.

Â∞èÈ©¨: Thank you, sir (reply to 37888)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Every block in TON is packaged by validators. Do nominators have the right to package it?

Â∞èÈ©¨: Who generated the hash value in the picture? (reply to 37921)

&rey: No. Nominators are most often offline during most of validation round. (reply to 37921)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Is this a random selection of validators? (reply to 37923)

&rey: Nominators are also called stakers. I think most of them open Tonkeeper, stake their funds and go away, periodically checking their balance, and that's all. (reply to 37924)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Are the hashes in the graph randomly cryptographically generated by the validator?

&rey: Validators are full node runners.

Â∞èÈ©¨: Are the 366 verification nodes randomly selected to package blocks? (reply to 37927)

&rey: The question misrepresents the issue. Validator ID is stated above, in "Created by". Transaction hash which is in frame is deterministic hash of transaction cell. (reply to 37926)

&rey: (Transaction hash doesn't depend on validator.)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Which of these two belongs to the block hash value?

Â∞èÈ©¨: So can anyone modify the parameters of this transaction hash value? (reply to 37930)

&rey: Pair of them is commonly used to identify block. (Though, indexers can find block from just one hash, of course) (reply to 37931)

&rey: Rather, no one can, even validators. (reply to 37932)

Â∞èÈ©¨: I tried to find the block by the block hash in the graph but failed

&rey: ? https://dton.io/graphql/#query=%7B%0A%20%20blocks(root_hash%3A%20%2222a24cd0b3f2254e23e094e0c6ee0eddf82ad1408c156624bd9e97b96acb93e9%22)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20gen_utime%0A%20%20%20%20seqno%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D (reply to 37935)

Â∞èÈ©¨: The transaction hash value uses base64 and it should be possible to modify the transaction hash value.

&rey: Does something make you believe so? (reply to 37937)

Â∞èÈ©¨: I just want to figure out this hash security

&rey: SHA256 ‚Äî no collisions for it have been found yet. (reply to 37939)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Is Root hash generated through File hash? (reply to 37940)

&rey: You should consult whitepaper for that. (reply to 37941)

Gio: Hey guys the managers of the community chat redirected me here

olanre: Hello

Gio: Im looking for a developer or an expert to dedicate a few minutes in DM and answer some questions

Gio: Im pretty excited about this project

Alex: Same question here (reply to 36985)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Is there a 3-second interval between each block generation? (reply to 37942)

Â∞èÈ©¨: First, the data to be calculated is converted into binary format. 2. Then, use a hash algorithm (such as SHA-256) to calculate the binary data. Hashing algorithms convert data into fixed-length hash values. 3. Finally, convert the calculated hash value into hexadecimal format as the final result. Tron's hash value calculation method is similar to other cryptocurrencies, mainly using the SHA-256 algorithm. SHA-256 is a hash algorithm widely used in the cryptocurrency field and is highly secure and irreversible. By calculating hash values, transactions and blockchain verification can be achieved to ensure data integrity and security. At the same time, the calculation of hash values can also be used to generate wallet addresses to protect users‚Äô asset security. In short, the method of calculating the hash value is to convert the data to be calculated into binary format, then use a hash algorithm to calculate the binary data, and finally convert the calculated hash value into hexadecimal format. The calculation of hash values plays an important role in transaction verification, blockchain verification and wallet address generation. (reply to 37942)

&rey: Most questions are already answered in the chat! Do you have a specific project in mind? (TON chats' moderators don't usually DM you, by the way) (reply to 37945)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Transaction hash value can be modified (reply to 37949)

Gio: I do, but I don‚Äôt want it to be disclosed publicly as of now (reply to 37950)

&rey: 1. I don't see such conclusion in the text you sent. 2. Have you asked ChatGPT? (reply to 37951)

Gio: It‚Äôs obviously based on the open network

Â∞èÈ©¨: Thank you for your patient answer. I am willing to transfer you TON as a reward. (reply to 37950)

Gio: Is it possible to offer rewards here to get questions answered?

&rey: Usually that's not needed. (reply to 37956)

Gio: I have a series of questions that may require a person that is expert or Atleast above average knowledge

Gio: And may require up to 10 minutes to answer

Gio: I respect people‚Äôs time

&rey: There is a good mechanism of checks, either by @wallet or @CryptoBot! (reply to 37955)

Â∞èÈ©¨: OK, thanks

&rey: Unfortunately I don't have much time now. (reply to 37959)

Gio: To anyone that has 10 minutes to time to dedicate in dm i offer a reward of 100$ in TON

Daniil: And why do you assume that this group is ‚Äúall scam‚Äù? (reply to 37979)

Daniel: It was slk task group

Daniel: Cuz dat platform just scammed me of my money so dat means this platform is also a scam (reply to 37980)

Daniil: TON? (reply to 37982)

Daniel: I meant the SLK TASK GROUP dat invited me to this platform (reply to 37983)

Daniil: We have nothing to do with that group you‚Äôre talking about. How is TON related to that (and especially ton developers chat)? (reply to 37984)

Daniel: Cuz the Admin of that group sent the link

Daniil: Anybody can send the link. (reply to 37986)

Daniel: So if I was sc scammed there that means this platform is a also fake

Daniel: That's the head Admin (reply to 37987)

Daniil: Who? (reply to 37989)

Daniel: Michelle

Daniil: Is that an admin of any TON official groups? (reply to 37991)

Daniel: Dats you guys business

Daniel: U guys know wat u are doing

Daniil: Why do you assume this group and TON in general to be ‚Äúscam‚Äù if you were scammed by someone not related to TON in any way? (reply to 37993)

Daniel: Cuz the group was designed this way no difference (reply to 37995)

Daniel: And the head admin introduced yur platform also

researcher: If someone from a scam group sends you a link to Google Support, it doesn't imply that Google itself is a scam. üôÇ Similarly, this is the official TON Dev Chat, aimed at assisting developers. (reply to 37996)

Daniel: So dat means u guys have hidden age nda

Daniel: I know wet am saying (reply to 37998)

Daniil: If you continue to do such assumptions I‚Äôll have to mute you and delete the messages.  You were scammed by someone outside of this (and any other) official groups and we have nothing to do with that.

Mehdi: Also remember this golden sentences, " IN CODE WE TRUST". (reply to 37997)

Daniel: Mmm You guys are really good sweet talkers (reply to 38002)

Daniel: All the same

Daniel: Birds of the same feathers

Mehdi: You should know one purpose of Blockchain is put trust away by means of technology that come with code. Your talk is completely irelavant.sorry (reply to 38005)

Daniel: Well  Enjoy (reply to 38006)

Sam: So validator rewards will go to the pool, but tx fees are paid from the ValW outside of the pool?  And where do you see this 10,000 self-stake requirement? All the docs I have seen say 1000 (reply to 37891)

Â∞èÈ©¨: Is the TON block a Merkle tree structure?

Maksim: it‚Äôs not (reply to 38009)

Maksim: some block parts can be replaced with Merkle Proof or Update exotic Cells, you can read about them in docs

Â∞èÈ©¨: How could it have a Root hash if it wasn't? (reply to 38010)

Maksim: because any structure in TON is a Cell tree (reply to 38012)

Â∞èÈ©¨: So it is the Merkle tree (reply to 38013)

Maksim: no :) read something about cells in docs (reply to 38014)

Â∞èÈ©¨: OK (reply to 38015)

Behrang: 1- Yes  2- I'm not sure, maybe I'm wrong about the amount, but the flow is like that I said. (reply to 38008)

Daniil: Well, any cell tree can be efficiently used for merkle proofs (reply to 38015)

Sam: One more question - is the 200 TON per month requirement for a single pool? So I would actually need 400 per month? Or is that 200 TON enough to manage the continuous elections of both pools? (reply to 38017)

Behrang: I don't know for sure. (reply to 38028)

Emre: how can I learn user jetton balance? What can I do ?    const jettonWalletAddress = Address.parse(jettonAddress);      const jettonMaster = client.open(JettonMaster.create(jettonWalletAddress));     const jettonContractUserAddress = (       await jettonMaster.getWalletAddress(Address.parse(userFriendlyAddress))     ).toString();

Mehdi: External inbound message can not bear value. So how first contract get its balance ?I mean there is no smart contract to send it any value because this is first contract  and we can not send value from outside world.

Mehdi: I guess it should related to masterchain, as we know rules and config also is smart contract . so we should have special contract from zero block .

Zenith Studio LLC: Can we launch the game using  TON  sdk but still have the main token on ETH ?

Zenith Studio LLC: is it possible ?

Zenith Studio LLC: i am talking about this...if anyone has idea please clear my doubts

Mehdi: Would you please tell me why you want to do this cooperation? General speaking  this is possible because we are powerful tools in hand named code. we can do anything we imagine. But maybe there is no ready smooth route yet. And this is also no problem, as engineer we find a way or we build a way. Ton has much more capabilities than Ethereum. I guess very soon all ecosystem around it consider migration here .so my advice is to stay  away from Ethereum and utilities TON  because the future is here .This is my point of view.

Behrang: I haven't used the metadata uri approach. So your way differs from mine.  Isn't it a caching problem? Maybe you have used an older uri previously and now changed it, but tonviewer cached it?  I had a similar issue with Tonkeeper, and images where cached. I managed to change the URL a little (by adding a ?v=1 at the end) to bypass the cache.

tina: Is it possible to configure redirection upon successful connection or transactions within the TON wallet on Telegram? Why does setting the returnStrategy address for wallet connections enable the return to the respective address, whereas configuring the address within sendTransaction does not take effect?

&rey: It can be changed on the basechain, as well as on masterchain or other workchains if they are created. See "config parameters" in docs. (reply to 38296)

&rey: You don't need to replace tx with signedtx: tx is already signed for that matter, and even if it wasn't you were signing message incorrectly. (reply to 38294)

Ceren: Hi frens, when one of our community members tried to vote in The Open League voting page they got the error as shown on the image. It is because it does not have the voting power at the height of the block where the voting is opened, so it can participate in the next one but not in the previous one.

Lawree: Okay

&rey: "sign transaction" is meaningless in TON. (reply to 38313)

&rey: You can create an external message and send it; this message is delivered to a contract, usually wallet contract, which parses it; signatures are checked on that level.

Sumit: And how do we get transaction hash of a transaction

Sumit: So you mean you sign a message when you create it there is no way to create a message then sign it separately? (reply to 38319)

Sumit: I just went through the SDK I saw there was a sign function too which takes Cells and produces an buffer

Sumit: Hopefully signed transaction

Sumit: And when I tried to send that it gave me invalid bag of cells

Zheng: As far as I know, TON Space works like any wallets that impl. the TON Connect, I am not sure is it right?

Daniil: ton space supports ton connect, right (reply to 38329)

Zheng: Thanks. With Ton connect,  before any write message send to the chain may launch the wallet app to sign and send, which blocked some of our users from web2. So I am looking for any non-custodial MPC wallet solution that could help users sign in the app. ÔºàAbsolutely with lower security, but will be more acceptable for web2 users)

Colin: Hey guys! I'm working on a data visualization platform, and I'd like to get some data into my database to visualize about TON. It doesn't have to be all the data ever, but being able to do some overall analytical queries like count of blocks/transactions per month... maybe a viz of burn rate... things like that. I have looked over some apis and things, but don't see an easy way to bring in this type of data. Any tips? Thanks in advance

User<5842008916>: Hi, anyone knows something about that?: i sent a ton nft (anonymous number) to a standard eth wallet. With standard wallet i manage native metis coins, and also i can see the nft on ton explorer that is property of my eth standard wallet. The issue i when i want to connect to ton web3 services, it cant conect. So i tried to open with seedphrase at tonkeeper my wallet... and they arent compatible, seems its another algorism... so now i have an nft what i cant use, and i cant move to a ton wallet... but it is already on ton explorer... if someone knows how to solve my problem, or anyone knows if in the future standard wallets can conect to fragment (for example)? Or i just lost the nft. If any dev with blockchain knowledge can help me understand this o will be very grateful. Thanks for your time

Andrew: Introducing openlib.func: open-source extended library for FunC!  üõ† Currently, we're using this library for smart-contracts development in the Continuation Finance. It not only optimizes gas consumption in common scenarios but also simplifies the development of our contracts.  üîß Our library comprises three modules:  openlib.func: The core part of the library giving many builders for standard situations, as well as interesting functions that make contract development more efficient.  gaslib.func: This module implements gas params keeping and gas-to-gram calculation in the smart-contract. Recognizing the importance of considering the amount of gas used is crucial within the security context of smart-contract development.  mathlib.func: Currently, this module includes a highly optimized square root function. However, be aware that we plan to complement it with new functions in the future.  üîó Links: [github] (forwarded from Continuation Team)

Colin: Ok I'll have a look thx a lot (reply to 38371)

Maxwell: yeah, but there's no guarantee projects would use the exact same code from official impls, as jetton_wallet_code is critical for calculate the jetton_wallet_address for some cases. (reply to 38360)

Maxwell: > docker run --rm -it -v ./jetton_tests:/code toncli-local run_tests -c jetton_minter  Try to run the jetton_tests under token-contract repo, but it seems the cmd line not working?  the volume binding for jetton_tests as root but it also needs to read the  ../ft/* files. How to resolve this?

Maxwell: There're custom jetton token which my contract is the owner, and I need to send jetton to other wallet, so I need to calculate the jetton_wallet_address on the fly, but the jetton's implementation is agnostic for my contract. (reply to 38374)

Maxwell: My previous (wrong) assumption is there's standrard & unified implementation for jettons, but it turns about to be wrong as @pcrafter suggested, so I need to change the architecture design to handle the uncertainty.

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: You don‚Äôt need recipient Jetton address to send jettons to him. Read TEP 74 - you need address of new owner (his main wallet), not his Jetton (reply to 38376)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: https://t.me/tondev_eng/34329 or check this quick summary

Maxwell: Sorry, I might not be clear enought, I mean calculate the jetton_wallet_address owned by my_contract, not the receivers. (reply to 38376)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: On chain (in contract) or off-chain (backend/server/‚Ä¶)? (reply to 38380)

Maxwell: Onchain

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Do you need one project-specific Jetton or all jettons you own?

Maxwell: I could deploy my contract with jetton_wallt_address be null, then send jetton X to my contract, which would generate a new address and set the address to contract or generate the contract on the fly with jetton_master_address and jetton_wallet_code.  The jetton with each instance of my contract could be different.

Maxwell: wallet contract doesn't handle bounced messages, so If Toncoin transfers out to some contract, the refund would only be possible if the receiver contract has the logic for sending it back when error happens, right?  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/main/func/wallet-v4-code.fc#L12

Howard: Hello Community, I am exploring and researching mechanisms for projects on other chains to transition to TON, and here is a very challenging question: How can we manage high computational needs on-chain?  I believe this is a critical question and presents a good opportunity for us to try onboarding projects from non-EVM chains to TON.  Essentially, they need to update multiple fields dynamically. However, since I am not an expert in Rust or the MOVE language, I am here to share and find out who can provide insights on how these logics can be implemented in FunC & Tact, among others.  Here is the Medium post that discusses the challenges they faced on Sui: [Medium Article Link].  *Essentially, there also has a work in progress to implement this at the Sui virtual machine level.   It may be beneficial to reference this to understand why they need it, and to discern the differences between the SVM and TVM, I believe.

Rio: I totally understand your interest in using the ToonTools library to generate a mnemonic that can be used in Trust Wallet and vice versa. However, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding. To my knowledge, there is no specific "ToonTools" library related to generating mnemonics for Trust Wallet or any other wallet.  In general, to generate a mnemonic that can be used in Trust Wallet or other wallets, you can follow these steps:  1. Use a reputable library or tool, such as the BIP39 library, to generate a mnemonic phrase. BIP39 is a widely used standard for generating mnemonics.  2. Make sure to keep your mnemonic phrase secure and private. It's crucial to write it down on paper and store it in a safe place. Do not share it with anyone or store it digitally, as it can increase the risk of it being compromised.  3. When setting up or restoring your Trust Wallet or any other wallet, you will usually have an option to enter or import your mnemonic phrase. Follow the wallet's instructions to complete the process.  Remember, it's essential to be cautious with your mnemonic phrase as it acts as a key to your funds. If you have any specific questions about Trust Wallet or if you need further assistance, feel free to ask! (reply to 38477)

mohsen: Thank you very much for your attention I think there is a misunderstanding that I need to explain further I want to generate mnemonics using Python and then use that to create my wallet address and then create transactions.  The official documentation of the TON site recommends the "TonTools" library for interacting with the blockchain.  Now, using this library, I have started generating new mnemonics.

Mehdi: In most cases, the sender will attach a small amount of Toncoin (e.g., one Toncoin) to the internal message (sufficient to pay for the processing of this message) and set its "bounce" flag (i.e., send a bounceable internal message); the receiver will return the unused portion of the received value with the answer (deducting message forwarding fees from it). This is normally accomplished by invoking SENDRAWMSG with mode = 64 (cf. Appendix A of the TON VM documentation) .from here It seems we have two scenarios, when an error occurs and when we use it as a feature. Now can I concluded , bounce and bounced is not just due to error?

Mehdi: Note that if, after accept_message, some error is thrown (either in ComputePhase or ActionPhase), the transaction will be written to the blockchain, and fees will be deducted from the contract balance. However, storage will not be updated, and actions will not be applied, as is the case in any transaction with an error exit code.  As a result, if the contract accepts an external message and then throws an exception due to an error in the message data or the sending of an incorrectly serialized message, it will pay for processing but will have no way of preventing message replay. The same message will be accepted by the contract over and over until it consumes the entire balance. This also comes from here

Mehdi: messages will be bounced if sent in bounceable mode and contain enough money to pay for their processing and the creation of bounce messages also comes from previous link

Maxwell: Contract A send msg(with msg_body bits length 678) to Contract B, and it bounced back, the bounced msg has bits length 288. Does the bounced msg body get truncated?

Andrey: All these cell structures and so on are just a handy data structure so you can do simple Merkle stuff  As far as TVM is involved, the idea is a bit different. TVM is made under the TON actor system, which leads to potential infinite sharding. TVM developers develop smart contracts with the actor system in mind, which in theory allows their contracts to work for a very large number of people with low execution fees. (reply to 38686)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Standard Method for Defining Opcodes in func from Jeff  Hello,  I've been exploring different repositories and noticed inconsistencies in how opcodes are defined. For example, in the ft and nft implementation within the token-contract repository, opcodes are defined as follows:  int op::transfer() asm "0x5fcc3d14 PUSHINT";   However, in the liquid-staking-contract repository, the definition is quite different:  const int op::nft_transfer = 0x5fcc3d14;   While I understand that these are essentially the same, I'm curious about the more commonly accepted or standard method for defining opcodes in func  Additionally, I've observed that the ft and nft implementation in the token-contract repository might be outdated. It uses builder_null from stdlib.fc in this repo, but the stdlib.fc in the official documentation doesn‚Äôt include it.  Could someone clarify these points for me?  üîó Answer on TON Overflow

User<956848646>: Fragment auctions should be cancelled immediately!

Anthony: TON20 Inscription Use-case on TON Starting on December 5th, The Open Network (TON) experienced an incredible spike in network activity, thanks to the BRC20 Bitcoin Ordinals type of inscription use-case, called TON20, launched by the Tonano team.   Producing over 2 million transactions increased our network usage by 61 times within just half an hour. TON Community is proud to witness a creative use case take-off in TON driven by independent participants in the ecosystem.  Moreover, this sudden growth has revealed many interesting insights for our blockchain. Dynamic sharding technology worked as expected. At its peak, TON split into eleven shardchains, stabilizing at five shardchains to handle the heavy load.  At the same time, this phenomenon also revealed where the community should work to swiftly onboard the exponential increase in network activity expected in the near future. Network validators must ensure that TON is supported by hardware capable of scaling to the performance demanded by high usage.  Network Performance Delays This peak interest also came with a severe congestion of TON network, where validation was severely delayed even though the network validators are still producing blocks.   Popular wallets like @Wallet and Tonkeeper have paused the service temporarily.  TON core developers are aware of the issues affecting users and are working on TON blockchain. An initial technical report is available here. TON core team will be providing us with a further update within the next 24 hours.   We thank you and the community for your patience and unwavering support as we go through the growing pains together, preparing for the unprecedented growth season expected in the near future.

Here is the link to it in the browser https://tonviewer.com/EQBoYF5rlWZ9XHpi1O4vGU0bCteZFqoYliZD64vjlRzaZ1/transaction/53ad9db6715f44d1637f7a6be079157fe30d4b5964b03bb7217e9f715a9724c3 .The screenshot shows what the reviewer writes about this translation. What to do in such a situation?!(https://i.ibb.co/brDxn1j/IMG-20231208-113931.jpg)  üîó Answer on TON Overflow

Ë£∏Ë£∏: hello I meet a problem.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: the two transaction one is 1 input 1 outputÔºå while another one is 1 input, 0 output„ÄÇ

Ë£∏Ë£∏: so why?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/transactions/dd979231ce0dc18d6fd019daae4d91fce87f05ca06d4e54bcfeb552997b5bf07 https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/transactions/1a0abf5db9bf52bdce4e6c1a632d721eecb7711918f4297ae68db4818bc5f410

Ë£∏Ë£∏: this is the transaction request get response json.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: In my project, I want to know what the TransOrd do.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: to see who transfer to whom how many ton.

saul: https://tonviewer.com/blackout (reply to 39008)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: for one json I can parse it like this:

Ë£∏Ë£∏: {          "chain": "TON_TESTNET",          "txid": "1a0abf5db9bf52bdce4e6c1a632d721eecb7711918f4297ae68db4818bc5f410",          "transferTimestamp": 1702028203000,          "blockNum": 16397192,          "confirmations": -1307875,          "result": true,          "remark": "SUCCESS",          "feeSymbol": "TON",          "feeAmountCoin": "0.000333343",          "feeSymbolPrice": "2.294675485035269",          "feeAmountUsdt": "0.000764914010208111674267",          "transfers": [           {            "transferType": "TRANSFER",            "fromAddress": "0:507dea7d606f22d9e85678d3eede39bbe133a868d2a0e3e07f5502cb70b8a512",            "toAddress": "0:deaae6518a11fd24c1da9c53ad38aedd35f4a66d1bef4f1e3081472d9276a920",            "operatorAddress": "",            "symbol": "TON",            "contract": "TON",            "amount": "0.00023",            "amountInUsdt": "0.00052777536155811187",            "logIdx": 0           }          ]         }

Ë£∏Ë£∏: but for another get this:

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I use this code: t.cvtTransfers(transaction.GetInMsg(), transaction.GetOutMsgs(), price2USD)

User<956848646>: Because the transfer address is still negative. Change the OA. (reply to 39020)

User<956848646>: Which is the reason for TransOrd.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: my procedure can not get the right result because no outmsgs.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: still negative is what?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: how to change the OA?

zeroxx: Ë∑®ÈìæÂç°‰Ωè‰∫ÜÊÄé‰πàÂºÑÂìá

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I am a simple developer with ton. I always make mistake.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: can you explain to me more details.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I even don't know what is OA.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: the two transactions are both success.

User<956848646>: We call that operator address :D. (reply to 39033)

User<956848646>: I know. But it leads to a 0 output. (reply to 39034)

User<956848646>: I‚Äôll send you the details over. We came across the same issue.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: the no output transaction is caused by the ton bot. faucet.

User<956848646>: Check your inbox.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: any other dev can help me?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: my boss want me to get the "who transfer whom how may ton".

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I can get the result even no out_msgs.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: but I don't know the deep reason.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: If I don't understand the deep reason, my procedure may have a hole, a bug.

&rey: Destination contract, when receiving message, may send 0-255 messages itself. (reply to 39013)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: means 0-255 is all ok.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I can change my procedure.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Hope there are no bugs„ÄÇ

Ë£∏Ë£∏: when the msg have out_msgs the in_msg have no source field.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: when the msg don't have out_msgs the in_msg have source.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: So interesting, so strange, so incomprehensible, hahaha, my off work time is up, I will continue tomorrow.

Daniil: in_msg may be external-in which comes from any party in the internet without any direct linking to some address in blockchain. (reply to 39055)

Daniil: this is exactly how wallets work in TON: they are triggered by external-in messages that are coming from your wallet app.

&rey: Make sure to check out transaction chains on tonviewer.com: it shows graphs which may prove useful. (reply to 39057)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: ok nice thank you.

Fly: Hi guys, can anyone explain why the TON network was down and how it was being fixed, does it mean it might be down again if 1 of the validators is failed?

Anthony: Check out our post: https://t.me/toncoin/1084 (reply to 39062)

Fly: that is the message confused me, if one of the shardchains is down, will that shut down the TON network as a whole? (reply to 39063)

Fly: and is a shardchain run by a single node or this is also a distributed network.

Fly: sorry I am kinda new to TON

Nha: Honestly I think if they just admit that the guy who responsible for this is on vacation, the whole story would be more believable ^_^

Speculator: i am trying to mint jetton tokens tx is getting executed but it is getting failed with exit code 65535   url: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQAKVhXV0DeeqbJbFS2tV2LJafmC4EnGDl857xO4xNXjhref/transaction/5b8a0b03713b11f4123d53ee33c8bee39d4abf3bc4db84f6d95744ab76775345

Speculator: can someone help me dubug this

Light: lol (reply to 39067)

&rey: Messages directed to that shardchain are stored in outgoing message queues of other shards, and that creates problems. (reply to 39064)

&rey: Excess TONs are returned to wrong address; please check whether you're filling response_address and similar correctly. (reply to 39068)

Fly: so each validator is single point of failure of a shard, and each shard is a single point of failure of the whole network? (reply to 39072)

Fly: Sorry I might hv asked a dumb question, because I don't really understand

&rey: TON is not really down, but transaction chains may take hours to complete because new messages are put into queue at its end. (reply to 39074)

Fly: so it wont down, but the throughput depends on the weakest validator? (reply to 39076)

Fly: and what is the fix for that, cos I heard that is already been fixed

Fly: I was being asked by someone with this question, and I dont know how to answer cos I dont have strong tech background

&rey: IIRC, approximately that. That's why core team has asked people to disable validators with less than 16 vCPUs. (reply to 39077)

Fly: got it (reply to 39080)

&rey: And it's impossible to simply kick validators from the network, so throughput couldn't be increased immediately.

Fly: So, the dynamic sharding allows TON to theoretically handle an unlimited number of requests simultaneously and place them into a queue. However, the queued messages need to be processed by validators. With an instant spike in incoming messages, some validators might get stuck, resulting in the entire network becoming stuck. Is my interpretation correct?

&rey: Theoretically, if some validators aren't creating blocks fast enough, others should do that. I'm not sure whether it is implemented, though. (reply to 39083)

&rey: And if validation is too slow, that can result in network failure.

Fly: If that is the case, what if a validator dropped out suddenly? will the processing messages be disappeared?

Asya: Hi everyone, really need some help with a question  there are 2 transactions: - first https://tonscan.org/tx/2jE6OLpZx8vN8-aEdK1Je_ufO15OJ57F0_VFkqU_p_M= - second https://tonscan.org/tx/UDuNmCMiBa01wcfB_1LjxTnLEPa3nPEevsjWghFiChE=  According to all our checks and research, they are identical (except for the initialization of the address in the second TX and its absence in the first)  But the first transaction was successful and the funds were credited to the recipient‚Äôs address, while the second transaction was successful without funds being credited to the recipient‚Äôs address EQAEnDRbX2qGnLTqWcmrXqXYuBb6F5OSv2DB6VkJroH4NL86 (499.9925 TON just disappeared somewhere, they are not at the sender‚Äôs address nor did they reach the recipient‚Äôs address)  We really need to find out why that‚Äôs happened and where did the funds go, appreciate any help here)   Could that be because of a slowdown in transaction processing according to ‚ÄòTON Technical Incident Report‚Äô? If so, quite some time has passed since the second tx was sent, shouldn‚Äôt the funds be credited already?

Maxwell: What's the best practice to get all transactions from TON in time sequence?  like extract all txs from [startBlockId, endBlockId] for futher development.  In other blockchains, it can simple be done by call getBlock and getTransaction, but in TON, the blockId consists of (workchainId, ShardId, Seqno), and the same workchain could have multiple shards.

Tim: What link (reply to 39151)

Tim: ?

Behrang: I haven't done it myself but I think this is a good approximation:  1- Find master chain block with a starting sequence number, let's say 1.  2- Then read the next master chain block with the next sequence number, 2 in this example.  3- Find all shard chains in between from this second master chain block.  4- Read transactions from each shard chain block number found in previous step sequentially, until all shard chains and all transactions are processed.  5- Then repeat this process by moving to the next master chain block.

Behrang: This is a configuration available on ton.org website and it lists initial liteservers. Since wallets where using this config to find liteservers, I guess they disabled it to stop flood of new messages getting queued.  This has nothing to do with network configuration that is stored and available on-chain. (reply to 39179)

As you can see from the two screenshots below, the HEX never changes, but I am getting two different addresses for Bounceable and non-bounceable. I used https://ton.org/address/ to get the information in the screenshot.  If I use TonConnect, the address that appears is the one that ends in jETJ. If I check on https://testnet.tonscan.org/, the address is the one that ends in KKG. Also using the mnemonicToKeyPair function of the library tonweb-mnemonic, the account is the one that ends in KKG.  Can you help me understand these differences and how to parse from KKG to jETJ please?  Thank you

Sleapy: Hi, probably a noob question but when is the state of a block shard available ? On each masterchain block or before ? for example, and we see it more often now than in normal condition, between two masterchain blocks we can have several blocks for a specific shard. if I take block 34716007 and 34716008 on masterchain for reference, on the shard (0,e800000000000000) we see that the last seqno is 40573163 for block 34716007 and 40573165 for block 34716008.  is it possible to have the state of block seqno 40573164 before I get 40573165 ?

Mehdi: Silly question: How much time have you set aside to master TL-B,Bag of Cell and Merkel proof ? What's going on? I assumed myself to be talented until I reached this complexity. It's not value; code must be written first for humans, not machines. No tutorial, no documentation, no analogy‚Äîevery page directs me to another page. Finally, I find myself in pure mathematic, I need help or I run away from this community without look at behind .

Mehdi: Who called this technology The Open Network(TON), come here and be accountable, this is a The Complex Russian Network(TCRN) rather than an The Open Network something like (KGB), I learned Russian in this group and that Russian group, but I am stuck in the basics of technology.  Now I understand why America was against this and was right.  Until you solve this simplification problem, this network will not go further than the cold of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Now some cold-blooded Russians come like Putin and say that this technology does not need you and your ilk.  Go after your work.

Dennis: Documentation is hard, low hanging fruit gives the most value (what people need most). If there are aspects you don't grasp, you can either ask normally, or run it through a GPT and ask

Daniil: you don't actually need most of what you find "hard" in TON. and the basics are mostly simple and don't require extensive math and CS knowledge. (reply to 39384)

Mehdi: Sir, the person who gives you feedback is ahead of normal person , he is actually your friend, GPT chat is also an illusion and hallucination I have gone all the way, this is my last attempt to ask you for help. This is not meant to be low-level, this must consider basic . And should be open and easy for everyone to grasp (reply to 39387)

Tim: Docs.ton.org is pretty good, I don't understand what exactly do you want

Mehdi: This is main mindset in TON community that makes big dificiency ,I encounter very place with this mindset between seniors , I am sure , with respect, that this mindset is completely wrong, all web3 ecosystem is about trustless .How you tag this concept not basic and said you don't need them , you can not find a line in TON dev without relation with this concept.  If you seek just for operator and monopoly you are right . (reply to 39388)

Mehdi: I don't know how dB in all system works? How in TVM scop we can access to outside cells , how cells and bag of cells would organized .

Mehdi: I knew , because if you check other Blockchain you find main projects from all around the words , how about TON? (reply to 39394)

Mehdi: 200 account is full of TON , at least spend some of them for simplicity hard concepts, don't consider it as huge . This is first simple step for every community

Mehdi: I address this problem some other place like these following link , all response are same . Not every developer have courage to told you truth , they simply attract other community, take these advice seriously and make action please .

Mehdi: https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/374#issuecomment-1850372772

Dennis: I don't think your "either help me or I'll fuck off" attitude really helps. I mean, post a concrete question, and people can answer. You can't demand time of anyone. Just my 2c.

Mehdi: You can search the chat history to see some of my unanswered questions, I don't think you all understand the concepts either, but just pretend.  If you can't describe concepts in simple words, it means you don't know it either.  Wherever the documents mentioned only a few know this üòÇ, and it's a shame to even be proud of it

Mehdi: My dear friends, this is not a personal issue, my point is clear and it is related to a basic principles for the community growth.  Its audience is the main decision makers, not you.  Accessible education helps us all.  Obviously teaching fundamental concepts  is not on the agenda at all,  Community maturity is for everyone's benefit.  Please, if you don't support it, at least don't oppose it either , it's very simple, please don't complicate it.

And why do you expect people to put 45 minutes for you? I've put more than 6 months just to learn the basics. This is what it is, the documentation is poor, but it's improving. If you fill it's not good enough, then come again the next year, or the year after that! Even though it's harder to learn at this stage and this point in time, the reward is also bigger.  Also your tone is not friendly. I think that's why you're banned. (reply to 39402)

Mehdi: I thank you , this answer is what I guessed but not sure. and this fact should be considered seriously by decision makers , why someone who spend 6 month to learn basics , should teach others in 6 hours, (reply to 39411)

Behrang: My point was not about that I don't want to teach others. My point is that even if I do want to teach others, first I have to learn more, and then it takes some time to teach. This is how the community grows over time.  BTW, that 6 months is lower now, because of more documentation/learning materials. I think that 6 months can be achieved in 3 or 4 months now.

Jack: Hi all! I'm a bit stuck with something and would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions.  I have a question about using Botfather for WebApp registration. I know how to register an app and share it externally using the format t.me/BOT_NAME/APP_NAME. However, I'm wondering how to share a more detailed page within the web app. Is it possible to do something like t.me/BOT_NAME/APP_NAME/DETAIL_PAGE? It seems that this format doesn't work. Should I register the detailed page through Botfather as a separate WebApp and then share it using t.me/BOT_NAME/DETAIL_PAGE? Or is there a better way to do this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Original: Hello everybody, here i read:  https://docs.ton.org/learn/networking/adnl#adnl-address The ADNL Protocol allows you to send (unreliable) and receive datagrams using only ADNL Addresses. IP Addresses and Ports are hidden by the ADNL Protocol.  But then here i read:  https://docs.ton.org/participate/web3/sites-and-proxy#recommendations Since anonymity will only be available in TON Proxy 2.0, if you do not want to disclose the IP address of your web server, you can do it in two ways:  Run a reverse proxy on a separate server with -R flag as described above.  Make a duplicate server with copy of your website and run reverse proxy locally.  Does it means that there is a way to disclose the IP address of each ADNL address even if it is hidden by default?  Can also full node IP addresses be disclosed from ADNL addresses?

Mehdi: works every where üòéüòÅ

Mehdi: if you write three backticks followed by code of language like c , cpp, Rust , python  , everywhere that markdown file supported , you will have highlighted syntax code block , for example in GitHub , notion ,telegram , and other blog platform like daily_dev and hash node, This makes reading code much more convenient

Mehdi: this will converted to

Mehdi: This , with simple trick

Mehdi: of course we have tree sitter and syntax highlighting project  for func under dev , but till adoption in other plaform this helps

Mehdi: This is for markdown file , one other simple trick for raw code, for example in GitHub repo is  , for example my_code.fc to be highlighted is naming it as my_code_Func.cpp , result is we have both indication that this file is written in Func language but as bonus we have syntax highlighted code as well .

Mehdi: you can see difference for elector code here,raw code and here with trick(highlithed)

Falco: Did you change the path from /var/ton-work to something else?   I think it's better if you leave it intact and just use a symlink if you want to store it on some other location. So the validator (and other services) still think it's on that /var/ton-work directory. (reply to 39507)

Mehdi: Hi friends , Does anybody knows what the purpose of ton20 is? Assume we mint Deploy transfer bla bla and others do as well,  what's next? I mean what real use case it might have? So far we know it produce co¬≤ and bring award for validator and populated network. Not big deal , what's next? I think blockchain is a piece of software which aim to solved humans kind problems somehow,  but base of its protocol definition I can not find any answer but as community and also some big head supported it , I guess I am wrong it should have a real usecase

Daniil: ton20 is a practically useless standard which was adapted from bitcoin to TON just to make some hype (it succeed in that).  Use TEP-74 jettons instead as tokens. (reply to 39512)

Mehdi: I remember guy who was working on it , had received a message from github and they ask for some more line of code in its platform for adoption (reply to 39510)

Mehdi: Are u sure? I know in even bitcoin it assumed to be nasty useless , I am wondering why it gain credit . If you analyse design of smart contracts ,  it is obvious they know bit about how ton works, also their  developer have not known in community,  it seems mysterious , (reply to 39513)

Daniil: that's just what I said: ton20 is a useless standard (reply to 39516)

&rey: I have thought ton20 didn't have a single smart contract? (reply to 39516)

Falco: I think it's being used in the code to check that status

Sam: Ahh that would be why - while testing I was using a different service name (reply to 39522)

Falco: Yep that's the reason then :)

Sam: Thank you! Looks good now

Sam: Any idea why Validator index would still be showing as -1?  Is it just bc it isn't currently a validator? (reply to 39525)

Daniil: ton20 standard doesn't have any smart contracts involved in its logic. (reply to 39531)

Mehdi: I don't think so , we can consider it as stress test tool after incidents and be happy.  But it doesn't mean it is a tool in fact  . Ton as a system like any other system has its own characteristics limitation,  what it means? We can have two power by 32 account in just one workchain . So in normal development design we should  use platform principle architecture design,  here it is sharding or load balancing . On other side that is related to resiliency of network we should consider measurement just discard message that orginated from account who do not know this network. (reply to 39519)

Mehdi: This is wrong,  if we have transaction,  smart contract is prerequisite.  What you call smart contract , we use address , actor, smart contract , account interchangeably . This comes from official document website , if you curious I can send you its link (reply to 39533)

Mehdi: Now a days , TON development approach is to adjust capacity of processing one account inbox message.  It means we are amend unknown company fault. This is wrong.  We must know our limitation,  and force it as our principle design.In this case network works and bad actor( intentionally or non intentionally)learn .

Daniil: you're correct. but I mean that their standard doesn't require any smart-contracts apart from user's wallet itself.  for example, Jettons standard utilises minters and wallets. NFTs utilise collections and items. (reply to 39535)

Mehdi: Every messages,  both internally or externally processes by validator . Ton has special way , to reach conclusion and commit block , and discarding message that want to excess capacity of one entity is just about a single if check which arise error . If we do not change our policy,  sure we have catastrophic incident more and more . Now you senior guys help me to expand basic knowledge needed to enrich community knowledge. I am here just 30 days and do not write a line of code , because how one can write code when he don't know basics primitive of system I mean low level staff ,so please go this link and want to open this unfair closed bounty. Community has power,  do not under estimated it

Daniil: You don‚Äôt have to understand some system deeply on a low level to write something for it. (reply to 39538)

Mehdi: I am sure , you don't believe what you said , but I am not sure what intention or motivation reside beneath your point of view,  sorry but knowing low level staff if not necessary,  accept that help extraordinary!  Now the question is why you insist on your point. Long story short , are you OK to help expanding opportunity such that developers learn low level staff by ease. (reply to 39539)

Daniil: I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt learn. I‚Äôm just saying that you can try being more practical instead of theoretical when it comes to software development. (reply to 39541)

Mehdi: I am responsible for writing a article for community,  I search all around Web,  I read all document , see all youtube,  ask my question in every group , guess what happen ? I forced to read main repo to find my answer , and I can not find it yet. So what was article? How manage gas! It was issue 5, now we are issue 400 , this issue have no applicant for 5 month , its reward was 500 $. So tell me does gas usage  is neglectable? Or why you that implement bounty more than any other do not do this . And final question are you plan , every developers do same as me ,This is community on boarding policy!?or should it changes!?

Mehdi: The point is clear , this is not personal issue , this is about community !  If comes to personality I admire and respect you more than anyone,  but my point is another story,  I strongly believe knowing low level staff  should be  in hand of anybody by ease . And this perspective has beneficial for all , without any doubt.  This is not impossible and not even big deal ,it is also very simple . A animation film that start from hash function,  go through actor model,explain how double spending is solved here , stack machine,  async programing , TLB , BoC, Merkel proof , and so on .  Its prompt is, please explain these  as I am 5 ,and  Done!

Farrukh: Greetings  Together with the team, we began to develop an ‚Äúobserver‚Äù of transactions in the TON network  A little off-topic When observers wrote on the ETH, BTC and TRX networks, the basis of the logic was block scanning. By scanning the blocks, we went through the transactions in them and, according to the business log, parsed the wallets that participated in these transactions. Accordingly, if we found wallets in transactions that interested us, we sent various alerts.  Now we started studying the TON network and found that this approach (as if) would not work here  Business requirement: When funds arrive in wallets (there can be more than 10 million), send notifications about a new transaction  Question: Is it possible, just like in other blockchains, to scan blocks in the TON network?

–ß–∏–æ–Ω–≥: Let the audit department take care of how much money to transfer. Our community has a lot of work to do, not just waiting for 10 million.

–ß–∏–æ–Ω–≥: Remember one thing, everything can be fixed but the community needs to have enough resources.  Take advantage of what everyone has.

User<6869304807>: Het there , any ton dev who wants to join our team for building educational platform with ton connect and web app?

Creature: Hello. @Gusarich Are you there?

Aydin: IMHO, the best practice should include  (but not necessarily limited to) the following:  1. Make the system composable by separating the external messages from the rest, and let the wallets handle the externals. This way, other non-wallet contracts won't have to take care of the off-chain issues.  2. Following an external message,  let the wallets send some "trigger" internal messages to other relevant contracts which contain the rest of the business logic.  3. This way, tracking the external-to-internal triggers becomes much easier by monitoring the internal trigger messages from the wallets to the non-wallets. (reply to 39645)

yi: hi, how to get the tx hash after transaction submitted using ton sdk or other js lib?

TON Answers Bot (not AI): Withdraw fee coverage from Vitali Kachan  Hi there.  In my app I allow deposit and withdraw some Jetton. I would like to implement withdrawal in such way that user compensate transaction fee (something like 0.05 TON for Jetton transfer). I have several ways to implement it using tonSDK like: - ask transfer 0.05 TON to may wallet and then send Jettons - as Jetton has fixed rate to ton - convert fee to Jetton and take it from withdrawal - add some entity like withdrawal token - user buy some withdrawal tokens amount and then can use it to withdraw Jetton.  But I feel it could be done simpler, like built in feature or may be some well know smart contract, but I'm quite new it this topic.  Could you suggest me something?  üîó Answer on TON Overflow

Mehdi: There are some library that can communicate with network , for deploy contract you need access to code and its data , all data structure in TON is made of Cell , you can find how transfer your smart contract to data structure  and deploy them with those library or SDK ,we have ts,go,py, kotlin among other , of course blueprint itself depend on those library ,

≈Åukasz: Oh ok

≈Åukasz: Cell.hash / cell_hash compute a different hash from the one CHKSIGNS does

≈Åukasz: That, or signVerify hashes its first argument too. Anyway, replacing foo.hash() with foo.beginParse().loadBuffer(foo_size_in_bytes) worked.

miami: gm guys

Howard: awesome (reply to 40296)

Howard: One question: how do we track NFT item information? Let's say it involves scanning and updating the NFT information based on each block transaction, such as listing, selling, transferring status, etc.

Howard: I remember we can use: NFT SDK(https://github.com/ton-community/nft-sdk/tree/main/examples), or using TON API to do so? What else?

Daria: How does the deployment of the contract take place in TON?   For example, contract A sent contract B a message with a state init and body, if the hash from state init matches the address of B, then the contract code from state init will simply be executed with the received message body?

Daria: And what happens if hash of this state_init doesnt matches the address of B?

Behrang: Yeah, mostly.  First, contract will be deployed (if it's not already deployed). That means that code and data are deployed from the state_init.  Then the message will be delivered to the contract. (reply to 40304)

Behrang: The transaction will fail. (reply to 40305)

&rey: You may start on https://docs.ton.org. (reply to 40471)

MonoBit: Hi guys I am trying to update the code of my contract using set_code, but nothing happens. I have some fundamental questions 1. Does it change the address of the current contract 2. Does the set_code primitive give me access to new code functions, ... ? 3. I already have the function "A" inside my contract. I was wondering what would happen after calling set_c3.  Updates the current value of¬†c3. Usually, it is used for updating smart contract codes in runtime. Note that after execution of this primitive, the current code (and the stack of recursive function calls) won't change, but any other function call will use a function from the new code.  If the new code has function A, is it possible to call the new code's function A?  And if there is another function, let's say B, in the new code, how to call this new function?    4. I have seen some other examples referenced in docs. They call send_message_back after set_code. Why is that for?

play of the game: Hi everyone I was wondering, how do inputs of recv_internal (or external) work?  For example if I want to get op code of an incoming message, can I put an input? ( Like recv_external(int op)) Or should I just read the first 32 bits of data?

MonoBit: each of the following recv_internal declarations is correct, but those with fewer variables will spend slightly less gas (each unused argument adds additional DROP instructions).  () recv_internal(int balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_cell, slice in_msg) {} () recv_internal(int msg_value, cell in_msg_cell, slice in_msg) {} () recv_internal(cell in_msg_cell, slice in_msg) {} () recv_internal(slice in_msg) {} You have to parse in_msg_body to retrieve the op code based on how sender stored op code in the message.  Ususally, it is stored as the first 32 bit inside in_msg_body. (reply to 40482)

play of the game: Thanks a lot Is there any specific source where I can find such details?  Also in the recent challenge there's the following tl-b scheme for an external message: storage$_ public_key:uint256 execution_time:uint32 receiver:MsgAddressInt seqno:uint32 = Storage;  It's supposed to work all the same right? (reply to 40483)

MonoBit: Yw. Yes, check docs.ton.org (reply to 40484)

MonoBit: It's for the data storage of you contract (reply to 40484)

Behrang: 1- No.  2- Not in the current transaction.  3- The map of function ids to their code will be updated. If you have changed the number or order of functions, you may call a wrong function. To fix this, use method_id to fix the id of the function even after update. (reply to 40478)

ÿ¶€ïŸÜ€åŸÖ€é€å ⁄©Ÿàÿ±ÿØ€å: hey guys how can i confirm a transaction with boc?  why tf tonconnect when i confirm a transaction only returns boc  what am i supposed to do with it üòê  in javascript

MonoBit: So, there is no way to access a new function after changing the code? We have to make a new transaction to my_address() and continue the process from where we left off? (reply to 40491)

Behrang: You have to use set_c3 in addition to set_code. (reply to 40497)

MonoBit: Thank you so much (reply to 40498)

Corn: Hi! I have a question and maybe someone here can help me.. regarding ton links and dns domains:  I know how to open foundation.ton with using ton.run, but now I also wanted to use the mytonwallet. I activated the option ton proxy. When I now enter foundation.ton in chrome it just opens the Google results. So how can I open ton links using the mytonwallet extension? Also, there is an option "handle ton:// links". What is this and how does it work? I tried to enter ton://foundation into my browser, but it did not work?  Thanks for any help in advance!

Daniil: You had to add http:// (reply to 40517)

Corn: Ah, thanks! Yes! It works now. Can you also tell me what these ton:// links are? So the option in my ton wallet to "handle ton:// links"? This is something else than the proxy option. (reply to 40518)

Ken: Is it possible to detect whether code is deployed at a specific address in Tact? Such as getting the code size or hash?

Knight!: I am actually confused here :

Knight!: am i reading the values correctly? cause ive no clue whats going on, im unable to log and debug as in usual dev (im new to blockchain, specially funC)

Andy: can you send that in text form? I'll fix it for you

Knight!: () recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {     slice tmp_in_msg = in_msg;     int op = tmp_in_msg~load_uint(32);     int query_id = tmp_in_msg~load_uint(64);          ;; int locked_for = tmp_in_msg~load_uint(32);

Knight!: thanks!

Andy: the locked_for and seqno are stored in a reference, but you are not loading the reference

Knight!: i have actually commented that part to process them under specific operation codes

Knight!: *maybe im wrong* (reply to 40766)

Andy: Here is the code with a bit of explanation. You technically don't need to copy in_msg to tmp_in_msg and to signature but this gets the point across well. slice tmp_in_msg = in_msg; int op = tmp_in_msg~load_uint(32); int query_id = tmp_in_msg~load_uint(64);  ;; Load the reference ;; `begin_parse` converts the reference `cell` to `slice` ;; `cell` for storing, `slice` for reading, `builder` for building cells. slice reference = tmp_in_msg~load_ref().begin_parse();  ;; Load the values from the reference int locked_for = reference~load_uint(32); int new_seqno = reference~load_uint(32);  ;; The signature will be the leftover 512 bits from the previous slice slice signature = tmp_in_msg;

Knight!: i kind of get it, thank you so much but why is signature listed before the reference?? (reply to 40756)

Andy: well, my guess would be: you need the entirety of the reference to do a signature check later, and you can't sign a cell that you have to put your signature inside of :) so the signature has to be outside of the data, and while it could be put in another reference, so it'd be sequentially after the data, there is not really a need, since we still have data bits in the original cell left, so we just store it there as that's more optimized than unnecessary references

Knight!: Okay! This was helpful, Thanks!

Mehdi: I am wondering, blockchain is hard , TON is harder , and editorial is . ..  is it possible to  put simpler sentences ,shorter , smoother , minimum ambiguity etc.

Den: Hi team, I am working for an exchange.   The new address will start with UQ instead of EQ, and the last four letters will change too. However, would the old addresses work or they will be invalidated?

Den: @SwiftAdviser

Mehdi: Those things should be handled carefully due to the fact that some fields have variable sizes. how handle carefully? this is about message layout and variable field , we should check every variable size field prefex one by one and decide accordingly or it is some better way ?

Mehdi: This is description of  mode 64 , Carry all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message what it means , new message refer to who ,value is not something that validator can rewrite , so what initially indicate means?  we put some value there , and send message , what inbound message here refer to , is it mean incoming message or outgoing message , how they can indicate initially and then by mode it will change , or maybe we should guess all of them and hope we have correct guess

Mehdi: flag +1 it said Pay transfer fees separately from the message value , let say we have 3 smart contract which work together , this message value  here is about action message (message after processing inbound message ) or just  send_raw_message , is it apply for master contract or can be used down the road too

&rey: Let's say we are processing message with value 1.1 TON. Our contract spends 0.1 TON for storage and computations and then sends message with value 3 TON and mode 64.  Message gets sent with value 4 TON. (reply to 40834)

Mehdi: flag +2 said Ignore any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase , if we ignore errors what happen for state , bounce , commit , outgoing message , all will be apply , ignored , some yes , some no ,

Mehdi: For internal message layout we have  technical discussion , for external , it said it  does not need to be as standardized (written by different developers and managed by different owners) , my question is about how we should deal with op code . In TL-B , we have arbitary hex number act as tag or id of schema (after #), but no where we have any clue(or maybe I can not find) that this is op code , and we can access it by calling  op = msg.load_unit(32) (simplified) ,I mean it seems it is convention , and used every where , but why this is not mentioned anywhere ,All information we have is this note : In general, an external message begins with a 256-bit signature (if needed), a 32-bit req-seqno (if needed), a 32-bit expire-at (if needed), and possibly a 32-bit op and other required parameters depending on op. The layout of external messages does not need to be as standardized as that of internal messages because external messages are not used for interaction between different smart contracts (written by different developers and managed by different owners). from this page

Jarek: for those who face same issue, the issue ends up my function is declared under where the function is being called in the contract. it can still be compiled though (reply to 40803)

Gulolio: Guys if I parse an address like this,   var (int wc, int address_bits) = parse_std_addr(address);  How can I do the opposite? Having wc the workchain, and the address_bits to obtain the original address. Is it possible?

&rey: .store_uint(4, 3).store_uint(wc, 8).store_uint(address_bits, 256) ‚Äî> address in a builder. (reply to 40868)

Gulolio: Awesome

Gulolio: I'm confused by these sentence in the tsc5,  The contract should send out to all users according to their shares. You should send messages to the address of your token jack jetton_address according to TEP-0074.  Message Value: 0.02 TON Response address must be equal to the recipient address Forward_amount = 1 nanoTON Without custom_payload / without forward_payload.  Specifically the  send messages to the address of your token jack jetton_address , token jack jetton_address? What this means? Who is Jack?üòÇ Reading the TEP-0074, I have the impression I have to send a message in this form  () send_jetton(int query_id, int amount, slice to, int mode) impure inline_ref {     cell msg = begin_cell()         .store_uint(0xf8a7ea5, 32) ;; op defined in TEP-0074         .store_uint(query_id, 64)         .store_coins(amount)         .store_slice(to) ;; destination         .store_slice(to) ;; response address         ;; without custom payload         .store_coins(1) ;; forward ton amount         ;; without forward payload     .end_cell();           send_simple_message(jetton::msg_value,to , msg, mode); }  But I still don't know what it's refered as token jack jetton_address. If anyone can shed a light on this.

On my local server it works fine but when I try to deploy to GitHub pages or netilfy I get a type incompatible error.

Samyar: is there a tonweb group chat? i have specific questions about it

Samyar: the tokens are not transferred in this code  it replays that the transaction was successful and it's but when i check the transaction (the second image) the token value is 0 :\

Gulolio: In the tsc5 task2, when they refer to "shares" they mean the percentage a given user it's entitled to? For example, let's suppose that the contract has 500 tons, and we have two users, user1: 30 shares, user2: 70 shares. Does that mean that user1 it's entitled to 30 % of the tons of the contract and user2 to the 70 %?? Or shares literally means amount of tons that a given user it's entitled to?

Kenny$$Shillz: Please try now as I believe I have fixed it only you have to refresh after connecting ... Also it should charge 2.7 test ton... (reply to 40898)

Kenny$$Shillz: The problem I face was I was working with a beta version of to connect

Kenny$$Shillz: TonConnectUI/react

Facu: This is the documentation: https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/typescript/tma-js-sdk-react#launch-parameters  As I am investigating seems to me a "bug/no well supported feature", the async option.  Basically needs to wait for window.Telegram.WebApp to have a value. Maybe something is slower in android and generates that timeout.

User<6955603556>: i want to call a function of smart contract in js, can you help me ? (reply to 41102)

not: i am trying to use typescript to make a template literal string to be passed as a memo in a TON tx and i am getting a BitString overflow issue. has anyone any luck with solving such a thing?

not: i am constructing a payload like this  payload:  `string here ${value} {"other": "json"},`

Gulolio: In task3 of tsc5, there's the following TL-B scheme _ new_version:uint32 migration_code:(Maybe ^Cell) = MigrationPayload; _ expected_version:uint32 new_code:(Maybe ^Cell) migrations:(HashmapE 32 MigrationPayload) payload:^Cell = InternalMsgBody;  And later in the description, they refer to the `migrations` dictionary as:  When handling incoming messages in your wrapper (the extra layer you're adding for versioning), you will have a "migration dictionary". This is a list of which versions need storage migration  My confusion it's, in the MigrationPayload scheme, there's one element called migration_code not migration storage or anything that refers to storage. It's ok to assume that this migration_code it's the storage migration they are referring to on the quoted text??

‚Äî 2024-01-05 ‚Äî

Ë£∏Ë£∏: hello sir.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I want request this:  https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/getBlockTransactions?workchain=0&shard=8000000000000000&seqno=17095035&root_hash=8bbb1d9b8ebe77d57792d13e35f36a361d633735e948aa170e1fa804cbdbccb5&count=40  It can work very good.  while my code is use the tonapi-go pkg. it provide the apis https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/api-v2

Ë£∏Ë£∏: so my question is. how to use the apis in the https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/api-v2 to get the same result of the   https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/getBlockTransactions?workchain=0&shard=8000000000000000&seqno=17095035&root_hash=8bbb1d9b8ebe77d57792d13e35f36a361d633735e948aa170e1fa804cbdbccb5&count=40

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I don't want to use two sdk. so...

R: What

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I means this.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: this is the api in https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/#/blocks/get_block_transactions_getBlockTransactions_get

Ë£∏Ë£∏: while I want use this: https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/api-v2

Ë£∏Ë£∏: to get the same result.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: so how to use.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: because all the old code is use this https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/api-v2

Ë£∏Ë£∏: while I really need the function like api in that picture.

Luke: is there an equivalent NULLSWAPIF that returns 0 or some other int instead of null?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: https://github.com/tonkeeper/tongo/issues/227

Ë£∏Ë£∏: help

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Is there any dev can help me in this group?

Howard: fuckkkk basically we have to put String as Slice DataType and put in here right (reply to 41057)

Philip Ëè≤Âäõ: simply use liteclient then iterate though all hashs you want (reply to 41130)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: what is liteclient?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I only use one client in my project I think it is enouth.

Philip Ëè≤Âäõ: yeah using restful api provided from others is also enough, so it depends on your use case

Ë£∏Ë£∏: but how to use and use which api. I cannot find it in the doc.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: may be you can tell me use which api and give me a demo http url.

Philip Ëè≤Âäõ: sure, maybe after work

Ë£∏Ë£∏: thank you. you are very nice.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: while I need it at once because it blocked my job for about two hours. so Is there any other nice developer can help me.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I am thinking about using another API system, so my project will have two sets of API systems. In the future, when I need to buy services, I will have to pay for both sets of API services, and that's definitely not possible. So, if I switch to the other API, I will gradually cancel the current API I'm using and only use the new one. This means I have to make some changes to the code, and I'm not sure if there will be new difficulties waiting for me. Therefore, it's a difficult decision, and I hope everyone can help me. Thank you.

User<6955603556>: what is gasless transactions ? where can i read more about it ? there is gasless transaction in ton roadmap, what is exactly ?

Andy: migration_code contains the code that you need to call to update the storage (reply to 41111)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Since no one is helping me, I'll temporarily use the functionalities from https://toncenter.com/. It will give my project two sets of keys, and I feel like it should be fine.

ninja: hey devs, I transferred 0.1 TON from this wallet to some other wallet, you can see the current balance is 0 But the transaction hash hasn't appeared in the explorer  The wallet wasn't deployed before making the transaction, is that the reason for this failure?

ninja: there is no trace of the funds in the explorer

ninja: the other explorer shows this,   I just executed one transaction programatically  using @orbs-network/ton-access as rpc

ninja: also why is the first deposit labeled SCAM?

ninja: correct me if wrong, these are all network fees since I wanted to transfer 0.1 ton and didn't consider network fees  What is the ideal approach, also why did it kept trying when failed first time? (reply to 41161)

Fellow J: Hello

Fellow J: Any idea why the state shows inactive and the total amount in wallet doesn't show the ton value yet?

Fellow J: Do I need to wait for it to be active?

&rey: If wallet is uninitialized, it will return null. You should do ?? 0 then. (reply to 41156)

ÁøªÊñóËä±Âõ≠Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊ∑±ÊÉÖ: const TonWeb = require('tonweb');  const tonweb = new TonWeb(new TonWeb.HttpProvider('https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC', {apiKey: '3b617d26c48aebc729cf5c4601f4732c0cf14331674ad4762e419180704d1330'}));  const wallet = tonweb.wallet.create({address: 'EQAI9IoJmk--P5U9i4wa3UpI0juy-zcF-vJclvWS5NUa58Vh'});  async function sendTransfer() {       console.log(tonweb)     const seqno = await wallet.methods.seqno().call();      console.log(seqno); }  sendTransfer();

&rey: 1. Inactive because blockchain doesn't contain its code yet. You need to deploy the contract for it to work; if it's wallet, it will be deployed on first outgoing transfer by any library you use; any contract can also be deployed by incoming internal message with provided stateInit. (reply to 41167)

&rey: Are you familiar with ?? JS operator? (reply to 41170)

ÁøªÊñóËä±Âõ≠Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊ∑±ÊÉÖ: Do I need to call a method on tonweb to activate this address?

&rey: Outgoing transfer will do that. (reply to 41174)

ÁøªÊñóËä±Âõ≠Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊ∑±ÊÉÖ: I have already transferred money to this address

&rey: Yes, and money is there. How the contract would become init when money is transferred? (reply to 41176)

Fellow J: How to create that first outgoing transfer by any library if it's a wallet? (reply to 41172)

&rey: It looks like transactions failed so that seqno protection didn't work. This may be caused by outgoing messages trying to take more value than there is. You should ensure that outgoing messages have flag 2 (SEND_IGNORE_ERRORS). (reply to 41163)

&rey: Please refer to the documentation https://docs.ton.org. There are tutorials for several libraries IIRC. (reply to 41178)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Hello, what module should I add to get the WalletContractV4R2 to get the format used in Tonkeeper ? Currently there's only WalletContractV4 from (@ton/ton)

ÁøªÊñóËä±Âõ≠Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊ∑±ÊÉÖ: You must obtain seqno before transferring money, but when I call the tonweb SDK method to obtain seqno, it is null. I don‚Äôt understand whether there is a problem with my code or what other operations need to be done.

&rey: When seqno is null, it shall be replaced with zero. (reply to 41182)

ÁøªÊñóËä±Âõ≠Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊ∑±ÊÉÖ: ok   i try again

&rey: Does it return other address? (v4r1 was deprecated because it was hard to use without get-methods) (reply to 41181)

ÁøªÊñóËä±Âõ≠Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊ∑±ÊÉÖ: thanks

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Review your implementation carefully, making sure to follow these steps. It's crucial to obtain the sequence number (seqno) before proceeding: Note that you most get the seqno first 1. const seqno = await WalletContract.getSeqno(); //Outside your whileloop if are useing try() it should be outside the try() 2. let currentSeqno = seqno;  //outside the whileloop   3.  while (currentSeqno == seqno) {  //set your while condition like so      console.log("waiting for transaction to confirm...");      await sleep(1500);      currentSeqno = await walletContract.getSeqno();    }    console.log("transaction confirmed!");  } (reply to 41182)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: I can't even find it from @ton/ton module, it only include v1 v3r2...V4 (reply to 41185)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: there's no V4R1 or 2

&rey: Just V4 returns other address? (reply to 41189)

Tim: @ton/ton is v4r2 (reply to 41188)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Yes (reply to 41190)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Or are we suppose to import it from another module ? Because there's only V4 in this module of @ton/ton (reply to 41190)

Howard: is there possible to print Address in String? (reply to 41056)

Andrey: You need to store address to slice with   slice my_cs = ‚ÄúEQATqIQLRMCQ9IyrByFLNvHP_iYr4encZF1M8li9KIOG0fL_‚Äùa  Than you can use (int wc, int addr) = parse_std_addr(my_cs);  wc and addr are int with base 10. Next you need to convert wc to utf8 char and address to hex and then to utf8 char string.   For hex convertation:  (use smth like this)  But don‚Äôt forget to zero fill result, because encode_number_to_text(addr, 16) will skip first zeroes in any hex form address (so hex address 000‚Ä¶0001 will be just `1`). You need to pad with zero to 64 symbols.  After success convertation you need to concat slices (wc + ‚Äú:‚Äù + addr) to final string (reply to 41054)

Samyar: https://answers.ton.org/question/1654418338874396672/transfer-jetton-destination-address-is-not-useable

&rey: slice my_cs = "EQATqIQLRMCQ9IyrByFLNvHP_iYr4encZF1M8li9KIOG0fL_"a; works as well. (reply to 41198)

Howard: I am stuck in Tact level that; we only have:  myAddress().asSlice() (reply to 41200)

&rey: And it's possible to avoid slice concatenation by storing everything into single builder. (reply to 41200)

Howard: Sorry, I am confusing right now. To solve this:  - You need to know how Address data type can convert to other data type - You need to know what is slice, cell, and string data type (reply to 41198)

Andrey: All comes simple, when you understand basic of TON (cells / slices).   In Func (actually in TVM, because Func is just sugar with some optimizations to TMV OP codes) there‚Äôs no custom types and objects. You operate only with int, slice, cell, builder, tuple (there are other types, but they pro level, you never use them irl).  So all you have is very big integers and bits that are separated into cells/slices which are refer to other cell/slice.  Now as we know basic - answer is simple: there is no such thing as string data type or address data type inside func. You only have bit-representation of such things. For bit representations you use TLB schemes and operate with integers, slices, cells for them.  So ‚ÄúEQATqIQLRMCQ9IyrByFLNvHP_iYr4encZF1M8li9KIOG0fL_‚Äùa uses Std address tlb scheme to create slice (all func string literals create slices) of such address. And such tlb schema (actually 2 of them, but you don‚Äôt use irl second) is only way to correct store address inside TVM. You actually can create own way of store, but all std functions operate with basic TLB schemes (as `parse_std_addr`).  (int wc, int addr) = parse_std_addr(my_cs); is just ‚Äúfast bit extractor to two integers with usage of std address tlb scheme‚Äù because actually what you need from address is workchain and hex (stateinit hash) part. Devs are using them to calculate access levels or validate something.  So all you need to know is what is TVM, what is cell and how TVM operate with them: https://docs.ton.org/tvm.pdf you can start with 1.1 (reply to 41203)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: I'll give that a check when am back on pc

Dmitry: hey guys is it possible to:  1) get KYC status for specific TON wallet via API? 2) get country of the user for said KYC via API?

&rey: KYC status with respect to what service? TON, The Open Network, doesn't have integrated KYC for smart contracts. (reply to 41232)

Dmitry: I need to understand if I can fetch the fact if certain user with @wallet has passed KYC with wallet and Ideally to understand user country based on said KYC (from @wallet) (reply to 41233)

&rey: I think that's unlikely. (reply to 41234)

Dmitry: how to raise a change request for it? it would be very useful tool

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Do you mean ( If its possible to have a contract that can verify other wallet address, to show their status as verified or not verified by a service?) (reply to 41234)

Dmitry: having a smart contract for this would be nice but for now I need to understand if I can call Telegram API (centralized) directly to know KYC status for certain wallet (reply to 41237)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: No you can't (reply to 41238)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: And telegram doesn't do kyc or collect users data for that, so basically you'll need to create your own app to do that.  It may be helpful when there's a service that requires to know if their users are real. Then the users will have to go to your website for kyc and any service that require to know the authenticity of a wallet will hold you as a trusted supplier.

Dmitry: it does, though (reply to 41240)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Isn't that KYC for P2P trading ? (reply to 41241)

Dmitry: not sure, but this thing could be very useful. so I need to know if I can access this data (not KYC details, just the fact if user passed or not)  if it is not possible to access, I'd love to know how to get developers attention to this, as it could be used in many apps

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: You can't access that data. But you'd be able to see the KYC status of someone that places a buy or sell order in  P2P market within the webapp is kycd (reply to 41244)

Dmitry: if its possible to access the fact that user has passed KYC in webapp, it means there should be some API to show KYC status  thats exactly what I need (reply to 41245)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: I'm not sure I you're following the idea behind  kyc (Know Your Customer) not share your customers data. Even if there's an API they'll only share the status of a wallet with a partnered service not make it open for everyone to see. (reply to 41246)

Dmitry: I am very familiar with KYC and Sumsub KYC they have.  I dont need to know user data (sex, age, name, etc) I just need to know if a certain wallet has passed KYC or not   if wallet passed KYC it is already a good indicator that user is probably not a bot and I can use this fact in my app (reply to 41247)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Well you can talk to @wallet team for that. (reply to 41249)

Dmitry: Thanks! where I can find these guys? :)

Dmitry: asked wallet support already but would love to get a real dev there to pitch them this idea

&rey: Please note that KYC verification fact will not be available in blockchain. If you choose to use that data, you'll lose decentralization, and I wouldn't do that.

Dmitry: it is possible to implement KYC in blockchain too in fact, it is quite easy to do  just need to have a smart contract which will store ton addresses which has passed KYC  this smart contract could be populated based on user input, i.e. only store this information if user specifically agreed to pay some TX fees for that

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Unless he's building some centralised services to stay on a decentralized network they required user verification and validity. (reply to 41253)

Dmitry: indeed, this smart contract need to be deployed and maintained via wallet team which is centralized entity..  but even in blockcahin you have centralized things like Oracles to fetch data from the real world it would be just kind of an Oracle for KYC

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: This looks like a contract agreement, not what I was thinking üí≠ (reply to 41254)

&rey: But what stops [centralized entity you choose]'s oracle from allowing their own bots ‚Äî for instance, to milk airdrops? (reply to 41256)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Trust and faith is our only hope (reply to 41258)

Dmitry: its a matter of a trust... same trust as you have for USDT what if they create USDT out of thin air? (reply to 41258)

&rey: That's why I have more trust for TON...  It seems that you want to know the country of user. It's one stop from blocking certain countries. I don't want to help in building such projects. (reply to 41261)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: It all comes down to ethics and   hope they don't abide by the rules. (reply to 41261)

Dmitry: I want to create advertising app, and it is critical to know user country at least you usually want to show ads only for certain specific country (as example) (reply to 41262)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: That well you don't need KYC for that (reply to 41264)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Why not just track then with the ip they use when visiting your app?

&rey: If user uses TON Connect 2, you will get request for tonconnect-manifest.json from their device, and that (+ IP) should allow you to determine language/country. (reply to 41264)

&rey: That will allow for all wallets (including non-custodial ones) rather than just @wallet users.  Also, you may introduce a server delay in returning manifest if the request is suspicious (same wallet configuration as with many others).

Gulolio: Guys one question here related to task3 in tsc5. Just to verify if what I'm thinking it's correct, and in case I'm not how can I solve this issue. One of the things that it's required in the task is to "update the contract code" when it's needed. Is it correct to assume the following?  ;; update_code comes in the inbound message, the second argument of the message        ;; set_code will update the contract code after a successful termination of the current run         set_code(update_code);         ;; set_c3 will set the c3, which according to the doc         ;; "Contains the current dictionary, essentially a hashmap containing         ;; the code of all functions used in the program"         ;; So after this call, I could access for example "migrate_one" that it's in the "update_code", right?         set_c3(update_code.begin_parse().bless());         ;; will call "migrate_one" with the current code association in my old c3         ;; in the new code. To avoid this, I've read the it's recommended to fix the         ;; code associated to this method, in both contracts, the new one and the old one.          ;; For example using method_id(1666), I've seen something like this in the elector contract         ;; and in the dns resolver contract. I've put the links bellow.         cell new_storage = migrate_one(old_storage);  Now I think I'm missing something here, because, I have no way to fix "method_id(1666)" in the incoming code, the "update_code" I mean. On my tests when I don't fix this "method_id" to the "migrate_one" and "process_message" as well, I get exit code 11. Which according to the doc it's:  Most oftenly caused by trying to call get-method whose id wasn't found in the code  Links: DNS contract and Elector contract

Andy: basically this updating is dependent on the function order, and as long as the migration code will have all the same functions (not sure if all the functions are needed now that I think about it) in the same order the call will work. that's why the migrate_one is within the <<<<< >>>>> update-able part of the code - its place should not be changed.

I understand the part of <<< and >>>, to replace the last two, but if you had auxiliar functions before these functions, will that matter? For example if you have in this order, fun1, fun2, recv_internal, process_message and migrate_one, would that affect it? (reply to 41324)

Dr. Fomo McMoon: Hey guys

Dr. Fomo McMoon: Quick question here as well, from all the docs it doesnt exactly become clear to me how transactions propagate

Dr. Fomo McMoon: Especially during the 5-6 sec time it takes for them to finalize

black: I didn't find that way

Dr. Fomo McMoon: Is there a mempool on ton or not?

Dr. Fomo McMoon: Or is tx propagation a bit more like solana where all txns go to validators directly

black: Do you know how to use this method? (reply to 41381)

Dr. Fomo McMoon: Not sure but that might be a bit risky (reply to 41386)

Dr. Fomo McMoon: Because sending does not mean it got finalized

Dr. Fomo McMoon: So if u wait until its sent and then try getting it immediately, it could be that its not yet finalized

Dr. Fomo McMoon: At least thats an issue on solana

Dr. Fomo McMoon: So if u have something like "sendAndConfirm", await that instead of maybe put a 7 sec sleep before sending and getting the transaction

SWITCHER | DEV: Hey, how can I get the lp pair address of a smart contract in python/typescript

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: Check the HD wallet function in the docs under wallet (reply to 41486)

Panda: Thanks (reply to 41511)

&rey: Some indexer is required, this data is unavailable onchain. (reply to 41508)

CripticHood | Dropsüíß: I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "instantiate" if you mean interact you can check one of the TWA app tutorials. One enables you to send transaction to a contract to receive tokens and the other shows how you can interact with the counter contract. You should be able to build up an idea from there. (reply to 41506)

SWITCHER | DEV: I still don‚Äôt understand what exactly happens when adding liquidity on TON, i tried deploying and adding LP and there was like 5-6 transactions involved, i want to make a bot that listens for new pairs, but im not sure what to exactly listen on

SWITCHER | DEV: Which event

Chicken Little: and how do you listen to events in the first place üëÄ i havent found a single example showing it

Yhwach: https://tonscan.org/address/UQBHCR5xLb2izCjZNil_0jUhGRon3dHSdQ0v7HCBv95uyqk_#transactions  https://tonscan.org/address/EQBHCR5xLb2izCjZNil_0jUhGRon3dHSdQ0v7HCBv95uyvT6#transactions  how can both of these addresses be the same address?

Yhwach: I've created an address using node.js and it gave me the second one. I tried withdrawing some ton to it and it worked. When I import the mnemonic to another wallet the first address appears. What is the difference?

Yhwach: https://t.me/tonkeeper_news/49  found it. But the node.js client generated EQ wallet. How can I generate UQ addresses?

&rey: address.toString({bounceable: false}) (reply to 41520)

&rey: Only offchain flags (testnet indication, bounceable or not) are different in those addresses. (reply to 41518)

Yhwach: Thanks! It works.  One other thing that I did not understand is how wallets work. This wallet seems to be inactive. How can I activate it and send TON to other addresses? Is there any costs for activating the account? (reply to 41522)

&rey: If that's not implemented by existing DEX platforms, we can only hope that you find out what to listen on; likely that will be contract deployment with specific code. (reply to 41515)

&rey: Though, anyone can create their own DEX and you'll have a hard time determining if a contract is one.

SWITCHER | DEV: I only want to listen on stonfi

Dario: Depends on which dex you are trying to implement. On stonfi, you can check docs.ston.fi and take a look at dex source code, here; https://github.com/ston-fi/dex-core (reply to 41515)

&rey: Generally, any library you encounter will automatically deploy wallet on the first use, so you may just send TON out. (reply to 41523)

Yhwach: I'll try now (reply to 41528)

&rey: There are some non-negligible costs, depending on contract size + after deployment storage fee will increase accordingly.

&rey: Though the deploy cost is commonly < 0.1 TON.

Yhwach: https://tonscan.org/address/UQBHCR5xLb2izCjZNil_0jUhGRon3dHSdQ0v7HCBv95uyqk_#transactions Wonderful, It worked thanks! (reply to 41531)

Yhwach: And last but not least, I'll need to listen for hundreds of wallets at the same time. And sometimes I'll need to send transactions from a few thousand addresses. I can deploy a node. Is there any ways to listen to address txes like tron eventlog? (reply to 41531)

Yhwach: So once an address receives TON, I need to be able to detect that and do things accordingly. I need to listen to multiple addresses at the same time

Yhwach: https://github.com/toncenter/examples/blob/main/deposits.js found it ok

Yhwach: didn't work. How do I listen to blocks? (reply to 41535)

User<6085560929>: bitcoin / ltc / ethereum for tele users

User<6085560929>: my marketplace will be an escrow kinda

User<6085560929>: 2.5% fee to me

Ë£∏Ë£∏: how to avoid this?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Suppose I have opened a store where I sell goods and accept "ton" as the currency. A person made a payment to me and provided the tx hash 89f6f64f58c973b0c7ec33fbe0b72b4d885ac271d67c0c3a5afe7f40aacdb624. After verifying this tx hash, which indeed corresponds to a transaction, I proceeded to give them the goods, considering the transaction complete. However, upon opening my wallet, I discovered that the money did not get credited, but instead, it bounced. At this point, I incurred a loss of both the money and the goods.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Therefore, when the other party made a transfer to me and informed me that their hash was "89f6f64f58c973b0c7ec33fbe0b72b4d885ac271d67c0c3a5afe7f40aacdb624," I should immediately recognize that this transaction has gone through the hashes "ee0286602552164251406cbc590a26f63e817f083c142ad9b2ae0541a171cf64" and "641e2a362ac1a4d17b56dafab03f97efe494d31844c8a09d13cf80daf81c9c92" and ultimately bounced back. At this point, I should not have given the goods to the other party.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: However, now, how can I accomplish these tasks? When the other party sends a transaction, they will have a hash, but I need to understand the complete process behind that hash. I know that through a web browser, it's evident that I can see the results. However, if I want to turn this into an automated process, where a program can recognize this situation, how can I go about identifying it?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Suppose I am a shop owner selling goods. When I receive a transfer, I know that the hash for this transfer is 334e166cb9e825d296f52ed020276a11d6b19b70302f94a1a410adb82f870670. I also know that this transaction is from a specific customer. However, which transaction does it correspond to for the customer? If the customer made two purchases but I only received payment for one, how can I determine which one was successful and which one failed? Furthermore, how can I identify which item to send to the customer?

&rey: If your wallet is initialized, money doesn't bounce. (reply to 41642)

&rey: Normally, you include a comment with UID of purchase generated by your service. (reply to 41646)

&rey: Second option. TON Connect provides you with external message which you can match with item. You can track whether the transactions caused by it succeeded.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Well, you're absolutely right. I can use "comment=UID" to pass messages.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: However, I do feel that you need to add an API interface that allows users to retrieve all the hashes associated with a complete transaction using a single hash. Otherwise, your logic cannot be fully closed, and that is also a problem.

Andrey: https://toncenter.com/api/v3/#/default/get_transaction_trace_api_v3_transactionTrace_get (reply to 41617)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Wow, this interface seems to be exactly what I was expecting. I'll give it a try first and see if I can get the desired results.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I have encountered a new question, which is how to scan the blockchain. For example, in the BTC chain, let's say at block height 100, my balance is 1 BTC. Suppose at block height 101, by using "get transactions of block(101)", I retrieve a transaction where I sent out 0.5 BTC. And let's say at block height 102, I receive 1 BTC. At this point, my BTC balance would be 1.5 BTC. This process is straightforward. However, in TON, how can I perform this process? Does anyone know?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: What I mean is, how can I traverse all transactions from block x to block y in the TON blockchain? I'm not quite sure about the main chain and workchains, and they all have block numbers. Which block number should I use and how should I use it? That's the question.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/masterchain-head  response is the block is  "workchain_id": -1, "shard": "8000000000000000", "seqno": 15976190,  https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/transactions/d01e41904329c18fc3a8496fb132178a079f67bd3fa21b90884aa94f78e93473  response is: "block": "(0,8000000000000000,17275308)",  so why the 15976190 < 17275308

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I requested a transaction, and my boss asked me to calculate the number of confirmations for that transaction. Although I know that in TON, once a message is sent, it is considered confirmed, I still need to determine the time difference between the block where the transaction is located and the current latest block.   Confirmations: nowBlockNum - transBlockNum.   However, when I subtract the block number of the transaction on the main chain from the block number on the workchain, I get a negative value. So, how can I calculate the number of confirmations?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I'm crawling blocks, and when I retrieve block 35354837 of the Masterchain, I want to fetch the other shard chains. However, when I use https://tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/masterchain/35354837/shards, it only returns the last_known_block_id. Why doesn't it provide me with the first_known_block_id and second_known_block_id? As a developer, I apologize for my lack of understanding of the overall structure and knowledge of TON. I'm wondering, it seems apparent that the blocks of the main chain should correspond to more than one shard chain's blocks. So why am I unable to retrieve the other blocks? Or is it actually the case that it corresponds to only one block?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: If a block of the main chain corresponds to multiple blocks of shard chains, why aren't all of them returned? Similarly, if it corresponds to only one block, why is this field called "last_known_block_id"?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I feel like a fool in this group as a developer, starting to integrate with this chain without much understanding. I want to ask, why is this chain so unfriendly to beginners? Do you really think your chain is so popular that everyone knows all the background knowledge? When designing a complex system like this, I believe at least some videos or diagrams should be provided to explain the whole process. Why does it seem like I'm the only one in the group who knows nothing? I feel overwhelmed and humiliated while developing here. It's really distressing. Can't there be a simpler way to help me solve problems?

PLATFORM: CNFT Standard In Crypto World   In today's crypto landscape, many users are acquainted with NFTs and recognize them as an innovative technology. However, it's noteworthy that cNFTs represent the next frontier in digital ownership. The cNFT standard enables the development of NFT collections ranging from 100,000 to 1 million items at the same cost as producing a standard NFT.  What is the cNFT standard and how does it work? TON's asynchronous architecture naturally leads developers to use microservice architectures for their smart contracts. This architecture is also true for the current NFT standard on TON, where each NFT is represented as a separate smart contract.   While this approach helps to reduce the load distribution on smart contracts, it creates challenges for developers: 1. Deploying an NFT collection with 1 million items results in the deployment of 1 million + 1 contracts. 2. Managing the operation of multiple NFTs becomes a significant challenge.  By combining on-chain and off-chain data storage, the cNFT standard creates a new mode called "virtual NFTs". The data of these virtual NFTs, including ownership and metadata, is stored off-chain. While on-chain, a Merkle tree root containing all NFTs in the set is maintained. When the first transfer of a virtual NFT occurs, the NFT will be created on-chain and from that point on, it is indistinguishable from classic NFTs. Currently, the GetGems marketplace supports this standard, and collections for instance, Egg Fight Club, are also made with this standard. This standard helps attract a large number of users and distribute millions of NFTs to projects.  Among the advantages of this standard, the following can be mentioned:  - Creating really huge collections, even up to 1 billion items. - Collection Deploy is offered at a fixed price, regardless of its size. - Collection deployment costs are extremely low, similar to deploying a normal empty collection (almost free). - In this case, claiming virtual NFTs is very affordable, comparable to standard transfer. to a standard transfer.) - Full compatibility with existing NFT standards and mechanics. - Implementation in marketplaces is relatively simple.  Interested people can refer to the Github page of this standard to read more about this standard; Moreover, soon the second part of this article will be more in-depth and More technically, we will discuss how programmers can easily create such collections.  Second part will also be dropped and published soon. Stay tuned.  üíú BOT¬† | üåêWebsite¬† |¬† ‚úàÔ∏èTelegram¬† |¬† üê¶Twitter (forwarded from TonRadar)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: When I use https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/masterchain/16008981/shards, it's clear that I can obtain {"shards":[{"last_known_block_id":"(0,8000000000000000,17308108)"}]}. This tells me the maximum block number of this shard. However, I noticed that there is another shard with the identifier c000000000000000. How can I obtain the latest seqno of this shard?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: how can I get all the shard by the api?

Ë£∏Ë£∏: now I knew the shard is 8000000000000000 and c000000000000000

Ë£∏Ë£∏: is there any other shard?

Denis: shards dynamically split and merge if one can't process all transactions

Ë£∏Ë£∏: Wow, that's so cool!

Ë£∏Ë£∏: this is my code. first I have some wallet address. and then get the balance of them. then do some transfer from one to another random.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: then from the start block num to the current block num. get all the tx and parse them and calculate the balance changes. then get the balance from the chain use api "/v2/accounts/{account_id}" then compare the balance.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: the balance before + or - the CalculateBalanceChanges equals the balance after transfers.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: the unit test is success.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: my code can only loop on the shard 8000000000000000.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: first get balance before. then send tx. then get the change the balance. then use the balance before + or - the changes to get the balance after.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: then check the "balance after" equal the balance on the chain.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: for example. I loop from the (0,8000000000000000,17308362) then (0,8000000000000000,17308363) then (0,8000000000000000,17308364) until the current block num.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: but I don't know how the find the other shard.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: if the transfer is record on the c000000000000000 not on the 8000000000000000

Ë£∏Ë£∏: my code is bug.

Luca | SpyDefi | ‚õîÔ∏è: How mate?

&rey: No need to do that. Just use "Send" button on @wallet main page and enter your TON Space address. (reply to 41824)

Tim: It's not hard, but not super easy (reply to 41820)

Ë£∏Ë£∏: while the demo https://tonapi.io/v2/blockchain/masterchain/123456/blocks shows a lot of shards.

Ë£∏Ë£∏: I have limited knowledge about this chain, and my ability to read English documentation is also weak. As a result, I often encounter many confusions. Thank you all for helping me.

Obviously I'm doing something wrong. If anyone have any idea, on how to achieve this.

Thank you and hope to see some faces from this group there.  RSVP here: https://www.meetup.com/ton-helsinki/events/298029435/

Anderson | Steam Protocol: So, they don't even get the transaction fees or any kind of rewards? Then why would someone run a node outside of the organisation. Does this mean that all the nodes are just ran by TON which makes it non-decentralised? (reply to 42055)

&rey: Validators are decentralized, liteservers from config are questionably so, but there are services (mostly indexers, like tonconsole.com) which also have liteservers and may get payments. (reply to 42058)

&rey: Transaction fees are exactly deterministic and go to validators, probably to the one who included transaction in block. Intermediate nodes have no say in this.

Dmytro: Hello everyone, don‚Äôt judge strictly, I‚Äôm newbie in TON, I came for help and advice from experienced people.  I'm going to write my own indexer in node js. My goal is to receive blocks and shards in real time - find transactions in them associated with my addresses and save these transactions in the database.  I am now stuck on the question of which protocol and data source should I choose for this purpose.  ADNL or toncenter API v2 or v3 or ton-api?  2) Is it correct to say that the main method of communication between TON nodes is ADNL? And if so, then this protocol will be the most suitable for my task since I, having a list of nodes(https://ton.org/global.config.json), will be able to query them directly about blockchain data.  3) Which library is better to use ton-web or ton-org/ton?  4) Also, after indexing the data, I would like to check it using third-party sources (for example, I get all the data from ADNL and then check it on the toncenter) or does this make no sense?

M. Yosefpor: Hi all I had a question regarding TON spaces. as I understand, it is a non-custodial version of the previous ton wallet. But it has an option to have email recovery, and it can be imported on other devices with some numbers sent to email. So how can it be non-custodial with having email recovery?  Are there any documentations explaining how it works under the hood? I can guess it is using that number as a seed to recover the private key, but how is that seed is stored/generated?  Also are there any smart-contracts which associates my TON space with my telegram_id / email?

Maxey: Recently, I noticed that RedStone oracles on TONüíé have introduced a more efficient method for updating prices. I'd like to share a method called Actual Price quoting:  When a quoter offers a price of 1 TON = 20 jUSDT, they actually need to deposit 1 TON and 20 jUSDT into the Oracle. If a verifier believes this quote is undervalued, they can directly purchase the 1 TON with 20 jUSDTü§©.  If the quoter's price isn't arbitraged for a period, it indicates the accuracy of the price‚úÖ. The Oracle can then incorporate this quote, and the quoter is rewardedüí∞.  Unlike other oracle's mechanism, which relies on node-sourced quotes and uses token collateral to ensure quote quality, the Actual Price method encourages quoters to provide accurate prices, or else face the risk of arbitrageüíÄ.

Maxey: Furthermore, due to TON's high TPS‚ö°Ô∏è, the waiting time for quoters to get verified is relatively faster compared to other chains. Assuming the verification time is 10 blocks, it would take 120 seconds on Ethereum, but only 50 seconds or even less on TON.   This approach is highly compatible with TON's characteristics, making it very suitable for implementation on TONüíé.

Max | TonMap: Hello everyone,  I have a task. It's a store with a lot of products, let's say 10 million products, which means 10 million IDs.   - A user can make a payment and receive a product, and the smart contract will record the user as the owner of a specific product by its ID.  - The user can then verify on the blockchain that they indeed own the product with that ID. In the contract, there will be a pair of wallet and ID stored.  How can this be implemented? Does the contract have a limitation of 32,000 elements in its storage?  Thank you.

Daniil: to sell these products and represent their owner on-chain, you can simply use SBTs (soul-bound nfts) or implement a custom contract for your needs. after that you can easily verify ownership both on-chain (with merkle proofs) and off-chain (simply by fetching item's owner from contract). (reply to 42620)

Shashank: I have written an article titled 'Why TON Will Lead the Charge in Web3 Mass Adoption.' I would appreciate your feedback and would be grateful if you could share it. Thank you.

Daniil: actually, merkle proofs aren't even required. since SBTs (and possibly your custom contract) don't allow owner change, you can just implement a ownership request operation that will send a response with owner address of a given item.  but merkle proofs would allow to do that in a single transaction, which is faster. (reply to 42621)

Max | TonMap: Oh. Good. So. I can use the soul-bound nfts and creating for 10 millions these tokens? Has TON github  example of it? Thanks (reply to 42621)

Daniil: just create an SBT collection and mint items to those who purchase your products.  or if you want to do all that onchain (and if that fits your project needs), you can write a simple smart contract that will accept payments from users and mint SBTs to them. (reply to 42624)

But it made my code longer. After refactoring to global variables, I have saved a lot of lines, I think I had about 30% less lines of code, and gas usage was still good. (reply to 42644)

BTC25: TonMiner (reply to 42632)

Behrang: In summary:  coins is an alias for VarUInteger 16, which means it will take a variable bit length depending on the number of bits of the integer.  Since it's VarUInteger 16, it will use 4 bits to store the length of the integer in bytes. So, it can store a number between 0 to 15 in those initial 4 bits.  If your number is zero, only 4 bits of 0 is stored.  If your number is greater, depending on the required bytes, it will store the number of bytes (at most 15) and then store those number of bytes.  Max number is 15 bytes, which is 15 * 8 = 120 bits.  So you can serialize an unsigned integer up to 120 bits in a coins, and you will use at most 124 bits.  Some example numbers and their bit representations:  0 => 0000 1 => 0001 00000001 259 => 0010 00000001 00000011 (reply to 42648)

TON Answers Bot (not AI): a transaction succeeded but to another wallet from pol  Hi all, have a question. I have a new Tonkeeper address, and I've sent to it 25 ton. Nothing arrived, so i checked it out on tonscan.org, and well, when i insert my address, it shows another address and tons are there. I don't really understand what happened, and in the section "contracts" it says: "Uninitialized address This address doesn't contain any data in blockchain ‚Äî it was either never used or the contract was deleted. Now it just aimlessly floats in the digital void."  does this mean that i've lost my token actually?  i've other tonkeeper wallets on other phones and was always fine!üòµ‚Äçüí´  üîó Answer on TON Overflow

Howard: I think using global variable is that you don't need to type-in the parameters all the time right? Even tho your function just changed 1 storage parameter, you still can use unpack() + save_data() to quickly safe the data. (reply to 42651)

Behrang: The reason for using global variables in my code is to remove many lines of code and improve readability.   Here is the commit that I've changed code from using local variables to use global variables:  https://github.com/HipoFinance/contract/commit/a69ab3f2276e61c075da59b4231271af525d6840  In the old version, in every function I had 10 to 20 lines of code just for loading data, and a few more lines to save data.  After the change, there are only two to four lines of code. The logic of each function is easily visible and readable.  The gas cost was not very different from the previous version, so it was worth it. (reply to 42698)

However, if a value other than 0 is used in initDataCell, the deployment is successful.     ;; code #pragma version >=0.2.0;  #include "../imports/stdlib.fc";  (int, int, int) load_data() inline {     slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();     int var1 = ds~load_uint(8);     int var2 = ds~load_uint(256);     int var3 = ds~load_uint(256);      return (         var1,         var2,         var3     ); }  () save_data(     int var1,     int var2,     int var3 ) impure inline {     set_data(         begin_cell()             .store_uint(var1, 8)             .store_uint(var2, 256)             .store_uint(var3, 256)         .end_cell()     ); }  () recv_internal(int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {     if (in_msg_body.slice_empty?()) { ;; ignore empty messages         return ();     }     slice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();     int flags = cs~load_uint(4);      if (flags & 1) { ;; ignore all bounced messages         return ();     }     slice sender_address = cs~load_msg_addr();      int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);     int query_id = in_msg_body~load_uint(64);      throw(0xffff); }  (int) version() method_id {     return (1234); }    // Failed initDataCell in deploy ts script beginCell()       .storeUint(0, 8)       .storeUint(0, 256)       .storeUint(0, 256)  .endCell()  // Successful initDataCell in deploy ts script beginCell()       .storeUint(1, 8)       .storeUint(2, 256)       .storeUint(3, 256)  .endCell()    It seems not to be a Cell data bit length limit issue, but could you provide insights into the cause of this problem?

Snowkid DM BAD NO: Hey I have not quite Dev but important questions, I‚Äôm new to TON but I like it.   Questions: How can you tell if a jetton contract has had admin revoked How can you tell if more jettons can or cannot be minted How can you tell where the JSON data for the jetton is stored? (or is that for the image only) Is there an API i can call for these types of things Is TON compatible with ethers.js? Can you tell if a Jetton has been minted with custom codes as opposed to TonMinter?  Thanks, I appreciate the help.

dwusiq: hell,I tried to send the message Tonweb, but got an error message: "BitString overflow",and the payload is : "data:application/json,{\"op\":\"transfer\",\"p\":\"ttt\",\"tick\":\"mm\",\"vin\":[{\"txid\":\"AW7u95LbUHmP387+5/s5OJbzwtJJHEXuI31bd09UHq8=\",\"vout\":\"0\"}],\"vout\":[{\"amt\":\"1\",\"scriptPubKey\":{\"addr\":\"UQCZe-t4-Sr7IXrcDwfbSn6nE-rQT0kaQcd8zYWichdDdbz_\"}}]}",

Andy: Hello I try to build Jetton that I own but I can‚Äôt to do deal with change   mnemonics, do you have and tip dealing it ?

Zero: can I get data of some token pre-lp?

Bryan Dong | TAPP: Hey guys, my team recently build a sniper bot on telegram for tokens on TON! would appreciate if anyone wants to try it and give us some feedback! ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.me/morfeysniperbot

Daniil: is it Tact contract? (reply to 42811)

Andrew: you call jetton_master with a text comment?  Is it should be a mint or some request with binary body? (reply to 42811)

&rey: Send multiple (up to 4). Wherever list of messages is accepted. (reply to 42810)

Seitaro: can you provide link to transaction? (reply to 42818)

&rey: Do you also provide opcode and query ID during deployment? Do you have links to two contracts to compare? (reply to 42798)

Howard: aany example for this

Ihor: Hello! I'm trying to get staking info by address from the self-hosted TON node. Found tonapi.io which provides such endpoint: "/api/v2/staking/nominator/<address>/pools". Is there any other way of getting such kind of data using RPC calls? Thanks in advance!

Falco: What data are you looking for exactly? (reply to 42828)

Ihor: To get info about current staking balances for given address (reply to 42830)

Falco: You want to get info from the nominator address or from the validators end? (reply to 42831)

Ihor: For the nominator (reply to 42832)

Falco: Maybe you can use liteclient if you are running your own node

Falco: But using the API is easiest :D

Van√´k: domains like: EQC9CSGYHvFMMYwrRr6WUlAPe7Z_i28yY4-gABT2jSRD_-2V EQC6LmRZ_RnOZ3zNKTfsPBk1Z91ZLUWSKRxRNC9R_Aejoni_ (reply to 42753)

Ihor: I see, so TON node has functionality to return staking nominator data through ADNL, is that correct? (reply to 42834)

Ihor: maybe you know any additional sources or docs related to this topic

Falco: I think you can use get_pool_data to get info about the pool and nominators for the pool

Falco: There is also list_nominators I believe

Ihor: Thank you for quick response! (reply to 42839)

Daniil: What do you mean by that? (reply to 42814)

Daniil: In which language was your Jetton minter written?

Daniil: Then look in its sources and see what throws such error code. (reply to 42847)

Daniil: Try CTRL+F in the sources of the smart contract. (reply to 42849)

/ Stars Bank: Can I use tonweb for this? (reply to 42820)

&rey: How do you make one transaction? Actually, you can (by rewriting https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet#sending-multiple-messages-simultaneously), but @ton/ton has better wrappers that allow to send multiple messages simultaneously. (reply to 42851)

&rey: Maybe, there is something like throw_unless("error-name"c, ...);? (reply to 42852)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: thanks btw

Snowkid DM BAD NO: is ADNL intended to be used as an abstraction layer on top of TCP or instead of TCP

Snowkid DM BAD NO: Is it possible to change the rpc to another rpc, like in metamask? in the browser extensions for tonkeeper or myTonWallet

&rey: There are both ADNL/TCP (for connecting to liteservers) and ADNL/UDP (inside overlay network). (reply to 42913)

&rey: For browser Tonkeeper, you cannot since there are no alternatives to used indexer (tonapi). For MyTonWallet, you cannot likely because that was not implemented. (reply to 42915)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: yeah I had some issues accessing tonkeeper (browser and desktop) the other day because of a backend issue - I traced the request and it was a cloudflare error / server crash.   In eth/MM - i would just change the rpc if I had an issue like this.

&rey: unless application used fancy RPC that can emulate messages and list user's jettons. (reply to 42918)

Kenny$$Shillz: Hello everyone. Hope U all having a good day .. please I need some direction. I'm trying to monitor for new token deployments on the ton Blockchain. Currently I'm using the 'subscribe_block' method I found at https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/streaming-api to get the file_hash and root_hash for the blocks. Can some one point to where I can find information to answer the following questions I have: 1.How are new token contracts represented in a block? 2.What information can be used to identify a new token deployment (e.g., contract creation event)? 3. What information can be used to identify a new token deployment (e.g., contract creation event)?

Vladimir: Simple question ... rldp-http-proxy & testnet-global.config.json ... can somebody point me out to the working testnet config ? or how should I reconfigure it ?  tried a ton of options/configs but getting hit by RLDP connection timeout ... ubuntu 22.04 LTS latest ... latest testnet -global.config.json (https://ton-blockchain.github.io/testnet-global.config.json), tried build from source and also from binary releases but no luck. NAT is correctly configured (verified by tcpdump & FW logs) ... ADNL is generated and moved under keyring folder  EDIT: tried with mainnet/global conf ... and that seems to be working ... so the question is WTF is testnet configuration for when its not working for its purpose

&rey: In an account-chain, lt is guaranteed to increase. When shardchain imports messages, that is done in order of lt increasing as well. That creates guarantee that if there are two messages A‚Äî>B, their order is preserved. (reply to 43052)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: is that number format like blocks plus minutes?

Snowkid DM BAD NO: for instance 44100633000015   block 44100633  item inside the block 000015

&rey: Lt has no meaning beside inducing order. Even if block number can be found there, format is eligible to change without notice. (reply to 43057)

Howard: function timestampToDateString(timestamp: number) {     let date = new Date(timestamp * 1000);     let dateString = date.toLocaleTimeString();     return dateString; } (reply to 43052)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: so do we as devs generally care about block height or are we simply concerned about logical time?

Snowkid DM BAD NO: logical time just seems like a nonce to me

&rey: for flow_item in response['value_flow']:   if not flow_item['account']['is_wallet']: continue   if 'jettons' not in flow_item: continue   if len(flow_item['jettons']) > 1:     print('User worked with more than 1 jetton')     continue   ton_neg = flow_item['ton'] < 0   jetton_neg = flow_item['jettons'][0]['quantity'] < 0   if ton_neg and not jetton_neg:     print('Bought jettons', flow_item['jettons'][0]['symbol'])   elif not ton_neg and jetton_neg:     print('Sold jettons', flow_item['jettons'][0]['symbol']) (reply to 43055)

&rey: Yes, it's generally that. (reply to 43062)

&rey: Devs usually care about neither. Lt is useful for finding transactions, but the same can be done with its hash only.

&rey: If you want to enumerate all transactions on one account, you would use lt. If you want to listen to transactions at large, that requires block height (or, more precisely, last masterchain block + parent references).

Snowkid DM BAD NO: I‚Äôm still seeking to understand how blocks are printed. For instance my friend thinks it is similar to solana where the next block is mined before the previous block is finalized

Snowkid DM BAD NO: but also this asynchronous architure throws me off

&rey: Blocks are definitely final before next one is started. Otherwise, how would validator know what message must be processed first? (reply to 43067)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: and im trying to grasp this.   My guess, which is far from educated, is somehow a string of transactions (that would be a single contract call on ETH) is somehow encapsulated so that they execute in order and if one fails they all fail.   Add sharding, im kind of lost but my guess there would be that the string of async transactions would be embedded into a shard to be added

&rey: Have you seen this yet? https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain (reply to 43070)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: in solana they vote on which transactions get mined into block a. each transaction has dependencies and that must be respected before block b gets mined. anything breaks on block b and block a cant be finalized (reply to 43069)

Tawfik: thank you :) (reply to 43063)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: this one seemed to help a bit  https://ton.org/comparison_of_blockchains.pdf

Mohammad: UIUX design is ready (reply to 43074)

&rey: Blocks are quite limited in size, meaning they can be collated, distributed and validated fast.

Snowkid DM BAD NO: I‚Äôve only seen tonscan - where would you see transactions by block? (reply to 43079)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: besides polling a validator etc

Snowkid DM BAD NO: 44100633000015 44100633000001 44100599000015 44100599000001 44100555000003  given the LT‚Äôs above, this appears to be three separate groups of transactions. but maybe they are asynchronous calls from each other.   how would you even know they are linked or dependent on each other?

Snowkid DM BAD NO: thanks for helping me out by the way

Snowkid DM BAD NO: I‚Äôm thinking in terms of  tx1 checks a balance and sends a fee tx2 somehow receives the fee and returns a status tx3 sends jettons to wallet that initiated tx 1  But again I‚Äôm just guessing at how these asynchronous contracts work

&rey: https://tonscan.org/block/0:8000000000000000:41634281 (reply to 43080)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: thanks (reply to 43086)

&rey: One transaction specifies that its in_msg is a message produced by another one (listed in out_msgs). (reply to 43082)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: so thats basically a dependency

Snowkid DM BAD NO: does that cause the requirement that all messages must be resolved in the same block?

&rey: All unprocessed messages go into queue. (reply to 43090)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: what if I broadcasted an infinite chain of transactions that had inputs and outputs tied to each other (reply to 43091)

&rey: You'd spend much TON making validators happy for that. (reply to 43096)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: or at least to the point where the block size max would be exceeded

Snowkid DM BAD NO: they would get mined with open unresolved messages?

&rey: Blocks will be created with some messages in queue, yes. You may find examples a few weeks ago, when inscriptions were first introduced.

Snowkid DM BAD NO: Ok so this infers that asynchronous transactions which fail cant be rolled back

Snowkid DM BAD NO: maybe im wrong with my impression of what an async tx is

&rey: There is some message, addressed to a smart contract. Once all previous messages in queue have been processed, that message initiates a transaction. Transaction launches contract and determines its response to incoming message: what it sends out and how it changes its persistent storage. Outgoing actions are validated, balance is updated, and outgoing messages are added into queue to be processed later. (reply to 43102)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: that helps. but what if it reverts

Snowkid DM BAD NO: does it have to send a message back to the first contract telling it that it was reverted?

Snowkid DM BAD NO: @pcrafter thanks for the lesson. I will chew on this stuff and come back when I‚Äôm ready for more. Most appreciated

&rey: Yes, that's called bouncing. Sender may set that it's not interested in bounces, though. Offchain, that's represented by having destination address converted to unbounceable format (UQ...) (reply to 43105)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: Bonus question  So I guess there has to be a gas transaction that is passed around to all the message receivers in the chain. Appears to be passed via the forward fee field in the message. How do you calculate the gas required for the enitre tx when it spans multiple messages?

Adapt: Hi there, full node (MyTonCtrl) started to display this error when asked for status:  Failed to retrieve unit state: No buffer space available Failed to retrieve unit state: No buffer space available Error: unsupported type for timedelta seconds component: NoneType  Cannot find any info about it. Any ideas?

&rey: Transaction in TON, üéâ :tada:, by definition spans one message ‚Äî one that initiated it. How gas is calculated? Sender passes some TON, they're spent for computation and usually whatever remains is forwarded to the next message (contract may instead send a fixed amount, or its entire balance, or something like that; that's based on SendMode). (reply to 43111)

Snowkid DM BAD NO: ok yeah i saw some refund transactions so i guess thats the roundabout way to deal with it too

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I want to link wallet to a user in our app.  I solved it by ton proof and telegram init data hash verification. I implemented a miniapp backend with python which can extract telegram init data from custom header that send from my react frontend.  Then, after checking the header is valid, I get telegram user id from the init data string. Furthermore, I use pytonconnect to generate a ton proof payload, which will be signed later by wallet.   Last but not least, I return the redirect url which is generated from pytonconnect. Sending it directly to the frontend and ask user for clicking that link.   After clicking the link, wallet app will open with ton proof signing prompt. If user clicks confirm then the backend will receive the singed message. Then I can check the validity of this payload and update the relation of user and received wallet addresses. (reply to 43138)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: We proudly refer to ourselves as the first pure decentralized oracle because our protocol is capable of obtaining the latest asset values with minimal error. The term 'pure' in this context means that there's no need for running an additional decentralized network for quoting or pricing, nor is there a requirement for liquidity pools to obtain a lagged price weighted average.  Regarding our documentation, we are currently in the process of creating more visually appealing document images to facilitate intuitive understanding. The style is likely to be similar to our brief explanatory videos. We plan to release this alongside our mini app and appreciate your patience in the meantime.  At present, we are learning how to effectively manage our community and have plans in place. Our hope is to soon gather a group of professional developers like yourself to help us identify potential vulnerabilities in our protocol, allowing us and the TON blockchain to grow together.

User<5742274103>: Hi guys

User<5742274103>: So we are preparing to do an ICO for a project we are working on and want to do it with the Ton network. What type of Jetton token is it? My understanding is that we have to use something like: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-minter-ICO.fc. The reason I'm asking this is because I'm trying to figure out how to build an ICO page and send tokens to users tonkeeper wallets, etc. Any reasons or ideas'as to how we could do this would be much appreciated includng into adding it into our tech etc.  I asusme Jetton token are not ER20 correct?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: You can‚Äôt be sure how explorers (and exchanges, as we talk about Jetton) parse return value.

&rey: Please note that on Ethereum, for instance, anyone could still find out your public key so it offers no additional security.

&rey: Also, until your wallet is initialized its address is hash of (public key + some data) so there's one additional level resisting private key search.

wikig: Hello guys ! I got a silly question here :  What i trying to do is:  1.randomly new a account {acc} 2.user A transfer TON into {acc} 3.user A send the privateKey to user B 4.user B withdraws the TON to it's own account . (Using tonconnect , and sign transaction by Telegram-wallet-bot)  But i meet a troble in step {2} . When i try to send some TON into the address i just created(before deploy into chain) , It failed .  The transaction had successfuly send out , but got auto refund for some reason i don't know .  Then i try directly send TON into the new address by Telegram-wallet-bot , still refund .   Here are the results : https://tonviewer.com/EQCESAKwFXU4j-8q5Z7oRsBh-wuT6orbgF-Or2DtGhta4Tro

wikig: I don't know why it happened , so i use wallet.ton.org to send some TON into the new address , and it work .   During the first 3 failed transaction ,the {Status} of the new address always {nonexsit} . Which means that it should be able to recive TON from other address .   So now i guess , it might be the issues of the {wallet Interfaces} of sending wallet . All the 3 transactions that auto refund are sending from a wallet with {wallet_v4r2} . But the sucess one are using  ${wallet_v3r2} .   I don't really know what the core issue is , and how to slove the issue like it .(How can i transfer TON into a randomly new wallet by Telegram-wallet-bot )  Any ideas ? Thanks ! (reply to 43441)

Andrey: https://github.com/ton-community/vanity-contract (reply to 43487)

Daniil: It‚Äôs practically impossible (reply to 43487)

Nxrix: How should I get a list of a wallet nft and jettons using toncenter api or jsonrpc?

Nxrix: Is it even possible?

&rey: No, you need an indexer for that. (reply to 43495)

&rey: Considering NFT/jetton transfer may not even include any transactions at destination wallet.

Nxrix: Any free api service to do that? (reply to 43496)

&rey: dton.io/graphql, IIRC. (reply to 43498)

&rey: + 2^256 more if you want to find secret key as well, giving total complexity of 2^257. (reply to 43491)

&rey: $500-1000/week would be a fine estimate for auditor (~= tester + responsibility). (reply to 43484)

Barbell: hi all

Nxrix: Mostly no (reply to 43520)

Barbell: is dev testnet down?

Anastasiia: When @ton/ton package is used to send a transaction it doesn't return transaction hash or any other data for transaction tracking and the recommended way to search the transaction hash is something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73817581/how-can-i-wait-for-transaction-to-confirm-using-tonweb.   It's quite unusual compare to packages for other blockchain and honestly creates some bad dev exp.   So I am just curious how TON transaction hash is calculated? Are there any data that can't be precalculated or something?

Danya: Hi guys!  Is it possible to change the colour of the back button?

Nastya: Same problem, what was the answer you found? (reply to 38444)

Nastya: Different wallets (TonKeeper, MyTonWallet, etc) send different serialized StateInit for the same V4R2 wallet contract while working with TON Connect pipeline  How is that even possible?

Nastya: https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/addresses  AccountID is a hash of StateInit and it is immutable  User-friendly "wallet address" is just a representation/serialization form of AccountID + WorkchainID + some flags included (bounceable/non-bounceable, etc)  So, it's okay that "addresses" are different, but they all based on the same base AccountID  Is that correct?

Nastya: The question is, how can there be different StateInit(s) for the same wallet contract? (reply to 43624)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: StateInit includes public key which is generated from seed phrase (reply to 43626)

&rey: Cache bits, CRC32, cells index. (reply to 43624)

Nastya: That's right, sure  But for one seed phrase there must be one public key, isn't it?   So, shouldn't different wallet apps generate the same StateInit if they have been initialized using the same seed phrase? (reply to 43637)

Nastya: How to build a StateInit cell doc: https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/cookbook#how-to-build-a-stateinit-cell

Nastya: It looks like there is no any CRC32 checksum or cache bits in StateInit spec :(  Can you tell more details, what do you mean? (reply to 43638)

Nastya: * We are talking about only one instance of V4R2 wallet contract, of course (reply to 43639)

Kenny$$Shillz: Yes (reply to 43639)

Nastya: That's why it is interesting, how can wallet applications send different base64 strings of StateInit when working via TON Connect pipeline (for the very same V4R2 wallet)  It's quite strange :0

–ö–ª–µ—Ü–∫–∞: hi! is there any standart way of sending simple transfers? I'm using Blueprint. Building transfer message like that: beginCell()     .storeUint(0x18, 6) // nobounce     .storeAddress( address )     .storeCoins( amount )     .storeUint( 0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 )  .endCell() Then, adding seqno and mode: const msg = beginCell()                         .storeUint( await this.getSeqNo( provider ), 32)                         .storeUint( mode, 8 )                         .storeRef( message )                     .endCell(); And signing it: let signature: Buffer = sign( message.endCell().hash(), this.secretKey );         return beginCell()             .storeBuffer( signature )             .storeBuilder( message )         .endCell(); But, when i'm sending this message from contract - nothing happens. I'm checking balance of contract i'm sending coins to, but it isn't changing.
