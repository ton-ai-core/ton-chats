Crypto: How?? (reply to 69290)

&rey: This is but one of the ways to set up development environment. Instructions are on https://docs.ton.org. (reply to 69289)

Crypto: Thank you,  But I have one question. If I wanna develop the FunC smart contract, do I have to install FunC on my local? (reply to 69294)

&rey: You don't have; you can use blueprint instead, which has FunC compiler executable in WebAssembly form inside. (reply to 69295)

Crypto: But if I have to use fift, then how?

&rey: Fift or TVM assembly? The difference is important here. (reply to 69297)

In buffer case it pareses correctly in case size of data isnt huge but stringTail case it parse incorrectly. So what can cause this ,any hints or 'predictions' ?

Actually, I want to search inside the transactions of a Toncoin blockchain address, what is the best and easiest way?  In normal mode, we go to tonviewer and we search and find it. What should we do when there are so many transactions that we cannot find them manually and for example we are looking for a specific amount or a specific comment? There is no ready code for this?

&rey: Use dton.io/graphql. (reply to 69518)

Emil: Hi everyone, I am currently working with TON and I need to make transactions idempotent. This means that if I send the transaction multiple times, it should only be applied once. I am aware that on the EVM chain, this can be achieved by specifying a nonce. Could anybody please advise on the alternative method to achieve idempotency on the TON blockchain?

&rey: mnemonics = mnemonic_new() public_key, private_key = mnemonic_to_private_key(mnemonics) code = WALLET_V4_R2_CODE data = WalletV4Data(seqno=0, wallet_id=698983191, public_key=public_key).serialize() state_init = StateInit(code=code, data=data).serialize() address = Address((0, state_init.hash)) (reply to 69606)

&rey: You can mine appropriate init cell (data, mainly) so that its hash, encoded appropriately, creates the suffix. (reply to 69609)

mohsen: oh It was a little difficult (reply to 69612)

Mikey: Can you give example (reply to 69612)

&rey: I assume you mean transactions on the wallet? Specify seqno (feature of wallet contracts); message with invalid seqno will not be sent, thus one message won't get sent twice. (reply to 69610)

mohsen: seqno=0, wallet_id=698983191 What is the reason for these numbers? (reply to 69618)

mohsen: This piece of code you gave helped me. thank you. Is wallet_id an arbitrary expression? (reply to 69611)

&rey: Wallet applications define it. If you don't desire your wallet to be importable normally, you may use arbitrary 32-bit number. In particular, wallet_id must be different between testnet and mainnet, however no app ensures that. (reply to 69628)

User<5435924052>: here's experienced skilled ton developer with extensive experiences of FunC/Tact . if you are in need of developer , reach me out . thanks

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: We have found a wierd bug in FunC, and submit a issue to github  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/issues/1022  ///////////  When we call the is_claimed function with the index parameter set to 0, the claim_bit_index is calculated as 0 % 256, which results in claim_bit_index = 0. Consequently, int mask = 1 << 0, meaning mask = 1.  As we start using the mask variable for some comparisons, we notice an interesting situation. The mask currently equals 1, but when we compare it with mask == 1, the result dumped is 0, which is not what we expected. It should be -1, because mask = 1 and 1 == 1. Then, when we compare mask != 1, the dumped result turns out to be -1, which is also contrary to common logic.

Tri·ªáu H·ªìng: Hello, let me ask how to call ton contracts in the front end in the simplest way, everyone

Tri·ªáu H·ªìng: And which library do you usually use to connect?

Harry: everyone, how to check platform with TON? i saw one, but now i can't find it in which library

Illia: This is a JavaScript library for TON (https://github.com/ton-core/ton)  However, you're probably looking for TON Connect (https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/overview)  This is a nice guide on how to integrate TON Connect with React, but there are also guides for vanilla JS and telegram bots. (reply to 69782)

Illia: Can you clarify what you mean by 'to check platform with TON'? (reply to 69788)

Tri·ªáu H·ªìng: I want to make a web3, how can I call contracts from the blockchain in the frontend :< (reply to 69791)

Harry: i saw one of my ton library can do something like library.platform.window/library.platform.android/...  but now i dont remember which ones can do that.. i try to detect which platform user using (reply to 69793)

Illia: I started my web3 journey on NEAR Protocol, and, to be honest, it wasn't easy. Therefore, I completely understand you.  This is how to send a transaction: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/react#sending-transactions  However, this shows how to send just Toncoins. If you want to go beyond that and interact with smart contracts, then you need to get someone to provide you with wrappers for these contracts or you have to write wrappers yourself.  To write wrappers yourself, you need to know how the blockchain works so reading docs is a must-have. You have to open the docs read though and do your best to understand. If you don't understand, then ask a question here.  This is a hard way, but the only way.  You may try learning Solidity to see how Ethereum works. I improved my knowledge by learning Solidity after contracts written in Rust for NEAR Protocol. (reply to 69795)

Haris: anybody? (reply to 69894)

Wayne: The error you're encountering indicates a "Duplicate error id: Access denied" during the Tact compilation process. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:  1. Check for Duplicate Error IDs: The error message suggests there is a duplicate error ID in your code. Go through your Tact code and ensure that each error is uniquely identified. Duplicate IDs can cause conflicts during compilation.  2. Review Error Handling: Verify your error handling code. Ensure that each error message and ID is distinct and correctly implemented.  3. Update Dependencies: Sometimes, errors can be caused by outdated dependencies. Ensure all your npm packages are up to date by running:      npm update     4. Clean and Rebuild: Clean your project to remove any cached or residual files that might be causing issues:      npm run clean    npm run build     5. Check Compiler Configuration: Ensure that your Tact compiler configuration is correct and there are no conflicting settings.  6. Consult Documentation and Community: Refer to the Tact language documentation for any known issues or updates related to error handling. Additionally, reaching out to the Tact community (e.g., forums, GitHub issues) might provide more specific guidance and solutions.  If these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide a snippet of your Tact code, specifically the parts where errors are defined and handled, so I can give more targeted advice. (reply to 69898)

Wayne: Response from GPT ) (reply to 69899)

Haris: yeah i have already checked it with gpt but it did not help

Dmytro: It's better to use FunC rather than Tact. FunC is an older language with no compiler issues. (reply to 69894)

dddanivs: 128 seems a lot

Egene: I also found it to be a bit excessive, but for someone willing to lock 340K TON should not be a problem cost wise (reply to 70047)

Egene: If you aren't planning on becoming a validator, and only plan running it in LiteServer mode I think you could try it out with less RAM and see how it goes

dddanivs: I just want to run a node that stays in sync with the Network and send and receive from It, i dont want to be a validator and just run a full node

Egene: you aren't under any financial risk of losing your staked TON if running in LiteServer mode

dddanivs: However i still want to have full history of the blockchain

Egene: Do you already have hardware? If yes, just try with what you have, worst case scenario it will just not be able to process transactions fast enough. just make sure that you have enough SWAP to cover for the missing RAM I am practically certain that you will be able to keep up with the real blockchain transactions, you might just get out of sync during peek times when a lot of transactions are happening at the same time and your slower node is not able to process them as fast as full nodes (reply to 70054)

Egene: We are planning on deploying a couple nodes in the very near future. Hardware is not really a problem for us the requirements seem very reasonable and are lower than most servers we generally deploy for clients  Our main worry is the fact that no ISP can give us a reasonable SLA that would not have us losing a lot of TON during a network outage. In theory you are penalized 101 TON for not participating in block creation and transaction signing for a significant amount of time during a validation round.  We can't find any info online on what a "significant amount of time" is. We just assumed the worst case scenario of being fined 101 TON per every block creation that happens every 5 seconds. We can achieve a reasonable SLA on our end that any TON fines that occur are covered for by the rewards on a year's timeframe.  However from the ISP's side no one is willing to give an SLA of 99.9999% uptime

Few times it moved forward with following errors:  1. failed to query http over rldp: response deadline exceeded, err: context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) 2. failed to resolve host mydomain[.]ton, err: failed to run dnsresolve method: deadline exceeded, node 135[.]181[.]140[.]221:46995, err: context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)  Some additional info: - TON Site deployed with Tonutils Reverse Proxy on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, firewall disabled; - Domain linked successfully (according to reverse proxy logs); - Server with the site is the VPS server with well-known cloud provider; - Already tried switching connection and devices on the client side ‚Äî issue still there;

&rey: bounce: message can bounce if its processing fails (for instance, if destination contract is uninitialized) and there are not enough TON bounced: this is bounced message, indicating failure ^  These flags are mutually exclusive (bounced cannot be set manually, and upon bounce the former flag is reset automatically). (reply to 70252)

&rey: Attach StateInit in transfer to destination contract. If you mean that wallet is uninit, it should work fine anyway. (reply to 70293)

&rey: You can't add them with TON Connect so you'll have to request user's mnemonic. Generally, this is possible but needs significantly more trust to work. (reply to 70318)

–∫.: Hi, how can we obtain a wallet public key to encrypt a message with it?  1. When the wallet is deployed and not deployed.  2. on-chain and off-chain.  In all of these cases.  Also, consider that we only have a wallet address like:  EQBF35mKBqM_HhNhOND6nMHGgmQ4uv29sZBP20ip2bNNYdkY  This address is random and invalid

&rey: Yes, if you're checking your wallet.  Or you can check destination wallet: then you need to find transaction's outMsgs and check if there is one with bounced:true. (reply to 70350)

&rey: Only onchain when the wallet is deployed (or if you get its StateInit, which is case with TON Connect 2).  You need to call get-method get_public_key. (reply to 70351)

Long: ,"bouneecePhase":{"type":"ok","messageSize":{"cells":"0","bits":"0"}  The tx.description has this bouncePhase, can I use this to check? (reply to 70352)

&rey: Existing wallet implementations return 256-bit slice with Ed25519 public key. Whether it is fit for your application, it's for you to decide.  No, TON Connect 2 doesn't support arbitrary message encryption/decryption. (reply to 70356)

mohsen: transaction = await wallet.transfer(**transfer) Why does the transfer function return only "1"? How do I get more(hash, fee, etc.)? (reply to 70501)

mohsen: Isn't it strange? How can you send a transaction and there is no indication that you can track what happened to that transaction? (reply to 70511)

&rey: I have written a script that sends transaction certainly (sorry, it is proprietary), it has ~120 lines relevant to tracing tx.  You have to listen to messages on the sender's wallet. (reply to 70512)

mohsen: How do I distinguish it from other transactions when I have no indication of the transaction I am sending? Can't I have every indication of the transaction before sending it? (reply to 70513)

&rey: You're sending external message, actually, and a couple of parameters (creation logical and UNIX time) are rewritten before inclusion into blockchain in unpredictable way. (reply to 70515)

&rey: By effects performed. By signature within the message (or full message body, for optimization). (reply to 70515)

mohsen: I know I can use them but the project I'm working on, hash output is a requirement. (reply to 70517)

mohsen: I have implemented this function for more than 20 blockchains and they all return a transaction hash (reply to 70517)

&rey: You have to listen to messages on the sender's wallet, distinguishing them by signature or full external message body. (reply to 70518)

&rey: TON doesn't currently have a guarantee that any external message will be included in blockchain. In particular, most likely it won't get included instantly, instead appearing within 0-30s from sending.

meomeocoj | Mike: I should write the trace for each smart contract if i have a chain of message hook, shouldn't I ? (reply to 70522)

&rey: Do you wish to get the result of transactions chain? If yes, then you do need that.  However, once internal (cross-contract) message is sent, it will get delivered sometime, so you may already activate offchain features/... (reply to 70525)

kevin: there are multiple ways to get that data depends on your circumstance , as I know indexer like tonapi / anton  have that API. if you check network request like tonkeeper / stonfi / dedust, they all have API retrieve jetton balance of any address. and also you can query directly to ADNL with SDK like tonutils-go.

crazycats: Hi all...  New dev here and I am like.... really really new in this whole blockchain too.   I understand I can google my answers, but is there a way/course/program/learning path for beginners to start learning TON?   I do have basic programming skills, but I am no way a master. Feels kinda overwhelmed with lots of new things to learn here and there, and unlike React/python/commonly known programming language and framework, there is no popular course in TON.  And one last thing, is there any PC minimum specification to start developing in TON ? I am kinda stuck financially and can't upgrade my 5 year old laptop. It has windows and 16gb of ram

Tim: I think your questions are a bit vague (reply to 70747)

Abdulaziz: yes i know i had to do a lot thinks, like creating design, interface for playing game, the main thing is safety so that no one abuses bugs what was happened with notcoin (it has also bug with missions). Also i need create smart contract to make feature of nft creating, i need domain on getgems and my hosting or server with domain and etc (reply to 70749)

Abdulaziz: I would like to know how difficult it is, this will be my first big project

Abdulaziz: Maybe i can't know without trying, at least i need a team for fast work, or it can take few months (reply to 70751)

Abdulaziz: I would like to know some information from those who have already created such projects (reply to 70750)

Tim: It will take months with a team. But this chat is more about code questions

Tim: I don‚Äôt know where you can get advice about creating your own project. Try to find other founders and ask them if there any chats like that

Abdulaziz: How did Notcoin make a bug, or was it on purpose? It would be good If I don't repeat their mistake so that my application won't be abused either (reply to 70750)

Nerses: How can i create getter in tact that returns how much storage occupies my contract currently ?

Dmitriy: Hi!  I have a contract which interacs with different jettons (for now it‚Äôs not yet decided whether it should be some specific list of jettons or any of them). This contract receives transfer_notification message from its jetton wallet and then runs some logic. I want to validate that the transfer_notification message came from contract‚Äôs jetton wallet, but not somebody else. Smth like this:   slice jetton_wallet_addr = get_jetton_wallet_address(my_address, jetton_minter_address) ;; maybe some other arguments too throw_unless(228, equal_slices(msg_sender, jetton_wallet_addr))   IOW, I want to have something similar to associated token account program from Solana.  Is it possible to implement this? I see that jetton minter does have get_wallet_address, but it‚Äôs supposed to be called off-chain, and I want to use it on-chain.  Thanks in advance!

User<7123272744>: Often you can see the exit code 0xffff (65535 in decimal form). This usually means that the received opcode is unknown to the contract. When writing contracts, this code is set by the developer himself. (reply to 71214)

C: This is what the documentation says, but I don‚Äôt quite understand it.

C: Is it because I set an unknown opcode that this result occurs? So he wasn't a mistake, was he?

Cake: why? It's need apply? (reply to 71231)

&rey: Well, in @wallet Telegram (or, generally, backend) manages the keypair, not user, so they don't support authenticating users via TON Connect.  Additionally, transactions are sent from central wallet IIRC, which in most cases is not what developer of a dApp intends. So your users should not use @wallet. (reply to 71232)

Edward: Hello,   If I would like to send TON from one wallet to another, programmatically, could anyone point me in the right direction / idea of how to achieve this?   Thanks!

User<7123272744>: You deploy a new smart contract and deposit your TON to it. When you want to send your Ton to another, you send it from the contract to them.  I already have this code. If you want to buy it, let me know asap (reply to 71240)

&rey: Btw, does your script handle both possible modes of failure? (reply to 71241)

musashi: why we need a middle smart contract? the wallet is already a contract =)

&rey: This is the basic script handling 0/2 failure modes. from pytoniq import LiteBalancer, WalletV4R2 import asyncio  mnemonics = []  async def main():      provider = LiteBalancer.from_mainnet_config(1)     await provider.start_up()      wallet = await WalletV4R2.from_mnemonic(provider=provider, mnemonics=mnemonics)      transfer = {         "destination": "UQC25k6lIqOL6Zut4OWKpLNDKmlDdXiRe02IO0yAAZ_ViKQR",    # please remember about bounceable flags         "amount":      int(10**9 * 0.05),              # amount sent, in nanoTON         "body":        "wdwwdwddwdwqwd",       # may contain a cell; see next examples     }      await wallet.transfer(**transfer)     await client.close_all()  asyncio.run(main()) (reply to 71240)

Do I understand correctly that workflow must be something like this:  1) On the frontend user connects his wallet using TonConnect 2) Frontend prepares information about upcoming TON message, sends it do backend 3) Backend somehow signs it using secret key, and sends signed message back to frontend 4) On the frontend I just do sendTransfer of the signed message received from backend  Is it correct? Does anyone know where I can find working example of such workflow?

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Could you clarify, when you say "receive," do you mean "–ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞—Ç—å" or "–æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å"? (reply to 71325)

Dylan: can anyone take a look at this. and help me figure out why it seems to be failing to send the jetton transfers. seems like it maybe has something to do with forward_payload however i havent been able to find anything that points me in the right direction. https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/b1bdcabe98195870feee3f96739c9f96a5d698031f7a45851229532a3df3e77d

Dylan: also curious if anyone knows why its showing up as a StonFi Swap even though its a custom swap contract with opcode being a crc32 of "swap".

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Not enough gas to process the transaction because the forward_fee is zero.  Exit code 709: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter-contract/blob/074b7d5f45f43552146fdf54f972020b2757bc18/contracts/jetton-wallet.fc#L88 (reply to 71379)

Dylan: i saw that. however when i adjusted the gas to be sent as forward_fee i continued to receive errors. its also passing all blueprint testing. any ideas where i might need to look? would it be in the inital external message or the contracts jetton tranfer message

Dylan: hahaha. wasn't expecting any quick fixes more just some confirmation that i was looking in the right area. which you provided. thank you.

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: Check the value set in your smart contract. The message received by the Jetton wallet has a value of 0.039275200 TON. As far as I remember, you need at least 0.05 + forward_ton_amount. (reply to 71386)

Roman: Hi! Can you please elaborate on that. Why storing more 1k may be a problem? Btw I stored 1.5K and it worked... What problems should I expect to happen? (reply to 71410)

&rey: a. Height of tree increases as you store more users, so fees on cell creation increase as well. (They are main portion of the fees, IIRC) b. Each entry in dictionary costs two cells in contract storage. When you reach 65536 cells, contract will simply fail to update because of the storage limit. (reply to 71421)

Roman: So ~30K items in dict will be OK ? (reply to 71422)

Roman: Thanks!  There is another thing that bothering me a bit. I use an address as key in dict. It works.. for now. Address  get from sender address of incoming int message. Address is 267 bit long afaik. I‚Äôm not sure is key size in dictionary limited by size or not. I saw they use hash+workchain (256+8=264bit) as dict key in wallet_v4. I‚Äôm wondering could be there any problems in future (I mean using full address as a key)‚Ä¶ (reply to 71422)

Behrang: It won't be a problem. However, to optimize storage, remove as many bits as possible from the key part. For example, if all addresses are always on basic work chain, then you may be able to store addresses using 256 bits, by storing only the hash part. (reply to 71426)

So, I tried to check if the wallet address is correct but the w.WalletAddress() returns a different value than my actual wallet.  I used the example wallet.V3 to create my wallet from seed, does anyone know how to fix it?

Frances: Is the bot only sauce to get testnet ton?

Gyorgy: On testnet work with less ton 0.1 TON etc.. you can get 5TON/free/hour from the bot.   You usually sending from one wallet to another, you can send back from your second wallet.

Frances: Is the emoji tradable like NFT? (reply to 72020)

Frances: I heard rumors that the founder of telegram would love to nftize  the emojis.

Gyorgy: not yet, but soon

Frances: Ok looking forward to it, it is a good feature, but not on Ton network roadmap as i see.

Frances: They focus more on infra

Gyorgy: roadmap not updated there, couple things already ready, some coming in the next 1-2 weeks. Including final Wallet V5 with gasless transactions (with relays, already available on tonapi).

Illia: Cheeky (reply to 72034)

Gyorgy: Cheeky what? üôÇ (reply to 72036)

Illia: excited about so many new features; including W5; haven't seen that they updated roadmap ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  do you know where to find some docs on extra currencies? what it will look like? (reply to 72037)

Gyorgy: I assume it was USDT and such partnerships.

Gyorgy: What already announced since, I not know much more than anyone here, I‚Äôm not official representative. Just a community member.

Illia: "Sharding Guidelines and Tools" is probably most exciting part, at least for me

Illia: if ton fees decrease a lot it can literally be like AWS but decentralized with smart contracts as services; that's sick

Gyorgy: V5 wallets already can save up 25% fees with some transfers, but already quiet fair priced. Lot of things what seems more expensive now is due smart contracts had fees hardcoded before (ton was $1-2). Since its suggested to use dynamic fee calculations and do not set 0.05 or 0.5 ton fees üôÇ Already you can send a transfer from few cents at the moment, other improvements on the way just good news to hear. Agreed.

_chocolate.py: how can i find claim token contract example

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: I'm not entirely sure, but I think the simplest and quickest way to find an example of a smart contract is to use an internet search engine. For instance, Google or Bing would work perfectly.  https://www.google.com/search?q=ton+jetton+claims+smart+contract+merkle+tree  https://github.com/Gusarich/airdrop (reply to 72092)

User<7123272744>: sure, I am here to help you (reply to 72096)

&rey: As VPN is offchain service, you need an oracle which would confirm or deny that certain amount of traffic was passed (probably just reporting the number). This warrants either a limited subscription plugin on user's wallet or money locker contract that would forward some TON based on service usage; onchain part won't differ at all between different services.

Andy: How accurate is the description of comment behavior in docs  ton org / develop / func / comments ?  The lexer used for the docs as well as the FunC extension for VS Code clearly do not follow said behavior!

&rey: Block ID. IIRC it is triple (root hash, file hash, seqno). (reply to 72164)

Son: Thank you. So I found this is the ton codebase ton/blob/master/tl/generate/scheme/tonlib_api.tl. As I understood, the blockId is the internal value which consists of workchain, shard and seqno but the blockIdExt is the external value that would be equivalent to the blockhash. Is that correct?   ton.blockId workchain:int32 shard:int64 seqno:int32 = internal.BlockId; ton.blockIdExt workchain:int32 shard:int64 seqno:int32 root_hash:bytes file_hash:bytes = ton.BlockIdExt; (reply to 72173)

David: Hi guys, I got error code 9. Under flow  when sending Jetton from smart contract to user wallet, any idea why?

&rey: Offline dump won't be of much use if you don't run a node. (Though you can really use 16/32 GB RAM server, just disconnecting the node from the network so that it doesn't use resources.) (reply to 72189)

D: have any link?

D: I just need offline database of old transactions for a mini research. But i did not find on anywhere (reply to 72198)

yolo: Guys, how can i get my transactions? I'm tried to do in documentations, but my address didn't see PYTHON

Gandalf: Hey guys! Please tell me how to transfer tokens on TON with Java using ton4j, I haven‚Äôt found any clear examples anywhere

Andy: Great explanation.  The LLMs can be impressive at times but GPT-4o, Gemini, DeepSeek Coder-v2 all failed to infer that from the short "Identifiers" section on docs ton org /develop/func/literals_identifiers   This is really a pretty interesting design decision of FunC, it has to have some great advantages for such a radically different design to be chosen.  A lot of people will trip on this like me, I believe. (reply to 72208)

&rey: Please try to find examples in other languages (TON Cookbook has sample script and scheme which may be helpful + TEP-74 explains everything in detail) and port them to ton4j. (reply to 72212)

Stuart: i understand this

&rey: If contract B is uninitialized or fails to process the message (including case when contract is frozen), and message is sent in bounceable mode, then it bounces. To contract A.

Stuart: bounce means it goes back to contract A and doesnt fail

User<7257315147>: Hi

User<7257315147>: Can anyone help? I'd like to know how to create a Tax, Refelection Token on TON

&rey: Please try to explain the idea without keywords. Preferably in terms what messages should be sent, but algorithm of balance changes is also sufficient. (reply to 72283)

Vitor: Reflection tokens have a 'tax' on buy/sell and distributes those to hodlers. (reply to 72285)

&rey: How is "buy" different from "transfer"? (reply to 72287)

Vitor: It isn't, in practice. A more 'safe' implementation (in Ethereum) would be to only 'tax' transfers when a contract is a counterparty (or explicit tax some AMMs). I haven't seen a good implementation of this concept though. (reply to 72289)

Mikko: Much better solution for this problem is to create a AMM pool with high fee % and then direct fee to a treasury (reply to 72291)

Vitor: Agreed. (reply to 72293)

User<7257315147>: So I'm looking to create a Token with 2% tax.   1% tax is used for distributing $TON back to holders who hold a certain amount.   Then the other 1% in $TON for Team wallet and Marketing (reply to 72285)

User<7257315147>: Just an example... not much of a Dev, reason I'm asking is; I'd like to know if this would be possible with a Generated token from Jetton (reply to 72295)

Vitor: 'Jetton' is the standard, akin to 'ERC-20'. I'm not aware of any Jetton implementation with a tax. (reply to 72296)

User<7257315147>: Exactly why i asked, so if I wish to set tax how will i do it then? And can one Make changes to the Contract from Jetton generator? (reply to 72298)

Vitor: You can make changes to a Jetton contract, yes. There's no "standard" contract AFAIK. I would consider hiring a freelance dev to implement that. Or you know, post a bounty.

Syna: you know redo coin. how does redo coin raise budget for marketing? normally it is necessary to get slippage. does he create his budget by selling his tokens? (reply to 72313)

Kryptonite: Hi fellow devs, i am trying to write some custom smart contracts using blueprint sdk, for the flow i want to add jettons as well, so i lookeup to jetton smart contracts, i referred to old smart contracts that are committed to 2yrs ago , and latest stablecoin smart contract committed to official TON github repo.

Kryptonite: i have a doubt , in new stablecoin jetton smart contract , i see uri set for metadata . and in old smart contract there is just a cell reference for content.

Kryptonite: so if offchain uri is set ? will it affect the token metadata or still it will parse without any issue

Kryptonite: which approach would be better: 1. store metadata on chain as refering to old jetton_minter smart contract? 2. Store uri in content cell ? -> in this case will be explorers and wallets get my token metadata correctly ?

User<835351458>: Fees are scarily huge.  If someone buys $100 worth of Telegram stars from Apple or Google Play and pays your TG app in stars...  You will receive only 65% (no vat deduction) or 45% (after vat) of that amount.  Google and Apple take a 30% cut of the stars that people buy from their play stores.  TG takes another 5% cut approx.  And German apps cannot accept stars so they basically have no payment channel on Telegram.  And if you don't comply, your app or bot will be removed from Telegram.  It is a mandatory, not an optional policy.  Bots have been removed already from Telegram for not accepting stars as payment. (reply to 72441)

Fractured: Where did you find a giant thread on this? (reply to 72436)

User<835351458>: Oh I forgot but managed to find it. In the BotTalk group.  This is why Telegram had to implement stars:  Apple's policy: "If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase.Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock contentor functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets, etc." (reply to 72457)

User<835351458>: Telegram has become the de facto enforcer of those guidelines and will remove mini apps and bots from Telegram if they don't comply, even if these apps and bots were never downloaded from Apple or Google app store.  This is to ensure that Telegram itself can still be downloaded from Apple and Google app stores. (reply to 72497)

We're facing a significant decreasing in the speed of TON nodes syncing (nodes simply cannot catch up on any gap, even a day, for about a week) and snapshots downloading speed (now it takes 3 days to download full snapshot against 1 day in past weeks).

Dmitriy: Hi! Is it true that when message processing failed, all the outgoing messages sent within this transactions are reverted?

musashi: no, only that message failed (reply to 72633)

&rey: They just do not get sent. (reply to 72633)

Dmitriy: I see, thanks.  I‚Äôm implementing the processing of transfer_notification message (when my contract‚Äôs jetton wallet got some funds from sender) and want to return the jettons back to sender if the processing failed. What‚Äôs the canonical way to inform the sender that something went wrong? Should I use the forward_payload for it and write the error message there? (reply to 72637)

musashi: the standard jetton contract code already has the onBounce method to handle this I guess (reply to 72639)

Dmitriy: I‚Äôm checking it by writing the following sandbox test scenario:  1. Send the transfer message with malformed forward_payload 2. Assert that sender‚Äôs jetton balance before == sender‚Äôs jetton balance after  But this assertion fails, and the actual sender‚Äôs balance after is less than initial balance exactly at the number of jettons sent, so it seems that it doesn‚Äôt work like this, unless I‚Äôm missing something (reply to 72640)

musashi: oh my bad, the onBounce method to handle the bounced message from internal_transfer not transfer_notification opcode

Dmitriy: Got it, thank you (reply to 72643)

musashi: btw, can you share the code with the forward_payload your implementing?

Dmitriy: Currently it‚Äôs quite a dirty draft, but I can explain what it‚Äôs supposed to do if you want (reply to 72646)

musashi: I think your goal is pretty clear

Stephan: Hi guys, please tell me, what frameworks, languages and technologies do major projects on TON work with?

Daniel: for example: https://tonviewer.com/EQDmkj65Ab_m0aZaW8IpKw4kYqIgITw_HRstYEkVQ6NIYCyW .. not coin premarket doesn't op set_code, does it mean 3k TON not widthdraw?

&rey: You should consider gas; the most common way is to use map.

Nerses: how to parse map if it is part of the message.In case of Int you know that it will be 257 bits and so can parse while in case of map it is problem. Has anyone such problem ?

Nas: Can someone help me understand how does the TON value flow works as shown attached?

&rey: Map? It is Maybe ^Cell, loaded with ~load_dict(). (reply to 72676)

&rey: Generally, if you don't sign any transactions, nothing will happen. (reply to 72686)

Nerses: sorry it seems i described problem not completely. I get message with api and want to parse it and that message type consists of maps.I think ~load_dict() is for FunC,I cant use it in ts (reply to 72689)

&rey: native fun (reply to 72693)

Nerses: so solution for my problem is pares it using FunC language ? (reply to 72698)

&rey: Yes. Or... doesn't Tact support putting multiple maps in a message?

Nerses: It supports.i used Tact to write smart ciontract and message type in that contract has few maps (reply to 72701)

Nerses: 1) is there way to write func code in tact    2) read data in tact from differnet file (reply to 72701)

wikig: Hello guys ~  Some questions here   is there any document or rules about the Telegram star ?   When will my bot or webapp have to use telegram start instead of using crypto currency directly .

Decentralized: anyone knows why this emit(TransferEvent{amount: myAmount, recipient: sender}.toCell());   throws err?

Decentralized: anyone can explain how ton actually handle deployment, is it similar to cosmos where code is upload and then separately instantiate as many times or like ethereum where each contract deployment is independent?  is there a factory model that can handle deployment of many contracts? can someone leave some fund to contract upon deployment instead of separating it to 2 different tx? is there any plan to decrease the gas fee on ton, even without many activities, the gas fee is at least 1000x more than solana or 100x more than aptos/sui...

Ophere: sorry wahe ton wanted to know

Behrang: 1- You will provide init state (that is initial code and data) and if it is not already deployed, will be deployed.   2- what are you trying to achieve?  3- yes  4- no, it's already cheap enough, and contrary to other blockchains, will not get expensive with high load and traffic. If TON price increases a lot, then validators consider decreasing fees, which happend once recently. (reply to 72788)

User<835351458>: In Telegram's Wallet tab, there is Contact Support which connects u to wallet support bot.  In future, use Ton Space (non-custodial) instead of main wallet address (custodial).  Both the custodial and non-custodial wallets can be accessed within your Telegram Wallet. They have 2 different ton addresses.  Or use Tonkeeper, a separate wallet which u access via Wallet Connect. (reply to 72744)

User<835351458>: Most of the clicker games and mini apps on TG are offchain and don't require gas.  Fot example in notcoin, you paid nothing in gas or any other fees to click within app and receive your $400 airdrop. (reply to 72788)

User<835351458>: This is why the TG apps have gone viral.  They are truly free to play as they are offchain.  And then a month later u collect your airdrop.  You can reach 1 billion users on Telegram and they can play and collect their airdrop without knowing anything about crypto or spending any gas fees. (reply to 72812)

Tri·ªáu H·ªìng: Hello everyone, I am new to learning about smart contracts in ton network, can you give me source code examples of contracts like pool, stake or swap?

Tri·ªáu H·ªìng: I have a source example called contract mint and used in react, do you want to check it out? This is the most basic way to call it, because I'm also a newbie. (reply to 72884)

Quillen: I understand that the TON blockchain supports asynchronous internal messages between smart contracts, which means that some messages can fail independently of others. For example, if UserA initiates a transferToken call in my contract, the process flow is as follows: UserA --> WalletA --> MyVaultContractWallet --> MyContract receives Notification from VaultContractWallet.  The question is, what happens if the validation fails in the My Contract? The contract will have already received funds from the user. How should we handle such a case? Should we return the tokens to the users? Are there any similar contracts that handle this scenario, and how do they manage it?

&rey: I assume the rewards are set at backend? If so, you're looking for airdrop-like contract with claim by user. There is one, https://github.com/Gusarich/airdrop. (reply to 72942)

Ash: Is there any code in tact language? It would be really helpful :)

Thomas: is there any solution with dynamic claim data, this airdrop just work with fixed merkle-tree? (reply to 72944)

Thomas: like the model: BE sign to approve claim request, user bring the signature to SC to claim

&rey: You can write it itself. Consider replay protection. Consider what contract should fulfill the claim request: jetton master, jetton wallet or an external contract.  Jetton wallet is actually one of easiest options. BE should sign claim request with user address and total amount of jettons issued to user; jetton wallet then must up-mint required amount of jettons (according to how much user has already claimed) and send custom notification about that to jetton master so that it updates total supply. (reply to 72948)

Nerses: I have created contract which message has different type fields like Int , Address or Map. Is serialization of message deterministic ? I mean that in messages of the same type, fields are stored at the same bit position in each Cell.

Raihan: can i deploy my own smart contracts in ton?

&rey: Yes. Attach its StateInit to a message which would be the first for the contract. Address is deterministically derived from start code and data. (reply to 73079)

Nerses: for eexample if i have such message message Hello {     hi: Int;     hello: Address;     goodDay: map<Int,Int>; } and in serialization field hello ends at bit x will goodDay start at x+1 bit ? Or how they will be stored ?

&rey: For Tact, it is unspecified. You should check TL-B wrappers in files generated during compilation. (reply to 73083)

Development: Hello. I'm looking for a paid job, I'm new to programming, I completed a ton dev study

Nerses: If I am not mistaken you meant this export function loadHello(slice: Slice) {     let sc_0 = slice;     if (sc_0.loadUint(32) !== 2935203360) { throw Error('Invalid prefix'); }     let _hi = sc_0.loadIntBig(257);     let _hello = sc_0.loadAddress();     let _goodDay = Dictionary.load(Dictionary.Keys.BigInt(257), Dictionary.Values.BigInt(257), sc_0);     return { $$type: 'Hello' as const, hi: _hi, hello: _hello, goodDay: _goodDay }; } but from this code it isnt obvious how fields will be stored. (reply to 73087)

Nerses: But it is deterministic,isnt it ? (reply to 73087)

&rey: You can find export function loadHello(...)     ... sc_0.loadUint(32)     ... sc_0.loadIntBig(257)     ... sc_0.loadAddress()     ... Dictionary.load(..., sc_0) Unfortunately, different addresses may have different length in bits, so you can't precalculate specific bit offsets in general. (reply to 73090)

Nerses: so what will be the solution for parsing such message ? (reply to 73093)

&rey: You should load fields in order. Using loadHello function itself is a safe bet, for instance. (reply to 73094)

RISKY: Thanks for the answer, what I am looking for is bot like collab.land but for ton network that can verify a user holds x amount of a jetton and give the user access to a channel or group (reply to 73039)

RISKY: Thinking about building such bot but thought if it already exists, why reinvent the wheel :)

uchebnick: Hello, did I understand correctly that in order to transfer currencies, you need to deploy the wallet contract and then deploy the contract that will interact with the wallet contract?

Nerses: I tried to use loadHello to parse but encountered problem that it accepts argument of type slice while data strign is too long to be stored in slice (reply to 73095)

Dmitriy: Hi!  I‚Äôm trying to follow the contract sharding approach, and implement storing a (key, value) pair in dict in a separate contract to avoid storing unbounded map (it could be really big). Basically I want to calculate this contract address by key and query its storage (by sendig the message to it and processing its reply) in my main contract. Now I‚Äôm trying to figure out how effective it will be in terms of storage costs, so I have a question:  Ideally I‚Äôd like to not allocate some toncoins to this contract balance (i.e. I want to keep it zero or some small amount of toncoins) and want to make message sender to pay storage fee. But the problem is that storage phase is executed first (before credit phase), so it seems that the contract balance should be large enough to cover storage fee before it gets the message. Is it right?

User<835351458>: Via dynamic sharding and parallel processing.   Ton is the fastest blockchain rn verified by independent testing. Pantera made the biggest investment ever in its history by investing $250m in ton.  From ton blog: "The TON Blockchain consists of one masterchain and up to 2^32 workchains. Each workchain is a separate chain with its rules. Each workchain can further split into 2^60 shardchains, or sub-shards, containing a fraction of the workchain's state. Currently, only one workchain is operating on TON - basechain.  Each workchain can split into one quintillion, one hundred fifty-two quadrillion, nine hundred twenty-one trillion, five hundred four billion, six hundred six million, eight hundred forty-six thousand, nine hundred seventy-six shardchains.  This means that TON is not just a single blockchain but a blockchain of blockchains." (reply to 73494)

Allen: Hello guys, Does anyone know how to detect the contract have implemented somehow interface method , such as ERC165

–ê–º–∏—Ä: Ping each of them?) (reply to 73574)

&rey: You mean "contract processes specific message opcode" or "contract has get-method with specified ID"? (reply to 73574)

Allen: I want to know whether a certain contract complies with the implementation of a specific contract. For example, how can I judge whether a certain contract is an NFT master? There is a similar method in EVM (EIP-165). I saw that tact mentioned the relevant OTP(OTP-001). But in func, is there any way for me to determine the contract type ? (reply to 73577)

&rey: TEP-62 (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#nft-collection-smart-contract) defines NFT collection contract as one having three specific get-methods: get_collection_data, get_nft_address_by_index and get_nft_content. You can simply attempt calling those get-methods and see if they succeed. (reply to 73579)

&rey: (In particular, contract types are not mutually exclusive. There can be jetton wallet which is jetton master itself.)

Allen: But this method requires special processing for a certain contract. Is there any method that can be processed like EIP-165? If I want to determine whether it is a wallet contract, NFT item or a specific contract (reply to 73580)

Allen: /

Allen: Like tact otp001. If your contract implements a specific type of contract, your method id will match a specific hash. Through the hash of the get method id, it is easy to determine whether it is a specific contract type.

Dhruv: hello devs, can anyone please help me here, how to wait till send transaction is completed? The storeOnDB function gets called after sending the send transaction but i want it to call after the send transaction is executed, how can i make it possible.   const mintPost = async (data) => {         if (!postContractInstance) return;          const res = await postContractInstance.send(             sender,             {                 value: parseTon("0.05")             },             {                 $$type: 'Mint',                 query_id: BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)),             }         ).then(async () => {             await storeOnDB(data);         });     }

&rey: You need to wait until tx (probably send from the wallet) is recorded on blockchain. Are you doing this in backend or frontend? (reply to 73591)

Dhruv: I'm doing it from frontend, but the storeOnDB funtion is called right after the "send" transaction is send to the blockchain not after completly executing on the blockchain. (reply to 73591)

&rey: You know that any code executed on frontend side cannot be trusted, right? (so location of `storeOnDB`cannot be relied on in security context) (reply to 73595)

Dhruv: so I can not make call storeOnDB funtion after completion of send transaction? (reply to 73596)

&rey: First let me guess what you're trying to do: You want to allow users to mint your tokens, limiting the offer either to unique users or by mint count. Said check is done at frontend side in your example. (reply to 73598)

Smart: i am not able to pay with stars, when confirmation modal button "confirm and pay star" pressed, it says please wait and then request for payment has expired. has somebody same issue?

&rey: I guess this is offtop for this chat. (reply to 73601)

Dhruv: what I am doing is allowing user to mint token and after that I'm storing some data of the user on DB. So what my issue here is, that the mint tx is sent to the blockchain and then without even comfirming that mint tx is executed succesfully the storeOnDB function is executing, so now if the mint tx is got failed in that case also the storeOnDB function is executeing. (reply to 73599)

&rey: The problem is, a malicious user can simply call storeOnDB without sending any transactions (regardless of how you write your script). Is it alright with your usecase? (reply to 73603)

&rey: You cannot pay more fee. You cannot make your message be processed after or before another. (reply to 73622)

&rey: Actually, if you have already seen another message, it's quite likely it will be processed before yours.

&rey: You should become a validator yourself; then, in a block generated by your validator, you can put your own external messages before any others. (reply to 73625)

Christian: Hi, I try to create a signed transaction on a backend and send the base64 encoded transaction to a frontend where it is processed with tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(... payload...).  I was able to make the transaction on the backend with a wallet in the backend using pytoniq. I'm able to send the unsigned transaction to the frontend, which fails there, because it is not signed with the backends wallet. Question: maybe someone has a peace of code how to sign the transaction with pyoniq.  My second try is to create the transaction with tonlib-rs in rust:  let now = SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)?.as_secs() as u32;     let body = signer_wallet.create_external_body(now + 60, seqno.try_into()?, transfer_cells)?;     let signed = signer_wallet.sign_external_body(&body)?;      let wrapped = signer_wallet.wrap_signed_body(signed, false)?;     let boc = BagOfCells::from_root(wrapped);     let tx = boc.serialize(false)?;  I fail here to understand what boc.serialize format is. In the python version I have to base64 the boc, here I dont know what vec<u8> contains.  Question summarized: Any idea, how to create a base64_raw_transaction with pytoniq or better tonlib-rs that can be consumed as rawTxBase64 in sendTransaction? Example:  const response = await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({     validUntil: Math.floor(new Date() / 1000) + 360,     messages: [         {             address: destinationAddress,             payload: rawTxBase64,             amount: "100000000"         },     ], });

musashi: oh that's quite similar to airdrop =)

Christian: Yes, maybe it's the same, thanks for the hint üòäÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

musashi: yeah, your goal is something like by somehow you take money from users wallet without their permission which is impossible

Buggy: Any new project?

Christian: In ethereum context it is a relay transaction I think. In this context the backends jetton wallet would give the permission by creating the raw (offline) transaction. The users wallet would send this transaction and has to pay the ton fee.

&rey: b5ee9c72 is hex, not base64. You need to modify code correspondingly. (reply to 74223)

&rey: Well, this is THE reason why NFTs are not stored inside collection but in separate contracts instead. (reply to 74232)

User<91545419>: Hello, I need help with a couple of questions.  I need to implement a feature where a user transfers USDT to a wallet in Telegram and enters from which wallet they transferred. The system should check by polling an endpoint whether the money has arrived from the specified address or not. Please suggest the simplest and most convenient service for this. If there are other ways to achieve the same result, that will also do.  Additionally, I need the ability to send USDT from our Telegram wallet to the user's specified wallet.  If there is something already available, that would be even better. Thank you for your answers.

Teiv ü¶¥: Hello everyone, I would like to ask about front-end development for Telegram MiniApp.  Currently, I'm designing everything based on iPhones from Pro to Pro Max. But how can I ensure that the app fills the screen on all phones when accessed? Similar to Hamster Kombat, where almost every phone accessing it can have the same screen ratio. So, to handle cases like this, what technologies do I need to use for the Front-end? Thank you.  We primarily focus on Back-end, so we are also learning front-end to serve MiniApp design better.

Dave Martin: Hi guys this might be a bit of a strange one but I‚Äôm just reaching out as I‚Äôm looking for someone that can launch projects on Ton and has access to the Ton community.   So I‚Äôve had quite bit of work done on my project that was going to launch on BSC.   I have token staking, website, dual token lottery, NFT staking with APR boosters and a game dev building me a battle game similar to Fortnite.   My partner who‚Äôs the Dev was meant to be launching for me but he‚Äôs really busy with his job.   So I‚Äôm kind of stuck looking for someone that may be interested in coming onboard as a full partner and help me launch these products on TON.   As I said the original plan was to launch on BSC but I‚Äôve been researching about TON and love what you guys are doing.   I am really not tech savvy so have no clue to launch everything So I‚Äôm trying to find someone capable of launching everything on TON and is capable of reaching out to the huge Ton community in return for becoming a equal partner in my project and helping me do some great things.  If there is anyone that‚Äôs up for coming onboard on this with me you can DM me then I‚Äôll be able to show you what I have already built ready to go.

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Hey there guys, i got a question. Does the boc of a mempool transactions hold where that transaction is going and the full payload?

Pouya: how about this situation: I want to deploy an NFT collection(imagine a Number collection, any item is a positive number) that anyone can mint one or many desired numbers. for example: how should we check that number 45632¬† is minted or not? in normal situations and without limits in storage, etc. I think a map can be a good idea  regarding TVM and Tact documents any smart contract can have about 65000 cells and it constrains the storage limit of maps to be about 30000 key-value pairs for the whole contract constrains the storage limit of maps to be about 30000 key-value pairs for the whole contract.  conclude that a map is not a good idea for handling the collection with a lot of items and we can not use incremental ID for this type of collections  I have an idea but the implementation is not ready yet, I will share it here to discuss about it ASAP  but if there is any solution I'm happy to listen, learn and discuss about that      https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/maps#limits-and-drawbacks (reply to 74240)

&rey: 1. I'm not sure you even need a collection at all; 2. Let NFT itself check whether it's minted or not. (reply to 74273)

Pouya: but we should have a master collection with child item with NFT TEP abstraction  and how to Let NFT itself check whether it's minted or not? (reply to 74274)

&rey: Role of collection can be significantly reduced. NFT is a smart contract, so it itself can be responsible for storing whether it is minted appropriately or not. (reply to 74275)

Pouya: do you accept this: the mint function should be in collection contract and the collection contract should deploy child(item) contracts? (reply to 74276)

&rey: No to both. (reply to 74278)

Pouya: I cannot understand  Could you please provide more description? (reply to 74279)

&rey: Collection MAY be a contract that simply provides common metadata and interface for calculating NFT address by index. In particular, collection MAY or MAY NOT know if an NFT is deployed while calculating its address. (reply to 74280)

&rey: NFT is a smart contract. NFT MAY be deployed by anyone; it MUST store collection address; it can store flag which would indicate if it was initialized appropriately (for instance, with all appropriate payments going through it).

Anon: Hi how to get from public key address of TON wallet what hash it crypting when going from public key to address and what to make to made address from public key?

&rey: public key ‚Äî> wallet initial data cell ‚Äî> wallet initial state (StateInit) ‚Äî> representation hash (SHA-256) is hash-part of address, workchain is usually 0. (reply to 74285)

Anon: we have this all alredy but how to give public addresses from public key (reply to 74287)

Pouya: how should we restrict items to not be duplicated? for instance, user A mints (or deploys manually with correct init cell data) and after that user B does it again (item 4545)  if we provide the owner address in the init data, then the number 4545 has two duplicated item  I think the collection contract should store the valid item address (reply to 74284)

&rey: Make init data not contain the owner address, then. Or contain two zero bits (null address) instead. (reply to 74290)

Pouya: and how to set the owner? after deploying? and if we have a function that sets the owner and we put a condition to just be able to invoke onetime what is someone set the owner faster than us?  I have this idea: deploy the item contract without the owner address in the init data but send the setOwner invoke command in the deploy message body (reply to 74294)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Does anyone know some deep/complete literature about fundamentals of how TON works? I'm coming from EVM and that's kinda hard honestly to get on Ton's page. Especially that BOC stuff

&rey: What happens? Exactly same as if collection received request for mint earlier. (reply to 74296)

&rey: https://docs.ton.org/learn/docs really helps. Also, forgetting about EVM is often a good idea. (reply to 74297)

Pouya: and when the collection contract wants to check if the number was minted or not, just calculate the address of the child with constant init data(number, collection address, etc) and send a message with a predefined structure  if item(child) response to the message then the collection can return an error that the number minted and if collection did not received reply from child generated addresses or got error then the item did not minted and able to minty (reply to 74298)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Thanks, i kinda skipped those even tho they are probably the most complete lol (reply to 74299)

O: Up (reply to 74312)

Pouya: Do you mean this : sent a message to deploy an NFT contract(item) with init code and init data(metadata,collection address, and do not provide owner address in init data) + put setOwner(deployer_address) function invoke  to the body of message  if contract with the provided init code and provided init data(metadata,collection address) did not exist it will be deploy and the setOwner will invoke exactly and nobody can invoke setOwner() faster  and it the provided init code and provided init data(metadata,collection address) exist, we got error   Have I understood correctly?

Willie: Hey everyone. I'm playing with the idea of moving the project I'm working on to TON, but there's one crucial part that I need to know and which I wasn't able to find in the docs. Does TON support extended public keys and derivation of new addresses from the xpub? Or is there maybe a different system with similar functionality?  I'm working on a product which requires custodial wallets for users and I don't want to generate private keys for every single one of them due to security reasons. EVM chains allow me to derive master key from the seed, derive xpub from the master and then derive new wallets without generating individual private keys for them unless the funds needs to be moved. I've got the whole infrastructure mapped out and it's working on EVM chains, but I have no idea how to replicate it (if even possible) on TON.

Trassos: By mistake, I deployed a smart contract on the mainchain on TON. That drained some coins from the account. How strange it was to see them back in the wallet today.

SePi: Mate, the developer needs to write the smart contract by themselves (reply to 74693)

Valamar.$888: Yeah they had to do the basics structure and functions but maybe through the help of AI the smart contracts could be better through expanding the opportunities possible also the users develop them but in a more user friendly interface which they can use multiple fundamentals to build and deploy their projects.

In EVM, it is somewhat alleviated by instant cross-contract interaction, but on TON this is the second most-important problem when writing smart contracts (the first being how to allocate TON to messages and balances). Whatever IDE or AI provides useful tools for that, can be used, I think. (reply to 74703)

Valamar.$888: Hi guys I have another interesting idea I need to show you . It's about a new Consensus mechanisms that can be used in the TON Blockchain platform and network . Well it's not maybe completely done but I like it . Anyway review it and tell me your thought.   Proof of Reserves (PoR) is a consensus mechanism that ensures nodes have sufficient financial backing or resources to validate transactions and add new blocks. This concept is particularly useful for enhancing transparency and trust in blockchain networks, especially in contexts like stablecoins, exchanges, or financial services.   Overview   Proof of Reserves (PoR) requires nodes to demonstrate they possess a certain amount of reserves or assets before participating in block validation. This mechanism ties the security and reliability of the blockchain to the tangible resources held by the validators.   Key Components  1. Reserve Requirements :    - Minimum Reserve Threshold: Nodes must hold a minimum amount of reserves, which could be in the form of cryptocurrencies, fiat money, or other assets.    - Periodic Audits : Reserves are periodically audited to ensure compliance. Audits can be conducted by third parties or through on-chain verification mechanisms.  2. Verification Process:    - Proof Submission : Nodes submit cryptographic proofs of their reserves. These proofs can be linked to external audits or on-chain data.    - Public Ledger : Proofs of reserves are published on a public ledger for transparency, allowing the network to verify the authenticity of the claims.  3. Validation and Consensus :    - Eligibility Check : Only nodes that meet the reserve requirements are eligible to participate in block validation.    - Stake and Penalty: Nodes may need to stake a portion of their reserves as collateral. If they act maliciously or fail to maintain the required reserves, they forfeit the staked assets.  4. Incentives :    - Rewards :Nodes that successfully validate blocks receive rewards, which can be proportional to their reserves.    - Reputation System : Nodes earn reputation points for maintaining reserves and acting honestly, which enhances their chances of being selected for future validations.  5. Security and Transparency:    - Anti-Sybil Measures :  Requiring significant reserves prevents Sybil attacks by making it costly to create multiple fake nodes.    - Transparency : Regular publication of reserve proofs ensures transparency and builds trust in the network.  Advantages :   - Increased Trust: Tying validation power to tangible reserves enhances trust and reliability. - Security: Significant reserve requirements deter malicious actors and Sybil attacks. - Transparency : Public proof of reserves ensures accountability and transparency.   Challenges :   - Reserve Verification: Ensuring accurate and tamper-proof verification of reserves can be complex. - Barrier to Entry : High reserve requirements might exclude smaller participants, leading to potential centralization. - Audit Reliance: Depending on external audits can introduce additional complexities and trust issues.    Implementation Steps :   1. Define Reserve Requirements : Establish the types and amounts of reserves required for nodes to participate in validation. 2. Develop Verification Mechanisms : Create cryptographic proofs and audit procedures to verify and publish reserves. 3. Design Incentive Structures: Implement reward and penalty systems to incentivize honest participation. 4. Implement Security Measures: Introduce measures to prevent Sybil attacks and ensure the integrity of the verification process. 5. Ensure Transparency: Regularly publish reserve proofs on a public ledger for community verification.  Example Scenario:   1. Reserve Declaration: A node declares it has 1,000 tokens as reserves.

Super Man: Hello, I've installed ton keeper pro. would you please let me know how to set testnet on it kindly? (reply to 74881)

Valamar.$888: 2. Proof Submission: The node submits a cryptographic proof of these reserves, verified by an on-chain mechanism. 3. Validation Eligibility: The node becomes eligible to validate blocks, staking a portion of its reserves as collateral. 4.Block Validation: The node participates in validating transactions and adding new blocks. 5.Audit and Verification: Periodic audits ensure the node maintains the required reserves. Successful audits increase the node's reputation. (reply to 74896)

Valamar.$888: So in my thoughts by focusing on financial backing, Proof of Reserves could provide a secure and transparent consensus mechanism particularly suitable for applications where trust and transparency are paramount.

Vitor: So, Proof of Stake? (reply to 74901)

Valamar.$888: Yeah type of (reply to 74902)

Vitor: There's hundreds of variations of PoS out there. Take some look at the Avax papers, as it's well written and academic, learn how to simulate this, and if you have novel results, share. Quite frankly, what you shared so far is so generic that i won't critique. (reply to 74904)

Valamar.$888: Thnx so much (reply to 74908)

&rey: Do you have any issues with current TON model? (reply to 74904)

Ankit j: Any input on this ? (reply to 74895)

Valamar.$888: It's not that I have issues only with TON , but I hate PoS so much that I don't know where this hate comes from , and I was looking if new Blockchain networks use other Consensus Mechanisms (reply to 74911)

Valamar.$888: Like PoS gives a sense of centralisation to the whole network

&rey: Please don't let emotions cloud your judgement, as in Web3 it may lead you to taking more risk without associated gains. (reply to 74913)

Anastasiia: Hi! I have few questions:   Docs which describe storage fee contain the following statement: "Only unique hash cells are counted for storage and fwd fees i.e. 3 identical hash cells are counted as one". But it seems to be related to the unique hash cells in scope of a currently executed contract and if we have few contracts that need the same code, we may use library cells.   So the question is: If we store the same data in the library cell, how storage fee is calculated if we have many contracts using it? Are library cells actively used on mainnet or is it a perk for better future?

Anastasiia: If you reference the refund from EVM, where if you delete the contract, you get some ETH back, it's not working this way on TON. Storage fee on TON is paid for the time your contracts exists on-chain and is charged every time someone sends the message to the contract, so there gonna be no refund. If your contract has too small balance to pay, it will be frozen. The most you can get is the contract's balance that left on the contract when you delete it.   https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/fee-calculation#storage-fee (reply to 74907)

Carterüßπ: Which dev ecosystem has the best support for TON? I've seen a few SDKs but nothing that supports everything:  Mempool/block proposal subscriptions (Overlay?)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: This requires special wallet contract (v5), and special workflow where user signs his tx (and additional tx for transferring USDT as fee to provider), then this two messages are sent via http api to provider, provider checks both and pushes them both to blockchain/node. Provider pays TON for both tx fees, but one of them is your transfer USDT to provider, so you actually buy some TOn from provider (reply to 75062)

Ingvarr: Hello everyone. I'm using pytonlib and tonsdk together. But I've got a problem with seqno conception. Transactions aren't always sent successfully and I don't even realize how it really works. I consider I've coded everything properly, transactions are proceed sometimes, but some of them are shown neither on tonscan nor history of my wallet that I'm sending from  This is how I'm getting seqno:  async def get_seqno(address: str):     try:         data = await client.raw_run_method(             method="seqno", stack_data=[], address=address         )         return int(data["stack"][0][1], 16)     except Exception as e:         logger.error(f"Unable to get seqno: {e}")  And this is how I'm sending transactions:  query = wallet.create_transfer_message(     to_addr=address,     amount=to_nano(0.02, "ton"),     seqno=seqno + 1,     payload=comment, )  await client.raw_send_message(query["message"].to_boc(False))  And I'm facing the following error message:  LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot apply external message to current state : External message was not accepted Cannot run message on account: inbound external message rejected by transaction 5C10830AA9F52D7840DBC1C71E0AF410A281E3AFD4D5473DFACFF3CFABE3AB24: exitcode=33, steps=23, gas_used=0 VM Log (truncated): ...te NOW execute LEQ execute THROWIF 36 execute PUSH c4 execute CTOS execute LDU 32 execute LDU 32 execute LDU 256 execute LDDICT execute ENDS execute XCPU s4,s3 execute EQUAL execute THROWIFNOT 33

Konstantin: HI there! Is any one know why contract address is different if I'm trying get this adres directly from my contract and if I'm getting that address from jetton standard method  There are examples:  contract = await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address);  contract.address == jetton.getGetWalletAddress(gamer.address); ---> FALSE   But code for getGetWalletAddress is the same like      get fun get_wallet_address(owner_address: Address): Address {         let init: StateInit = initOf MyWallet(owner_address, myAddress());         dump(contractAddress(init));         dump(owner_address);         dump(myAddress());         return contractAddress(init);     }  so all values are correct owner_address and myAddress() in contract the same as in MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address) but always contractAddress(init) not equal  await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address).address  Thanks!

midcurve: Hi did you find out about this?? (reply to 70811)

&rey: Yes. Tonkeeper authors (tonapi) reveal your external messages before they are included in blockchain, and someone can race with you sending a lot of their messages. (reply to 75912)

&rey: 1. Let owner pass the jetton wallet address, it is the simplest solution. If you need jetton wallet address in another handlers, say so, it has a more complex solution.  2. Let owner pass the amount to withdraw. It is impossible to read jetton wallet balance onchain.

Nabhdeep: Is there a way to precompute Address with just the public key  without hitting await getAddress()

Roman: Hi! I need to get all the NFTs (from a particular collection) that belong to a specific owner. Is there any efficient way to do so? I mean i can fetch all NFTs one-by-one for this collection and filter only those that are owned by the user.

&rey: tonapi.io or dton.io/graphql offer this. (reply to 76592)

Valamar.$888: Is it possible for a chain split at TON Blockchain happened when one uses POS and the other POW

&rey: In TonWeb, no, as its hash operations are somewhy async and you can't work around having to hash wallet's StateInit. (reply to 76591)

Nabhdeep: I have see address whose status is uninitiated and they still receive token then   How are the addresses computed? There must be a programmatic way to calculate it. Like in EVM chains we can compute addresses with the help of public key (reply to 76595)

&rey: Workchain can be chosen from 0 (basechain) and -1 (masterchain). Hash part is representation hash of contract StateInit cell. (reply to 76598)

–ì–ª–µ–±: Hello, when will we be able to see the second quarter?

‚Äî 2024-06-30 ‚Äî

Nabhdeep: Then how is this possible as there is no contract deployed on this address   My question is how can i calculate the address without that async call? (reply to 76691)

Pegu: Yeah my bad, question wasnt the best. I'm trying to create a contract that interacts with all jettons tokens, like a vault tax'ish kind of contract. Is there any contract reference that handles jettons? (reply to 76038)

Nabhdeep: As you said <workchain>:<contract Statinit> but no contact is deployed on this address (reply to 76712)

Stepan: Is there any way to trigger NFT sell order at getgems.io from my smart-contract?

Stepan: I have a contract that owns some NFTs and I want to make it sell NFTs via marketplace

Stepan: Address is calculated from contract's code and initial data. (reply to 76693)

Nabhdeep: Then how is this address valid. Even this address doesn‚Äôt have an contract deployed

Nabhdeep: No contract deployed then there is no contract code (reply to 76726)

Stepan: Just like in ETH and BTC you can send tokens to any address despite of it's private key or smart contract exists

Stepan: If there is no smart-contract and initial data matching this address it will be in such state forever

Nabhdeep: How can i calculate the address without these details.. There must be a way to calculate address as TON also did it (reply to 76733)

Stepan: I suppose you can calculate wallet address from mnemonic/privkey (reply to 76734)

Adapt: Hi, what is the factor or reason that quite often newer internal transaction is minted before some other older transactions? I understand the async way blockchain is built but it's a little bit confusing when some newer jetton swap is minted in one block and other older swap is minted in like 2-3 minutes time window (within many blocks range). What is the mechanism that tells that this event (bunch of internal transactions) will go smoothly in literally 1 block and the other will be split in many blocks? thanks

Nabhdeep: To be more clear   How are TON uninitialised addresses generated?  Is there a way to precalculate it without async call to getAddress(). Just like we calculate it ETH and BTC using public key (reply to 76734)

&rey: Well, it doesn't need to be deployed? (reply to 76714)

Nabhdeep: So how is that address calculated then (reply to 76762)

&rey: From initial contract state. It doesn't need to be present onchain, though. (reply to 76765)

Nabhdeep: If there is no contract deployed  then what would be the initial contract state (reply to 76766)

&rey: Only the program which generated the address knows. Wallet app generates initial state for wallet contract and shows only address, for instance. (reply to 76768)

Nabhdeep: Can you please explain how was this generated then?

Dmytro: Hello! My liteserver was working fine for a week, but something happened overnight. Blocks are still coming in, but for some reason, the state is not being serialized. According to the logs, it hasn't been updated since around 10 PM the previous day. At 4 AM, serialization occurred at 04:22:41.479231663 - started serializing persistent state for (-1,8000000000000000,38717249), and then the same thing happened at 5 AM. However, in real-time, the data is not being serialized, and the status shows a delay that is only increasing, not decreasing. According to the logs, last_known_key_block_ago is also only increasing.

Pegu: How do i enforce a certain amount of fees to be stored in the contract?   My contract flow e.g. -> Receives 1 TON -> Send raw message out 0.9 TON (Essentially taking 0.1 as fees)  Message mode is configured to 0  However, my contract is receiving less than 0.1 TON.  Is it due to rent fees or did i misconfigure stuff?

&rey: Both storage and compute fees. Please take a look at raw_reserve. (reply to 77458)

Nabhdeep: is there a function which can parse rawBody of a txn?  example  b5ee9c7201010101000e000018d53276db0002a4bb2924ffff  Expected  query_id: 744073709551615

&rey: It isn't a good idea to send messages (from wallet) with mode not involving +2. (reply to 77473)

Nabhdeep: insufficient TON (reply to 77476)

Jimmy Becen: nope, I still have balance, it stops when I try to send tons to another wallet (reply to 77478)

Nabhdeep: probably  the amount you are trying to send it > than ton balance (reply to 77479)

Nabhdeep: can we use query_id for our use like assigning a unique uint64 to it? (reply to 77475)

&rey: It's worth noting that query_id can't be trusted to be unique (clients may select number of their choice), so it can only be used to speed up transaction processing. (reply to 77485)

Sunil | Aerius Labs: How to check if a transaction is success or not, after sending a transaction ?

&rey: The first step is to define success for the exact transaction you sent. (reply to 77488)

&rey: Yes. (reply to 77471)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Is it better to submit TX to a public RPC vs a private node? I see my TX land a few blocks after others... Should I submit transactions to a public endpoint?

&rey: Wider you distribute the external, earlier it may be recorded. (reply to 77492)

Nabhdeep: what do you mean by "define success" here? (reply to 77489)

Sunil | Aerius Labs: Assume out four transaction I am defining last transaction as success ? (reply to 77489)

Nabhdeep: as i also wanted the same thing 1. Txn is only for a contract what if the txn was success for current wallet_contact but failed at destination? current will still show success

&rey: Transaction chains may have many different outcomes. Let's take a DEX swap: balances may be totally unchanged; tokens may get to the DEX but get eaten somehow; swap may complete but excess TON would not be delivered correctly; etc.  Also, transactions are not literally arranged in chains; jetton transfers usually have two final transactions, those being transfer notification and excess TON return. (reply to 77499)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Ok thanks :) (reply to 77494)

Nabhdeep: so you meant that excess TON return can be considered as success? (reply to 77502)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Did the github get altered? I am trying to install MyTonCtrl to setup another node but I am getting this error now:  TON does not exists, building --2024-07-01 13:24:36--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/ton_installer.sh 2024-07-01 13:24:36 ERROR 404: Not Found.

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): I just used this command the other day to setup nodes tho so weird its broken now

musashi: I think he mean that you need to define success like what's your expectation for some unit tests (reply to 77506)

Nabhdeep: then to be sure we would have to follow the whole chain   for Jetton txn    // sender_wallet_contact-> sender_jetton_wallet-> receiver_jetton_wallet (reply to 77509)

Nabhdeep: or is there some point in the whole txn chain Like after this point that chain will not fail? (reply to 77509)

&rey: There might be. For instance, if you send jetton transfer request (with all previous being complete) when jetton balance and attached TON are sufficient, then that transfer will eventually succeed. (reply to 77512)

Pegu: I've added raw_reserve but it seemed like it kept more than what was indicated  My contract process -> Receives 1 TON -> Calculates fee -> raw_reserves(fee, 0) -> send_raw_message(1 TON - fee, mode = 0)  Is there anything wrong here? (reply to 77464)

Sagara: Hi,  I'm trying to run a ton RPC node for few days now. I have followed the latest documentation changes (Changes after 2024/06/28).  I have few issues in 3 different nodes.  Node 1. Liteserver node configuration script is pointing to missing file. (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/ton_installer.sh) So I'm unable to try the liteserver node setup.  Node 2. I tried to build a Full node and use that as RPC node and facing few issues. - Node set up initially worked well and started to sync slowly. - To speed up, I download the latest dump(https://dump.ton.org/dumps/latest.tar.lz) and used that as a DB but it's not picking up the dump data and not even syncing now. Even though both mytoncore and validator is running without errors.  I see the local validator status as "Local validator out of sync: 1719846019 s", value is increasing. Don't see DB size increase(It's stuck at 638 GB).  Node 3. This VM with 32 CPU and 128 GM RAM which I need to set up for a Full node. It is giving me some different errors. With all below point, I see the DB side increase and it's about 720 GB now. - Does not show the Local validator status. Tried to add the local wallet key as suggested in the documentation. But getting a file lock error. At the same time it shows as wallet is set as well as it's already set. - In mytoncore service show this error "save_db error: lock_file error: time out." - In logs I see this log not sure it's a error or not "does not have a valid ShardAccount to unpack"   Can you please help me with this?

‚Ä¢: Tact is more undestandable and readable, but has more gas optimization issues. It is from community and it is beta. Func native language from TON. It is more hard for understand, more low-level.

Mikael: Hi.  who has had experience integrating payments in Jetton into a smart contract on Tact, please tell me a couple of points: 1. How do you identify by Transfer Notification, what is the address of the master contract for this token  2. How do you send tokens back to the user (if such logic is provided in the contract) 3. Could you drop off examples of contracts where this implementation takes place?

&rey: Blockchain does not offer functionality to generate checks. You can generate invoice offline in form https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/<your-address>?amount=<nanoTON> and show to user. (reply to 78250)

Nerses: is there address 0 in TON like in ethereums addres(0)  ?

&rey: Yes. For what? (reply to 78270)

Nerses: in case i have address field as an argument I could use address 0 as NULL (reply to 78272)

&rey: Two zero bits are appropriate in this usecase. (reply to 78273)

Nerses: 1) how can I check that address is zero address (reply to 78274)

&rey: Preload two bits of address. If they are zero, this address is null address.

Nerses: 2) how to check if argument with address type can handle certain type of message ?

Nerses: I mean that argument is address of smart contract (reply to 78278)

Nerses: how that check can be done in tact smart contract ? (reply to 78277)

Nerses: after doing let addr: Slice = Address.asSlice() will it modify initial address ?

&rey: Oh. I don't remember Tact all that well, but seems like message Msg {     out: Address?; } receive(m: Msg) {     if (m.out == null) { } else { } } should work. (reply to 78284)

Precious | UZX: . (reply to 78032)

Nerses: i tried to do something like this         let messengerAddress: Slice = msg.data.__messenger.asSlice();         let twoBits: Slice = messengerAddress.preloadBits(2); (reply to 78290)

&rey: Better .preloadUint(2) == 0. (reply to 78295)

&rey: You cannot. (reply to 78278)

Nerses: i think your approach is better to do that check.In case it doesnt work I will do .preloadUint(2) == 0 (reply to 78297)

&rey: Because there were one or two migrations. Old packages are marked deprecated IIRC. (reply to 78301)

Nerses: send(SendParameters{to: msg.data.__messenger,                                 bounce: true,                                 value: 20000000,                                 mode: 0,                                 body: HTLCNotify {data: HTLCNotification {                                                                             htlcID: msg.data.__hashlock,                                                                             sender: msg.data.__sender,                                                                             receiver: msg.data.__srcAddress,                                                                             amount: ctx.value,                                                                             timelock: msg.data.__timelock,                                                                             hashlock: msg.data.__hashlock,                                                                             dstAddress: msg.data.__targetCurrencyReceiverAddress,                                                                             phtlcID: msg.data.__phtlcID                                                                         }}.toCell()});           } for this code I get error Invalid type "Address?" for fields "to" with type Address in type SendParameters Line 237, col 33:   236 |         if(msg.data.__messenger != null){ > 237 |             send(SendParameters{to: msg.data.__messenger,                                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   238 |                                 bounce: true,    why it throws error ?

Nerses: thanks very much (reply to 78306)

&rey: The reverse. @ton/ton, @ton/core and @ton/crypto are fine. (reply to 78309)

0x0liver: hello @pcrafter do you know it? (reply to 78208)

Julien: Hey there! On Ston.fi, how can I get the expected amount out, or the real one even, with the API? I'm doing the swap like this, but I can't find where I can get this info. THanks a lot  P.S. I searched in the chat history but found nothing

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): How can we get our transactions to land faster with private node?

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): I can see other users hitting the next block when submitting a TX but my node takes a minute to fully land? I see the TX enter the pool right away

Nerses: will i pay transaction fee for this getter     get fun getHTLCDetails(hashlock: Int): HTLC? {         return self.contracts.get(hashlock);     } ?

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Is there a way to bribe a validator or set a gas fee to land faster on TON?

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Or should I turn my node into a full validator to land faster?

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): How are these mevs pushing a transaction infront of mine when mine is in the pool before the mev can submit his?

JohnnyBlaze üß≤: hi, does anyone know of any TON tracker wallet bots?

JohnnyBlaze üß≤: and also, is there a thing like Bubble map for Ton as well? :)

&rey: Externals get recorded in arbitrary order IIRC. You can't change gas fee to be faster. Being full validator would help. In blocks generated by you. (reply to 78338)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): This is what I thought. But how is a MEV submitting his TX before mine when mine is already in order in public pool? (reply to 78350)

&rey: No unless you call it from other functions in contract (onchain). (reply to 78335)

Nerses: so this operation self.contracts.get(hashlock);  doesnt affect as it doesnt change state ? (reply to 78354)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Is there a way to grab the top validators and submit my TXs directly to them instead of the node to pool?

Kevin.eth: Is there an rpc for exploring the chain?

Ben: ü´°

Kevin.eth: I‚Äôm looking to create a block listener

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): You would want to host your own private node for this so you have no rate limit (reply to 78360)

Kevin.eth: A public node should be enough? What is the avg block time? (reply to 78361)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Public endpoints wont beable to stream the states in realtime usually they limited

Kevin.eth: Is it possible to create a listener at a certain address for every block?

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Yes but you need to parse every transaction looking for the values you want. You will need a node that can send every transaction in realtime and parse the data for what youre looking for. When I tried that with a public end point I would get kicked off right away from rate limiting. I switched to a private node and now I can stream everything in real time no limits no forced closed connections (reply to 78365)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Unless you dont care to see them pending. Then you can just check all the transactions per block after the block is mined

Kevin.eth: Damn, seems complicated af coming from an EVM background. (reply to 78366)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Welcome. I am from EVMs as well. Trying to learn this chain lol (reply to 78368)

JohnnyBlaze üß≤: love to see smart heads around, sup g's

Kevin.eth: Also wtf is FunC, such an esoteric language (reply to 78369)

Tyson (NEVER DM FIRST): Seems they made their own lol (reply to 78371)

Kevin.eth: Also, how do you even create a simple coin? (reply to 78372)

Kevin.eth: With jetton_master?

Mark: Everything is abstracted away so much (reply to 78368)

Kevin.eth: Humbling af not even understanding anything here. (reply to 78375)

Mark: I recently transferred some TON to an address and realized I cannot do anything unless I have a contract deployed

Mark: Wanted to transfer a few tokens to a different address, had to figure out how to use fift and then deploy the contract

&rey: pytoniq has example for this. (reply to 78360)

zeligmann: @pcrafter Hey, can I text you?  I have a question

Sagara: @pcrafter Is there anyone who resolved the issue mentioned in https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api/issues/87 This is related to ton-http-api  [2024-07-02 17:38:41 +0000] [8] [ERROR] Exception in ASGI application Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/uvicorn/protocols/http/h11_impl.py", line 366, in run_asgi    ..............................     raise RuntimeError(f'No working liteservers with ls_index={ls_index}, archival={archival}') RuntimeError: No working liteservers with ls_index=None, archival=None

Rae: Anyone know the timezone for the Dora hackathon cut off for ton league

Bands: Same bro lmk if you found the solution (reply to 78377)

&rey: Yes. It is done automatically, though. If there are any fees they are less than 0.01 TON. (reply to 78396)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I have a question about address calculation on the TON blockchain:   when deploying a contract, can we deploy it to an arbitrary address that is independent of its smart contract code?

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: an expert tells me that today, but i think it is quite wierd

Behrang: No you can't. The init_state must match the address. (reply to 78548)

Sagara: @VeryBigBanane  Thanks for the direction. I changed my local code and it is working now. I have another issue to verify. I need to route the traffic to my Ton full node which is acting as a liteserver. Server is in sync. when I generated the liteserver local configuration with mytonctrl> installer> clcf , It generated the file in /usr/bin/ton/local.config.json. But when I convert the decimal value to IP under liteservers list it is not my server ip. I used https://www.browserling.com/tools/dec-to-ip to convert the decimal to ip. How to make sure that requests are routed to my ouw server? (reply to 78390)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Is the rule provided in any document? I can‚Äôt find it in ton docs (reply to 78551)

Behrang: I don't have a link.  First, I have tested it myself.   Second, if you could deploy anything on any address, then all Ton blockchain smart contracts where endangered. I, for example, could deploy a copy of USDT jetton smart contract on my USDT jetton address for the first time and increase my jetton balance and then convert it to any other asset.  Third, try it yourself. (reply to 78556)

Jeonghwan | Cosmostation: Hi all.  I'm wondering how can I get a test Grams for running validator? It seems to be deprecated getting tokens from sending pow ext message.

Zion / Nick: I have seen the documentation regarding the validator, does it mean if we run it we can get fees from running the node? (reply to 78586)

User<7376766125>: Minter does not work any reason

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Could you explain the reason, I think it is dangerous, and dedust will be hacked under this scenario (reply to 78607)

avantor: to get the master chain block id, you should use the specific tools and API (reply to 78608)

charlie: could u share an api to me? thanks a lot! I don't find it and can not find the relation in explore. üò≠ (reply to 78612)

Jeonghwan | Cosmostation: does anyone let me know test giver address on testnet?

avantor: you can check it by tonapi tonapi.io (reply to 78613)

charlie: yes. but the api in this link support query shards info by master seqno rather than support query master seqno by workchain id. could u help more details about it? üôè (reply to 78617)

&rey: Please explain your question on such an example: (reply to 78608)

SHERIF: Please admin, TON crystal is not showing on my Trust Wallet  How do I add TON token?

&rey: I think this is more of question for TON Community chat, or to Trust Wallet support. (reply to 78623)

charlie: for example, the block of work chain will sync in master chain. in addition the ton api support query shards info with master seqno. but how to query master block by workchain block id? (reply to 78620)

&rey: You might not have noticed that single shardchain block can have multiple masterchain blocks corresponding to it (1002; for instance, if shard has some issues). (reply to 78625)

charlie: üòµyes, but theoretically, there will be no problem. in addition I check the tonscan and tonviewer explore. there is no way to check master chain block info even I know I send a transaction.. (reply to 78627)

User<7470537046>: hi

&rey: You should search over masterchain blocks. Use binary search if the block you look for is not recent. (reply to 78628)

Mohammad: Hi

charlie: ic. for example https://tonscan.org/block/0:4000000000000000:44354576 if I want to confirm which master block it is. it's impossible to query. right? I must search over masterchain blocks to get the shards info. (reply to 78631)

abhishek: Hi guys . I have a webapp where users can click on a button. They get a Google login popup and user chooses the account to login and logs in. The popup closes and flow goes back to the website and the user logs in using his Google account.   I want this webapp to be present as a mini app with a bot. So user must be able to go to the bot and click on a button. It should open the webapp in telegram and user should be able to click on a button, login with their Google account and all this should happen in this telegram mini app.  Now when I created a bot and connected this webapp to the bot. I click on the telegram bot link and it does open the webapp. I see the button which says login with Google and when I click on it it gives me a popup for Google login but when I choose a Google account and login. The popup doesn't close and the flow doesn't go back to the telegram mini app . Instead in the telegram mini app , I see the login loader spinning as user has not logged in yet. So can someone help me how do I fix this ?  Also suppose I add a telegram login button in the website. What if I want that when anyone opens this webapp in his telegram, he is automatically logged in with his telegram account. Is this possible? If yes , how do I do it? Can someone help me out here please.  Is there any redirect uri I have to configure here or anything like that ?

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Hey there guys, is there a way to change the FunC compiler in ton blueprint? I'm trying to manually deploy the walletv4 contract but it is on pragma 0.2.2 while blueprints tries to compile it on a higher version. Thanks üôè

Vladimir: Good day.  I have erc20 token with 5% buy/sell fees for uniswap v2 pool  I would like to get it bridged to TON and have same fees on TON DEX  I tried to use bridge.ton.org it created a new jetton then I created a Stone DEX pool  But it - takes only 0.2% fee to LP provider - takes 0.1% to Stone protocol  I see 2 ways 1) find a ton dex with custom fees 2) develop my own jetton with embedded fees on transfers to dex pool and use this customized jetton in bridge   Is there any default solution for fee-on-swap erc20 bridge for TON?  Thank you

charlie: in addition, if the status of one transaction is success, but the event is false. what's the relation between them?

&rey: This isn't question to me but to the first speaker who misled you. You already can use wallet normally, it will be autodeployed on outgoing transfer. (reply to 78695)

lvann: Yes, I switched networks (reply to 78692)

&rey: It is hard. In particular because this causes high load on explorer APIs. (reply to 78655)

mohsen: Is there any detailed documentation on this? (reply to 78697)

&rey: Yes, whitepapers. Consider that wallet contract is first and foremost a smart contract, just with some handy functionality that allows users to command it a bit more than common contracts. (reply to 78700)

&rey: All transactions unrelated to failure will be complete, they won't rollback. (In particular, it's a reason why tree isn't called a single transaction; it is not.) (reply to 78659)

&rey: It is quite the point of TON, by the way. If change is done, something remote (that is, happening on another contract, or in another shard, or in another workchain) cannot affect it. (reply to 78702)

&rey: You'll have to implement check yourself, TVM offers wide range of arithmetic primitives which can help you. Please note that since it is a security-sensitive part, you need to consult existing implementations, pitfalls and write tests (including for edgecases). (reply to 78716)

PoW: @pcrafter pls (reply to 78724)

&rey: Those may be useful depending on which elliptic curve you want to be available. Otherwise, you'll have to reimplement point addition/multiplication with common ADD, MULMOD, etc. (reply to 78724)

PoW: Okay, means I have to implement from zero, thanks, will try to implement it (reply to 78730)

User<5648379066>: I want to show what can be improved in tone! Afternoon. Blockchain has great potential and many areas for improvement. A few suggestions that can make it more advanced and beneficial for developers, users and businesses. Sharding and multithreading improvements to improve performance and scalability. Optimization of existing consensus algorithms to improve throughput and reduce latency. Security and smart contract validation tools to mitigate risks associated with vulnerabilities. Implementing anomaly detection systems to detect network anomalies and prevent and respond to potential attacks. Three. Increasing development efficiency and improving tools. 4. Improving user experience by developing and improving intuitive wallets that are user-friendly across geographies. Five. New integration features with decentralized storage systems such as ipfs, private transactions, decentralized management. These areas can help the ton ecosystem and make it more attractive to developers, users, and businesses.

Stephan: hi guys, please help me, how can I create Jeton for free for development? Is it also possible to get it for free as well as TON on testnet?

musashi: https://minter.ton.org/?testnet (reply to 78753)

Stephan: thank you! (reply to 78755)

musashi: hey guys, I got a weird issue in my sandbox testcase, when I print the transaction fees to console, I got the value out ~ 0.12 TON while I only deposited 0.08 TON to the transaction and the contract balance is ~0.01 TON

Marco: Which language is more popular among developers, FunC or Tact?

Paul: what contract do  you send to? seem is bug. (reply to 78761)

musashi: my customized contract mate (reply to 78764)

musashi: here is the flow: my wallet contract -> send 0.08 TON -> customized contract with 0.01 TON balance -> send a message with 0.12 TON attached to another contract

musashi: how could it possible? 0.12 > 0.08 + 0.01 =)

&rey: @devs is the chat for Telegram Mini Apps development. (reply to 78778)

musashi: what should I do mate @pcrafter (reply to 78761)

Paul: posible if your contract have ton balance. seem your deploy contract transacton send 0.05 ton (reply to 78768)

musashi: no it's just 0.01 TON mate (reply to 78784)

Paul: could you share your address contract

musashi: and one more thing, I do the same transaction again after this transaction, it failed because of action code 37

musashi: i'm doing unit test using sandbox, not deployed yet (reply to 78786)

&rey: Maybe that's balance after the transactions? (reply to 78785)

musashi: no, I'm pretty sure that I deployed the contract with just 0.01 TON in value

Paul: or sandbox can send unlimit, do not validate the balance :(

musashi: one more thing is that before I make the second transaction (which is failed with 37 action code), I config the sandbox blockchain timestamp to 10 mins forward (reply to 78787)

Wira Pratama: I'm trying to add haptic feedback into my app when users click on tabs in a tab bar. My tech stack includes Next.js and Tailwind CSS for styling. I've been going through the Documentation on Haptic Feedback and the methods, but I'm still a bit confused on how to integrate this with Next.js and Tailwind. Any example or reference projects would be greatly appreciated

musashi: btw, how can I get balance of contract in sandbox test sir? I just know the way to get balance of treasury contract (reply to 78789)

Paul: The key difference of this package from ton-contract-executor is the fact that the latter only emulates the compute phase of the contract - it does not know about any other phases and thus does not know anything about fees and balances (in a sense that it does not know whether a contract's balance will be enough to process all the out messages that it produces). On the other hand, this package emulates all the phases of a contract, and as a result, the emulation is much closer to what would happen in a real network.

&rey: NetworkProvider should do this. (reply to 78797)

Illia: can you send the logs?   as far as I remember, printTransactionFees prints combined values which is kind of weird and confusing (i.e., all values added up together)  btw you can use this logger github.com/henchtab/shrek 'cause it shows out values separately + shows labeled contract names, sources/destinations (reply to 78761)

musashi: thanks mate (reply to 78813)

Cube: Still this issue.. (reply to 78743)

Gyorgy: Still ongoing, seems yes. (reply to 78815)

Nerses: can foreach be used for state variables (map)  in TACT ?

Cube: Who knows how to form transactions with Events as described in tonapi (i.e jetton transfer)?

User<5648379066>: Hi everyone how can I create a flashloan arbitrage trading bot on TON blockchain using TON smart contract ?

&rey: You can't. In particular, there is the fact that transaction on loan issuer contract ends before the money is used, so there is no option to reclaim it. (reply to 78840)

&rey: At this point, I believe it is better to switch to FunC. At least, iterating maps needs care and small gas usage, something that Tact does not offer. (reply to 78829)

jaq‚Çøek.eth: https://toncenter.com/api/v3/jetton/wallets?limit=128&offset=0

&rey: You can use another API like dton.io/graphql. Filter for contract deployments. Filter for "parsed jetton admin". Read source address (deployer) and destination (jetton). (reply to 78916)

&rey: It is not standardized but it is most commonly done along with "internal transfer" ‚Äî message depositing jettons to a jetton wallet from other wallet/minter. (reply to 78940)

jaq‚Çøek.eth: ok so if we want to find newly deployed we should look for internal transfer tx's?

jaq‚Çøek.eth: im sorry sir im comming from evm and tryin to get familiar with blockchain of blochains ^^

Ryan: Hey guys, I'm just learning about that rent stuff. If my contract has user's funds in it, but it doesn't have enough TON to pay the rent, it will get frozen.   So it means that the user's funds are now locked and they cannot withdraw it??

Illia: if your user funds are toncoins, then these toncoins will be used up to pay for storage fee  if your user funds are custom tokens (nfts or jettons), then yes, you risk loosing them (reply to 78988)

Raf: hi, did you see my question about opcodes ? thx (reply to 78992)

Barbell: Hi I am having an issue when I store Dictionary <number, Address> in InitState. I am getting error on query of the smart contract. Anyone has any example how to init Dictionary in InitState with same value?

Barbell: you need to query your transaction with seq number. I suggest to add message to transaction so you can easilly fetch and filter the tx which one yoyu looking for (reply to 79027)

Long: Thanks, so I have to get a list of my history tx and filter to get the one I just sent? (reply to 79029)

Illia: the answer very much depends on what client you're using; for example, if you're sending transactions with TON Connect UI, then it will return you the hash of your transaction;  what are you trying to do? you can, for example, deploy NFTs by just checking the next collection ID or your wallet's sequence number (reply to 79030)

Long: I am trying to get the tx hash of the transaction I just sent. So the return of the api call is not the tx then. This is weird. In other blockchain it must return the ts receipt that contains tx hash (reply to 79062)

Illia: I believe more libraries will do that in the future.  https://github.com/VanishMax/foton  Have a look at this one if you're building a frontend with React. If not react, then it's a good reference to how gracefully handle transactions (reply to 79064)

Illia: I will add my two cents. If you want to build extremely optimized smart contracts and understand everything that's happening under the hood, then do FunC. If you want to learn or hack quick 0 to 1 MVPs (what's acceptable in lots of cases), then do Tact. FunC requires lots of technical knowledge that Tact hides by default, making it easier to start building (reply to 79105)

charlie: thanks (reply to 78702)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Good morning everyone, do you know if there is a way to change the FunC compiler version used in Blueprint? I can't compile the walet v4 contract as it is on pragma 0.2.2 and the blueprint compiler on 0.4.x

ztwq: In a word, TACT: quick0-1. FUNC:extremly optimized smart contract. Thanks. (reply to 79247)

Illia: That's strange that you can't compile wallet V4. I would double-check on that. What's the source code you're compiling?  There's no simple answer on changing FunC versions in blueprint. If you very very need (but I don't think you need in your case) you can try chancing the version of func-js-bin  https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton-community/func-js-bin?activeTab=versions  But there's no guarantee it will work ok with blueprint so I better not do that (reply to 79264)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Hey thanks for the answer, i'm trying to compile this code: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/main/func/wallet-v4-code.fc which is i believe the version that is deployed automatically by most of wallets currently working on Ton. I think i will just change the pragma version for now in the wallet's V4 code even though i would have preferred not to as it is more a workaround that a real fix (reply to 79275)

Ilia S.: Dear community, where do I find a documentation for constructing a proper deeplink for opening TG Wallet: a) wallet should be on "send ton to another wallet" screen b) amount, address and description is inserted  I found only this somewhere on repositories: t{dot}me/wallet?&startattach=send-assetCurrency__100 but that opens the "send to user" window, and nothing is inserted / no documentation on what params to add to make this happen.

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: It was actually failing with changing the pragma verison, because of some types issue, i guess some stuffs were not required in 0.2.0 that are now required in 0.4.4. I've copied the code from the deleted walletV4 0.4.4 implementation, and it compiled great. I just hope they did not delete it because of some vulnerabilities üòÅ. Thanks a lot üôè (reply to 79294)

Illia: based on the source code when it was, it was just used in the tests to compare the performance of wallet v4 to wallet v5 and show that wallet v5 is more efficient (reply to 79299)

Illia: btw you can use wallet v5 in your project; that's absolutely great, has good wrappers (if v4 is not requirement for your project) (reply to 79299)

Anh Dung: Hi, I am just going through the tutorial and currently I am at section 7. In file jetton-minter.fc function mint_token I don't see any import decleartion for  function calculate_jetton_wallet_state_init, which is in jetton-utils.fc. How does it work here?

Illia: when you compile FunC you can choose the order for compiling the source code  the first file you compile will be available in all the files compiled afterwards  e.g. func file1.fc file2.fc file3.fc means that file2 and file3 import file1 and file 3 also imports file 2 (reply to 79308)

Anh Dung: thanks, I suppose that this order is written in compile.sh (reply to 79316)

Illia: Exactly mate (reply to 79324)

Anh Dung: Also why do we store jetton_wallet_code twice here? Once in pack_jettton_wallet_data() with store_ref and the second time in calculate_jetton_wallet_state_init() with store_dict?  cell pack_jetton_wallet_data(int balance, slice owner_address, slice jetton_master_address, cell jetton_wallet_code) inline {    return  begin_cell()             .store_coins(balance)             .store_slice(owner_address)             .store_slice(jetton_master_address)             .store_ref(jetton_wallet_code)            .end_cell(); }  cell calculate_jetton_wallet_state_init(slice owner_address, slice jetton_master_address, cell jetton_wallet_code) inline {   return begin_cell()           .store_uint(0, 2)           .store_dict(jetton_wallet_code)           .store_dict(pack_jetton_wallet_data(0, owner_address, jetton_master_address, jetton_wallet_code))           .store_uint(0, 1)          .end_cell(); }

&rey: Because wallets are uninitialized a large chunk of the time. (It is cheaper to have uninit wallet than initialized one.) The funds don't need special processing and shouldn't bounce of such a wallet. (reply to 79155)

&rey: Old kind of jettons (until MYCODE opcode was introduced) stored jetton wallet code in their own data as well. (reply to 79328)

Mithra: Guys, we need help setting a testnet lightnode, we already launched it on Hetzner, but it does not sync. Where can we get help?

Anh Dung: I notice that in all the examples that I have seen that the load_data function always retrieves the whole storage even when only part of it is needed. Isn't it quite inefficient?

&rey: It is. Though, it is rarely noticed. I also do so when starting to write a contract, and only apply optimizations later. (reply to 79347)

User<6943543282>: who can contact for token tonkeeper verification

Tiep: Hello,  how can I send a specific amount of ton to multi wallet with a single transaction using tact lang! I tried to user SendParameters, but it can send only to the first recipient ?

Veaceslav Kunitki: @dev  How on earth can I send coins/jettons (for example, Notcoin) from one wallet to another in Python? No one has a working example. üòû

Illia: You need just to call SendParameters multiple times (reply to 79357)

Illia: I don't have an example, but the main idea is that you need to send an external transaction to your wallet that will contain a valid transfer message. Then, your wallet will accept it (if your signature matches) and forward to your jetton wallet.  Take a look at the standard  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md#1-transfer (reply to 79363)

Tiep: I did it, but only the firstone execute. Is there any special configuration needed? (reply to 79365)

Tiep: Can you plz give me an example !

Illia: What are you sending parameters?  For example, If you have mode SendRemainingValue, then you will have no toncoins to pay for the consequent calls of the send message.  Have a look at this code:  https://github.com/henchtab/nenuma/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/data_stream.tact#L276 (reply to 79370)

Tiep: Appreciate your help. Let me try it out. (reply to 79373)

Veaceslav Kunitki: "your wallet send", "your wallet accept" ? what it need to accept and where to send? (reply to 79366)

Illia: Let's define some actors to simplify the explanation.  Script ‚Äî it's your Python script that sends the transfer request)  Wallet A ‚Äî is a wallet that owns jettons and you have its private key, e.g., V4 or V5 beta (btw I tried V5 yesterday, very nice)  Jetton Wallet A ‚Äî described in the TEP-74; belongs to Wallet A  Jetton Wallet B ‚Äî described in the TEP-74; belongs to Wallet B  Wallet B ‚Äî it's the wallet you're sending your transaction to, i.e., it's the destination address.  Script generates an external message, compatible with Wallet A; it should be the Transfer message compatible with the TEP-74 standard which provides a valid signature to authenticate your external message by the wallet.   Once it's authenticated, i.e., the signature matches the public key stored in the wallet, it will send an internal message to Jetton Wallet A on behalf of Wallet A.   Jetton Wallet A transfers jettons to Jetton Wallet B and now Wallet B has new jettons. Job done!  If you're using pytoniq, you can use this wrapper.  https://github.com/yungwine/pytoniq/blob/master/pytoniq/contract/wallets/wallet.py#L339  Before you send the transaction, make sure to get wallet's seqno and then simply do short pooling until the seqno increments to await the transaction (but don't forget to wait, for example, for 2 seconds before running the seqno getter as you can exceeded timeout based on your API provider) (reply to 79389)

Veaceslav Kunitki: I am trying to use this https://github.com/tonfactory/tonsdk/blob/master/examples/tokens/jetton/transfer.py (reply to 79394)

Illia: i've never worked with this lib (reply to 79398)

Veaceslav Kunitki: ok. No problem. I will be happy with any python code what helps me to make jetton transfer (reply to 79400)

Tiep: Your source code is really helpful ! Thank you again ! (reply to 79373)

Mikael: https://github.com/toncenter/examples/blob/main/withdrawals-jettons.js  Hello everyone, please tell me, I found such a guide from the tone dock. If here  ton web.wallet.all['v3R2'];   - how can this affect the transfer of jetton to users (whose addresses we find out through ton connect)? It's just that as far as I know, now the 4th version of wallets is used by users

Jenya: I don't want to use 2 clients - tonapi and toncenter (reply to 79483)

Illia: That's a good question. Many people asking about that. I'm preparing a tutorial for that right now. The main idea is that you need to create a receiver with transfer_notification opcode. See TEP-74 for mode details (reply to 79444)

Jenya: is it hard to transfer by tonapi? (reply to 79486)

&rey: You need to wrap transfer body in external message, it seems.

Jenya: const internalMessageCell = beginCell()         .store(storeMessageRelaxed(internalMessage))         .endCell();  something like this? (reply to 79490)

Jenya: oh no its internal...

&rey: Like store(external({to: ..., body: raw_transfer})). (reply to 79492)

Jenya: I'il try

Nerses: is there Jetton implementation in TACT ? couldnt find appropriate one for understanding Jetton architecture

Jenya: thank you very much (reply to 79494)

Jenya: it works  const externalMessage = beginCell()         .store(storeMessage(external({to: ownerAddress, body: raw_transfer})))         .endCell().toBoc().toString('base64')

SrDorki: Hi fam! Im getting TonWeb undefinded when i try to send a transaction. Im using java on html. Imported scripts tonconnec-sdk.min.js and tonweb.min.js from unpkg.... i can connect tonkeeper wallet but when I const httpprovider, endpoint and tonweb I get tonweb undefined:  Const { HttpProvider, utils } = window.TonWeb Const endpoint = 'https://toncenter .com/api/v2/jsonRPC' Const tonweb = new TonWeb(new HttpProvider(endpoint))

M: Good day,  Could you please help me? I need to use TonAPI to subscribe to an NFT collection and track when a transfer transaction occurs within that collection. I would like this transaction to be received as an event in a stream. Does TonAPI have something for this? I looked through the documentation on Tonconsole, but the message doesn't contain information about who sent it, where it was sent, or the name of the transaction. Could you please assist me with this issue?

Rozhen: Me and my friends just launched a coin on TON

Stephan: Hi guys, please help me, how can I send my jetton in a contract?

&rey: Send jetton transfer request to jetton wallet of the contract. (reply to 79583)

Stephan: I don't really understand how to do this. Maybe there are some articles on how to do this? (reply to 79600)

&rey: No, Tonapi doesn't have this functionality. Actually I believe it could be a profitable thing to build such API. (reply to 79574)

Stephan: This is the first time I've come across working with jetton (reply to 79600)

&rey: Just same as when you send jetton on frontend. TON Cookbook can help you. (reply to 79602)

Prince: Hi, I wanna deploy contract via blueprint so I use mnemonic. so env I use wallet version as v4 but I get different wallet address. anyone knows that reason?

Gyorgy: for v4 not much difference can be, probably different subwallet id (reply to 79641)

Prince: I see

Gyorgy: wallets typically using this DefaultSubwallet = 698983191 (reply to 79643)

Gyorgy: for v4, for v5 the standard will be 0

Prince: so my test wallet address is 0QDB3TBXG1zJaKP6R8o0gnNZi6WVwSJBkJjc6GZPoNSnynTK but when using blueprint I get EQBgJyFj_w1gsAnF-UqAVeSbpD7AgCU6Dgp3_RxHPkBHwhVC... so diffierent

Gyorgy: wallet standard changed, EQ/UQ depends if wallet or smart contract to control bounce

Prince: so what is the solution? the reason Why I choose using mnemonic is just when I deploy contract on testnet, I don't want to use mobile wallet.

Gyorgy: @pcrafter https://github.com/tonkeeper/tonkeeper-ton/commit/c4ca40117450baaa0b013ec5a3b64f6dea2a67d1#diff-825db445dbe74c1f49c05e985c1607c8c43d60e0161f5ad0ac8b6ddbb419b6c2R91  info from today commit. beta used 0 subwallet id as well. v5r1 (seems official name) aiming for that too

Gyorgy: thats up to your code üôÇ without sharing anything, hard to give any help. ‚Äúits not the same‚Äù. Its not the same as not the same instructions. (reply to 79649)

Gyorgy: If parameters the same, will be the same wallet. Update your code to use different subwallet to match them.

Prince: Thanks, I will try

Prince: so another question, now what is the best choice, most popular deploy the contract on the testnet?

Cryptskii: gm gm! nice to be hear!

Cryptskii: 1st i want to say TON is great and imo which is very hard to please, TON at its core is the only BC that checks all my boxes with only a couple being halfs checks because they are sufficient design choices that are bad just not quite good enough for mass adoption or to be considered as the recommend and choice for replacing banks. SOSO close. This IS the strongest BC and is miles ahead of any other network for being ready for this inevetable need. it would be nice to be fully ready ahead oh the complete banking colapse though no?

Cryptskii: im here with intent to help achieve the levels of privacy and securtiy needed to make TON look at the changes that would be required, for these along wiith higher on-chain scalabiliy

Prince: then can you describe what ton is different from other chain, ton's attractive characters?

Cryptskii: if you are open to my suggestions one big one would be migration from hypercubes to adopting my sharded recusive ZKPs found on eth.research

Cryptskii: are we aloud to share links?

daniel: yes, ton dosnt support ledger , this is a distinct feature, allow scammer, hackers to easily to low cost ton, (reply to 79662)

daniel: share is ok i think, but not publicly loud (reply to 79664)

Prince: let me know more detail... (reply to 79665)

Cryptskii: core sharded architecture you can clearly see the TEAM took things seriously and never had any intentions of riding with vapour on the sucess of TG itself (reply to 79662)

Cryptskii: all choices in TONs desing are well thought out as well as implemtation. TON brings value to telegram not just TG to TON

daniel: yes, they are working hard to make a non wokring ledger apps, and abandon it , leaving ledger users locked the asstes without ability to moving it (reply to 79668)

belac: hey

Prince: then is there any kind of bundle on solana?

daniel: ton is the only chain i know did this

belac: yea (reply to 79673)

Prince: really?

belac: yep

Cryptskii: it would be ideal to remove the need for the payment channels though. ZKPs can do this

belac: doesn't let me type the name it auto deletes

belac: why (reply to 79673)

&rey: ZK development is invested in.

Cryptskii: Solona on the other hand is probably one of the worst BC from a tech standing

&rey: Though please try to combine your thoughts into one message, so that it would be easier to read.

Cryptskii: ethresear   .    ch/t/sharded-recursive-zk-snark-proofs/19480

Cryptskii: i may actually know i thing or 2 and may or may not be one of the handful of fellas actually pushing the tech forward. how you call trailblaze

belac: haha true (reply to 79686)

Cryptskii: or i can just stop talking if your going to be anal like that. just remember you can really change what your potential roster looks like. i wait for someone to reach out then that know better than to be like this as its a really turn off.

Cryptskii: i could bring value here if i feel welcome and accepted for where i excel and for my small quarks you feel the need to poke at after 2 minutes of me being hear. no Kobey or Jordans going to sign up for that kind of welcome. im here for those in here that can speak zkp, sharding, and paychannels on low level with me. DM me. thank you and bye for now

&rey: ZK-proving entire blockchain uses quite a lot of resources, doesn't it? And it imposes cost on new TVM opcodes, which are in my opinion more important.

Cryptskii: wrong (reply to 79695)

Cryptskii: not in that design

Cuddlesaurus: I would like to learn more about TON.

Cuddlesaurus: about the future of TON

Cryptskii: use of epdemic communication and verification between shards and the constant sized storage means the work load per node does not increase in cost or complexity as it scales

Cryptskii: anyways i dont want to annoy you with my trailing thought  habits. keeping the chat well structured comes 1st! ofc

Cryptskii: ü´∂

&rey: Feel free to suggest things if you have idea how to integrate them with TON without hindering it much! Though modifying core isn't a simple thing, as I've seen in the code. (reply to 79694)

Cryptskii: I want an NDA before i share any of this to even the TON team. Im obsessed with studying the success of these point-fi games and see that 90% are literally just thrown together crap poorly though out and are still doing well lmao. a lot like 2017 how you could spin up an ERC-20 and a pipe dream w.p and have people jump all over it regardless. Hamster Kombat seems to be one of the only ones.  Hamster kombat seemingly has had a solid strategy that started the day after they named it lol. But honestly they know how to get the headcount in the least grindy way and are covering all their bases. If they can clutch things at airdrop i frimly belive they could build up to a amily known household name and likely accuire some massive partnerships. hamster are highly marketable it turns out. I like to be number #1 very much you see. Im taking things to the next level with our project. i can tell you right away 25-40% of the worlds pop already are interested in the narrative we are binging to TON with our game. The other great things is sets itself up for a stong LT apeal based on making fun factor and mass apeal prority which actually start with looking at the concept and asking and looking at it and asking "okay so this is working now, but how well will it work tomorrow. can i picture content writers being able to provide fresh and captivating campains for years like a hit TV show? Or will i be forced to go the multiverse route right away like fornite did so i dont run out a ways to keep my users attention and time fixed which 9/10 will just butcher it anyays.  I dont need the grant that bad. More intersted in a live ptich and demo or i can just wait. I want to get 40% of TGs users owning and using TON wallets

Cryptskii: thays my goal. therfore we are using a non crypto related design with consistant mass apeal since at least the 1800s üòÅ

slavagm: Is there any conditions to apply for GameFI grant? (reply to 79706)

Cryptskii: a form. and im a non conformist. you can put great ideas on a genralized template. thats insulting imo. i have a sucessful start up and exit already. And this is a simple game im having fun coding in js css etc, its like im laying down while driving compared to coding in haskell. we already have a story line for two seasons and alpa next week. this is a nice change in pace. i forgot what its like to be able to hit the nitrous button LFG!

Snow Lee: pinging this issue again (reply to 42482)

Snow Lee: because no one resolves it

Snow Lee: can't call getData() on Testnet

Tiep: The receiver must be named "TokenNotification" or can I custom this? Let's say the token user will deposit into contract is USDT. (reply to 79487)

&rey: Have you set HttpProvider url appropriately? (reply to 79794)

Snow Lee: yes, I've made sure to use the right apiKey and the testnet config (reply to 79796)

Snow Lee: TonClientURL=https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC this is the tonClientURL

Snow Lee: getData always throws an error

&rey: If exit code is -13, that may indicate that jetton wallet is not deployed (that there are 0 jettons). (reply to 79797)

&rey: You can customize that, however all jettons will be received in the same function. (reply to 79795)

Snow Lee: There are no exit code (reply to 79800)

Snow Lee: I've run the same example on mainnet, which works fine. but on Testnet the config just doesn't seems to work, and I noticed this issue has been replicated here multiple time

&rey: Courtesy of your framework, I assume. You can find exit code in the "network" browser console panel. (reply to 79803)

Aldo: where can i contact support

daniel: just wait for scammers to contact you again (reply to 79814)

Tiep: I see some customize examples, but I still wonder how contract can receive it. My understanding is that all Jettons implement a function called TokenTransfer. How it work ? (reply to 79802)

&rey: All TEP74-compliant jettons send a message of specific format to destination contract, if so requested by sender (forward amount > 0). It has opcode 0x7362d09c, which allows to identify incoming message as token transfer. (reply to 79818)

&rey: I don't think it makes much sense to talk about "implements" "function"; just whether contract processes messages of a specific structure as wanted.

Tiep: Hey got it ! Thank you again ! (reply to 79819)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Hey guys, maybe that's a dumb question lol but can you enlighten me a bit on one principle. Let's say that i want to deploy a new wallet. As far as i understand, addresses are generated according to some parameters like your smart contract code and its storage, which makes me think that you can't just get an address from a private key.  So if i want t deploy walletv4, i am supposed to fund the future address of that wallet before sending the deployment transaction, righth?

Joel Mun: Someone please help me.. I really want to deploy a contract on testnet so badly. How is everyone even testing with the faucet not working?? (reply to 79892)

Illia: FunC implementation of the Jetton Wallet does the following: hash(code, data) of the contract, and then sends a message to the destination address that transfers Jettons to the destination address from the sender's Jetton Wallet. If there is already a Jetton Wallet, then nothing happens and the transfer is triggered. However, if you don't have such a wallet deployed, i.e. you have 0 jettons, then this data and the code you sent will be used to deploy the contract first and only then to handle the transaction and increase the number of Jettons from 0 to how much you sent (reply to 79893)

wikig: Hello guys , during the using of telegram.js . is that possible to know the currently status of  isExpanded ? Is the isExpanded method ?

Illia: Firstly, you can write tests for your contracts with Blueprint and Sandbox. Then you can setup MyLocalTON and run a simple blockchain, but locally to test out your contracts via the locally hosted TON-HTTP-API. Finally, once you think that your contracts are ready to move forward, you can deploy them. The testgiver will be fixed very soon I believe (reply to 79895)

Vasiliy: Hello everyone. Please help me understand the commissions. When calculating the TON transfer fee, everything is clear and matches up, but when sending jettons (USDT), I can't understand where and why the fees are deducted. Example tx, hash: 4ebe63da62666c87c1bebd9c7853563fb1e79c1c01c6df1ec25e5416623d705f  External-In message: Total fee: 0.005545203  Internal message: Value: 0.01 Forward Fee: 0.000472537  Value flow (for the sender): Network Fee: 0.006414140 Balance change: -0.009363741  How can it be explained that 0.009363741 TON was deducted (when normally sending USDT)? I have checked all the parameters but cannot get this amount. As I understand it, the fee can be calculated as "Total fee" + "Forward Fee" = 0.005545203 + 0.000472537 = 0.00601774. And in the case of a regular TON transfer, this works, plus the Value (0.01) is also sent, but part of it should be returned as Excess.

Frank: Hi guys, I wondering how "burn address" works on TON.

Dmitriy: Hey guys! Could you please tell at which open-source dAapp that interacts with smart contracts I can take a look as a reference of informing user about success/failure of the transaction?

Frank: How do you know res contains ".ok"?  Maybe add try/catch surrounded your function in case client.sendMessage failed for another reason   I also recommend, adding test driven approach (using jest for example) and check what kind of return client.sendMessage could return (reply to 79940)

Frank: Exactly (reply to 79947)

Biobrain: I actually got it working through BotFather's setup process for /newapp and just ended up providing it an ngrok url. I wonder if it would be able to work with localhost (reply to 79949)

Dmitriy: The code snippet represents calling smart contracts in another blockchains where it‚Äôs possible to synchronously call the smart contract and get the result of transaction execution  In TON it‚Äôs not possible, so I‚Äôd like to take a look on the best practices how to do it (reply to 79948)

11: Is there an example of trans_tick_tock here?

}Marka{: Hi. I am writing a program in JS using TON Connect UI. I initiate a transaction when connecting a wallet and I would like to add a comment to this transaction, is this possible? I just can‚Äôt find it in the documentation

0x0liver: how can i understand raw_reserve function?

&rey: Testing? In mainnet, of course. Or in @ton/sandbox. (reply to 79895)

&rey: It requests certain portion of balance to remain on the contract. (reply to 79965)

0x0liver: do you have any tutorial other than docs? (reply to 79972)

&rey: Of which transaction, I'm sorry? For instance, jetton transfer consists of 3-5 transactions. It isn't simple to get success status of all of them... (reply to 79940)

&rey: Because no one can deploy contract on arbitrary address (unless they know its SHA256 preimage = initial state). (reply to 79937)

&rey: base64 and base64-urlsafe encodings. (reply to 79920)

&rey: It would make transaction inclusion more certain. Though it may still not be included by deadline in the signed message, in which case you will have to update the BOC. (reply to 79911)

Frank: Appreciate your answer, but not very clear to me, I was wondering if this address, once "no more suspended after 2027" will be able to move tokens as he want? xD (reply to 79977)

&rey: > addresses are generated according to some parameters like your smart contract code and its storage Yes.  > you can't just get an address from a private key You can't "just" get, yes. But that algorithm still can be run offchain.  > So if i want t deploy walletv4, i am supposed to fund the future address of that wallet before sending the deployment transaction, righth? Exactly. (reply to 79893)

Frank: pcrafter nice username haha! long life to craftmanships

&rey: After 2027 AND if someone finds contract code+data which make the address hash part match, then the code may get executed moving tokens around. (reply to 79981)

&rey: The latter part of problem is essentially mining, by the way.

Dmitriy: Yeah, it would be correct to call it _transaction tree_ or smth like that  I mean, I have a contract that performs logically a single action but in TON it‚Äôs represented by multiple transactions. I‚Äôd like to inform the caller of my contract about the fact that something went wrong (in case when the action is completed I send the log message), and I‚Äôm wondering how to do it correctly. One of the options is to send a message to sender with some comment contains the failure reason/error code (reply to 79975)

&rey: You mean, @ton/ton? It also has same function. (reply to 80015)

Prince: yes, javascript sdk, @ton/ton

&rey: I prefer to let users deploy their own contracts. Though, if automatic deploy is needed, then I'd use pytoniq backed by wallet with some TON deposited in advance. (reply to 80014)

Prince: suppose I develop wallet connect with only ton.js then only I can do is use mnemonic?

AG: thanks, currently i only saw one kind of jetton (reply to 80047)

&rey: What do you mean by "one kind of jetton"? (reply to 80066)

AG: i mean is there one standard being used for all tokens or its customizable like on solana there is one spl program on which all tokens gets deployed and all tokens are same (reply to 80087)

&rey: TEP-74 is a common standard that says what "jetton" is, but it is flexible enough... for instance, it doesn't say whether all jetton balances must be positive...  And sure enough most projects have their own implementations. (reply to 80088)

Frank: I'm checking on previous messages but didn't saw anyone sharing sort of JavaScript demo on how to decode in_msg body from a transaction using example of TL-B / base64 formating. I'm interesting if there is such example.

Stephan: Hello, please tell me, is it safe to launch a project in production whose smart contracts were written in Tact and not in Func? It's just that TON warns that the language is created by the community and you need to be more careful

WH: Ya usually those are the signs. I think i'll need to use some simulations to test jettons in general

WH: Ya true but some promise but never do anything

:D: hi, i believe its due to the response_destination being set as your address (reply to 80172)

GygaCode: Taking as a reference that I had 5 contracts, of which one is to receive the initial message and then start a chain of messages between the 5 contracts, until a final solution is reached, all these messages and executions could be carried out in the same block? I know that the asynchronous nature of the blockchain does not require this to be the case, but my question is more based on time, from the point of view of user experience.

There is a Cell in which the information for sale is supposedly passed. According to the getgems marketplace code, the first item should be the operation code (uint32, equal to 1), but then I get stuck. There are 512 bits read as a signature. How do I form it? Then another 2 refs, state_init and body, are read. It‚Äôs also unclear how to form them. Is there any workaround for listing an NFT on the marketplace?

beck_: Can somebody from admin/team help me with these Qs; 1. How much TON do the TON team, foundation, and ecosystem funds currently hold? Where can I check the complete contract addresses for them?  2. What is the source of the 0.6% TON yearly inflation? Is this supply from the initial 500 million mining allocation or new inflation (after 500 million) from the contract?  3. Are there any updated resources to check TON tokenomics? Earlier, there was freezing for inactive wallets holding TON, making it difficult to identify clear token supply information for TON.  4. Is the number of TON validators limited? Is there a maximum limit for the validator count, or can anyone join the TON validator list at any time?  5. Is Redstone the only Oracle TON is using?  6. In March 2024, Telegram announced that it would share 50% of ad revenue with channel owners and that the payments would be settled on the TON blockchain. What is the status (implemented / still pending) of this information?  7. Where can I check voting proposals for TON? I couldn't find any latest proposal info on TON Vote.  8. Have Dynamic sharding (shardchains and workchains) already been implemented (mainnet or testnet)? If so, are there any examples, or are they just a proof-of-concept at the moment?

&rey: 2. New TON are minted each block (1/1.7 TON per block). It increases total supply. It's worth noting that half of fees are burned, decreasing total supply. There is no attempt to explicitly balance those.  4. At the moment, the main limit is that Elector smart contract needs to evaluate full candidates list within special gas limit. I believe the limit is around 700 nodes. 5. No. 6. To be asked of Telegram/Fragment.  8. Yes, automatic sharding is online. "Shardchain blocks" on https://tonscan.org/block/latest. (reply to 80966)

Pegu: Like sending the message from wallet to the jetton wallet to initiate the transfer. I'm trying to do emulation from sandbox mainnet but the blockchain only accepts a message (reply to 80853)

&rey: You may need to push transaction into its underlying queue, but it should work. (reply to 81437)

mohsen: Can a TON wallet be deployed before receiving anything? (reply to 81444)

Pegu: how i'm emulating jetton transfer is opening up the jetton contract via the sandbox blockchain and using it to transfer. (Requires user mnemonic for sender, so i only can test emulation on my own wallet)  the mainnet blockchain emulation takes in internal messages only e.g.     const result = await blockchain.sendMessage(message);  messages = internal({      from: sender.address,      to: address,      value: toNano('1'),      body: beginCell().storeUint(0, 32).endCell()  I was thinking of crafting the internal message to trigger the jetton transfer? (Not sure if possible)  or is there another method of doing this emulation of public user address (reply to 81444)

&rey: There may be other (possibly private) fields on blockchain which can help with emulation. Or a flag somewhere that disables signature checking; then you can send external to user's wallet to emulate that directly. (reply to 81448)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: I'm pretty noob on Ton but i guess that if you call the getter get_wallet_data on your jetton wallet address you should get what you need (reply to 81582)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: That's for USDT (or any other jetton) not for Native Ton (reply to 81585)

Paul: it seems easy, but which lib? üòÅ ton-connect? or ton-web or something else? (reply to 81585)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: I'm pretty much using only https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/ton for everything, but i guess you can choose any lib you prefer as they are probably already using this one (or use this one straight) (reply to 81589)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Or actually you can just do an http call on the API like they do on tonviewer front-end

Daryl: Hey guys, I am a wallet developer. I am having an issue where TonCenter API's getTransactions shows a transaction as success while it actually failed. When I check TONViewer, it shows correctly that the transaction failed but not for tonscan. Is this a bug?

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: That's probably on the TonCencer side, i faced a lot of similar issues with EVM explorers, where their scrappers got a wrong info in their DB. (reply to 81595)

charlie: Hi team, is there any api or go sdk to convert the hash format or address format? thanks a lot

Daryl: I have tried tonconsole as well and it is the same thing. The weird thing is Tonscan also shows as success (reply to 81596)

Daryl: Is there an effective way to check whether a transaction has in fact success or fail? because the current way of using the api from toncenter seems to be not reliable

charlie: I found the response format is really different between TonCenter side and Tonconsole side. (reply to 81597)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: The most trustworthy data gotta be the blockchain itself (reply to 81600)

charlie: you can query transaction detail on Tonconsole side. it's real tx status on chain. (reply to 81600)

Daryl: I have tried using this api from tonconsole, it still shows as success despite transaction failing (reply to 81606)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: I'm a noob on Ton also, but i guess that you can use the "getTransaction" method on the ton client to get some more details about this TX from a node (reply to 81609)

Ruslan: You should check the "description.aborted = false". (reply to 82134)

Alfred: When a contract received a TransferNotification, how can we verify that it sends from a desired JettonMaster contract?

Raf: yes thanks, I just added a "10.000 transfers" test suite today, I discovered that sometimes when you send 12 , only 11 are received by the receiver, this happens like one time out of 100 (reply to 81898)

Raf: maybe it's a bug at protocol level, maybe it's known

Rayan: but this transaction is failed on Ton Viewer. (reply to 82136)

Rayan: how is that possible?

Rayan: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/20342613a67f5eb438cfab415fc2ff617d19dd7cb6019436d464bfcf16c80f81

Ruslan: Tonviewer operates in terms of the events and actions. You can find there that action "transfer token" was failed. Nevertheless, this is not "failed" in terms of blockchain

Samyar: hi there, does anyone know when i edit my metadata content of an nft (name and image) how long it takes to getgems get updated?   it looks it has cached the nft metadata

Samyar: when i press refresh metadata it still reads the cached result

Pedro|üí≤üîì: /nIQMd7NKyM

Rayan: how did you find out that transfer token is failed from this? : https://t.me/tondev_eng/82134  and does this mean that token is not transfered? if its not transfered i assume that a failed transaction. now how can i find out its failed from that info? (reply to 82147)

Ruslan: There is no way to understand it from this response. From tonviewer you can find, that you should check transaction F in the graph, meanwhile the one you've shared is B.  Transaction B was completed successfully, and both toncenter and tonviewer says that. (reply to 82153)

Samaun: Hi

Key: I'm developing a telegram miniapp game, I want to check if users have followed twitter, watched youtube videos, in the task section to receive rewards. Can anyone give me the documentation link for that

&: Do not fear about Tonviewer.com 's fail msg. I have tried to fix normal jetton transfer to control it , and ton viewer told me "fail" but actually jetton is successfuly transferred.

Rayan: Aha, is there any hash for all of a batch transaction which its response contain both B & F transactions? (reply to 82155)

Kat: Hey folks, sorry this may not be the technical question. Wonder if there is any channel for project ecosystem on Ton? Would like to get connected with Ton projects.

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Has any of you been able to locate your own tx in the mempool websocket provided by tonconsole? I've been running like maybe 10 tests and not a single time i was able to find my own TX in the mempool, even though the transaction has been made while the websocket was sending me transactions, i even kept it open several minutes after and the transaction just never came

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Actually i understood, i was doing tests by swapping with Crypton bot, but it seems these dudes don't use a public mempool. If i do a swap on DeDust itself i see the tx straight (reply to 82168)

K: for dex swapping which one you prefer? dedust or ston.fi? (reply to 82176)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: dedust (reply to 82178)

K: is there a way I deploy jetton contract which another master contract?

K: with* sorry

K: or could jetton master contract hold other jetton coins?

Misurio: Gentlemen, tell me, is there any way I can change the logo after transferring the ownership of the token to Ton? I wanted to tweak it a bit. I saw that utyab changed the logo, but I'm not sure if that was after the ownership transfer or not.

User<6776655683>: /nIQMd7NKyM

K.: If your jetton icon is hosted somewhere you control, you can just change the image and that will change the logo. Commonly people use GitHub or their own website to host the image so it can be changed. (reply to 82183)

K: I don't think there has way to do so (reply to 82183)

K: thats an idea! (reply to 82191)

K.: But if it's hosted somewhere outside of your reach and you have already revoked token admin - then, sadly, it's not possible. (reply to 82191)

Misurio: ahhh i see (reply to 82191)

Misurio: ok thank you for respond !

WinK: Telegram mini apps like Notcoin, tapswap   Allows users to tap and earn reward points and be able to mint them on their own.  How is this possible? Even people without doing the tap task can mint tokens as the function is public ?   How this issue is solved in Notcoin?

&rey: Server does or at least signs the mint. (reply to 82199)

WinK: Is there any example or documentation that I can refer into?

Nerses: Suppose i have smart contract for doing HTLC and user1 wants to do swap of Jetton with user2. when user1 locks his Jetton funds in HTLC smart contract,Jetton wallet will be created for HTLC contarct after it how HTLC smart contract should calculate the Jetton wallet address of user2 to do transfer ? if Jetton wallet for user 2 doesnt exist  what will be done ?

Victor: https://faucet.tonfura.com/

Victor: just found a site that gives free test tons every 12 hrs (reply to 82228)

&rey: No, only jetton wallet address of HTLC. (reply to 82223)

&rey: There is ECVRF, https://ratingers.pythonanywhere.com/ecvrf-about.html. Its backing contract can be checked at https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ecvrf-coordinator-contract/blob/master/src/coordinator.fc. (reply to 82215)

&rey: Have you tried searching in this chat? Open developers menu in Tonkeeper. Close it. Add new wallet, there will be option about testnet. (reply to 82211)

Nerses: then what address should i specify to transfer user2 ? If I got right it should be user2 ordinary address and under the hood transfer will be done to user2 Jetton wallet if it exists (reply to 82233)

don: thanks. is there any telegram mini app using this under the hood? i would like to see it in action (reply to 82234)

&rey: Unfortunately there isn't. (reply to 82238)

don: hmm. i wonder how safe it is to use (reply to 82239)

don: really would like to build out this TMA, but not having basic stuff like Chainlink VRF or something similar that is safe/standard is limiting

&rey: Its entropy backing is mathematical, instead of DAO. The only issue I can imagine is if server somehow goes offline. That's possible but not very likely. (reply to 82241)

&rey: No one had the need, possibly. (reply to 82242)

don: can you elaborate? wdym server? (reply to 82243)

don: its a very simple idea, but like it can be extrapolated to many many things (reply to 82244)

&rey: Server = oracle = the party which generates provably unpredictable data (random) in response to the challenge in coordinator contract. (reply to 82245)

don: i see. (reply to 82247)

don: im gonna try and build a proof of concept that emulates a dice roll (random value 1-6)

don: this thing you linked, should suffice right?

Nerses: in case user 2 doesnt have Jetton wallet,how will be deployment of Jetton wallet for him ? (reply to 82233)

zeligmann: What's mean code 9 in transaction?

Nerses: https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-exit-codes#:~:text=Cell%20underflow.%20Read%20from%20slice%20primitive%20tried%20to%20read%20more%20bits%20or%20references%20than%20there%20are. (reply to 82255)

&rey: Jetton wallet of HTLC will do so automatically. (reply to 82253)

Nerses: and there is no need HTLC contract to be master contract for being abel to deploy ? (reply to 82258)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Is there a way to destroy some of my jetton accounts to get back the Ton in their balance? I have almost a hundred of them and they all have some positive balance between 20 and 80 cents

don: so if i were building a TMA, it wouldn‚Äôt be possible to add this directly to my smart contract right? it‚Äôd need to be handled/implemented on the app side? client/server (reply to 82247)

&rey: Your TMA doesn't need a server, there is one attached to that specific coordinator contract which is on "about" page. (reply to 82262)

&rey: Unfortunately there isn't. (reply to 82261)

Degen: Hi guys! Are there any TON dev support? Can we start private conversation? I have few questions

User<7376766125>: Say here you will be answer here (reply to 82269)

Degen: It is possible to get "shadow ban" with ton connect? I deployed one ton application and everything works quite well but then there is no possibility to connect wallet on main domain. If we switch domain to different or to localhost there is no problem with ton wallet connecting.

musashi: did you try vpn? (reply to 82273)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Damn that's actually pretty stupid lol, is it intentional or? (reply to 82265)

musashi: Ton has a storage fee mechanism (reply to 82276)

musashi: I guess that is the reason

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Yeah but if i wanna destroy this smart contract it does not need to be stored anymore and i should be able to destroy it and get its balance, just like SOL does (reply to 82277)

Degen: My users won't try VPN. Just our app on main domain doesn't ton connect, but with localhost and different domains there is no problem of connecting and we can't solve it. Shadow ban is the thing I have to check with ton support (reply to 82275)

musashi: I didn't get this issue before, just want to know that was the IP address related to Ton Connect service (reply to 82281)

&rey: Those jetton implementations weren't well thought out. In particular, they don't make use of 0.1 TON credit for storage (contract isn't frozen until its balance reaches -0.1 TON). (reply to 82276)

User<7376766125>: Where do you host (reply to 82281)

Degen: notpump dot fun => here you can't login but with funton dot degen dot pl you can login. You can test it, we get decode error on production but only there. Localhost and different domains works (reply to 82282)

Nerses: does every Jetton able to accept identically same message like this message(0x0f8a7ea5) JettonTransfer {     query_id: Int as uint64;                // arbitrary request number     amount: Int as coins;                   // amount of jettons to transfer     destination: Address;                   // address of the new owner of the jettons     response_destination: Address;          // address where to send a response with confirmation of a successful transfer and the rest of the incoming message Toncoins.     custom_payload: Cell?;                  // optional custom payload     forward_ton_amount: Int as coins;       // the amount of nanotons to be sent to the destination address.     forward_payload: Slice as remaining;    // optional custom data that should be sent to the destination address. }     ?

musashi: yes, if that jetton contract follow TEP-74 standard (reply to 82288)

eo: Hi. I am wondering if its possible to fork mainnet when testing? I specifically want to use USDT jettons in my forked environment, wondering how I could do this and prank the message sender to send from an arbitrary address (whale) ?

musashi: why you need to use the exact USDT on mainnet mate? you can deploy your own test jetton (reply to 82303)

Nerses: can you please provide any link just couldnt find. I reasearched the Jetton standart in Ton dynasty repo and there wasnt what i wanted(or just couldnt find) (reply to 82302)

&rey: No. (reply to 82259)

musashi: thanks sir

eo: thanks this is great.  is it possible to spoof a sender? (reply to 82315)

&rey: Let me check. (reply to 82318)

&rey: I think you can, using let spoofed = blockchain.sender(addr);

Study Labs Dev Team: Good afternoon, tell me, is there any get method or function in the tone libraries that outputs the number or addresses of the nft on the wallet?

Rayan: Guys, Which one of TonViewer and TonScan is better. i have a transaction, TonViewer says its failed, TonScan says its confirmed and TonCenter is like TonScan. Which one is true? and is there another explorer for Ton?

musashi: they are all correct mate (reply to 82351)

Rayan: Another question is that does Ton support batch transaction?  https://tonviewer.com/transaction/ca17464fd9e0200a8848776b36ea9ccb6b26c087bb60b2598e0f699d3169e30d this transaction looks batched, but when you search it on TonScan its one only and each of these transactions has a page for itself. can someone explain it?

Rayan: so why are they different? (reply to 82353)

musashi: actually they are multiple messages (reply to 82354)

musashi: each message can be failed or success

Rayan: Did you open the link? so those 5 transfers are called message?  so why each of them has its in or external messages too? I am new to Ton guys. If you use example each concept in EVM i understand better. (reply to 82356)

musashi: like this one, the third message failed, but other 4 messages was success

Rayan: hash of that message is successful in TonScan. (reply to 82361)

musashi: on EVM chains, you can make external calls to other contracts, if one of them failed, the whole will be reverted, but on Ton the messages are independent and be processed parallely (reply to 82360)

cosdy: online especially

&rey: Because they define success differently. No explorer can know what user intended to do; Tonscan shows whether contract computation or action phase raised error, Tonviewer likely shows whether the operation indicated by opcode succeeded. (reply to 82355)

&rey: Those rows don't correspond one-to-one to transactions=messages. Please open Transactions tree to see list of messages. (reply to 82359)

Rayan: these rows are transactions or messages? (reply to 82368)

&rey: neither, it's just record of the changes interesting to users.  Modulo special cases, each TON transaction corresponds to one message, which it processes. So when everything is processed (no messages remaining in queues) transaction count is equal to message count. (reply to 82369)

Rayan: so this is all one transaction with few messages? (reply to 82372)

musashi: here mate (reply to 82372)

Rayan: explain please. I dont understand message and transaction concepts. what are transactions and messages on this: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/ca17464fd9e0200a8848776b36ea9ccb6b26c087bb60b2598e0f699d3169e30d

musashi: each line (A -> B), (B -> C), etc is a transaction (also a message)

Rayan: sorry, i didnt see this. (reply to 82372)

Rayan: so what is the line between? why are them connected? (reply to 82378)

musashi: the line A -> B means A sends a message to B

Diana: Hi! Is it possible to integrate tonconnect for jetton transfers?

Tom: Hello guys. Is there any way to speed up transaction confirmation on chain?

Rayan: Aha, so TonScan has a page for each of these lines while Tonviewer shows the graph? and when graph ends? its about time or if F sends message to G graph would continue? (reply to 82381)

&rey: Messages: - external to A (signed request to send a message from the wallet) - A to B, carries 0.185 TON (request to transfer jettons) - B to C, carries 0.177 TON (jetton's internal move) - C to A, carries 0.037 TON (excess TON return) - C to D, carries 0.125 TON (jetton deposit notification, carries request to perform swap) - D to E, carries 0.119 TON (Stonfi's swap request) - E to D, carries 0.054 TON (Stonfi's payout request, likely ref) - E to D, carries 0.054 TON (Stonfi's payout request) - D to F, carries 0.048 TON (request to transfer pseudo-jettons, likely ref) - D to F, carries 0.048 TON (request to transfer pseudo-jettons) - F to G, carries 0.049 TON (payout, likely ref) - F to A, carries 4.207 TON (payout) (reply to 82376)

Rayan: These values contain fees too? or just amount transfered? (reply to 82386)

&rey: Graph ends when transactions in it no longer have outgoing messages. (Tonviewer emulates whole graph ahead of time) (reply to 82385)

musashi: depends on the send mode of the message (reply to 82387)

Rayan: Thanks brothers.

Alfred: I don't have them. Just an idea to implement it. (reply to 82346)

NPA120: which language do you use? if python, you can use this code. `photo_file = update.message.photo[-1].get_file()     if photo_file:         photo_url = photo_file.file_id` (reply to 82410)

Dmitriy: Hi! I‚Äôm curious how the transaction F here is marked as failed in tonviewer despite the fact that it has success: true and aborted: false ?

Dmitriy: I mean this link For some reason it doesn‚Äôt allow forwards in ths chat :\ (reply to 82376)

&rey: It's swap which cannot afford to fail transaction on blockchain level (or assets would be lost), but it has nonzero "exit" code in outgoing messages. (reply to 82418)

Dmitriy: But looking at the graph, all the messages here have 0 exit code (reply to 82421)

&rey: I mean this (reply to 82422)

Dmitriy: So this exit code isn‚Äôt a part of message layout and just kinda convention, right?

Dmitriy: I mean, it‚Äôs not a part of any standard, and tonviewer uses the exit_code field in the message to recognize the failure?

Dmitriy: I‚Äôve noticed that I didn‚Äôt reply you in the messages above so doing it just in case so you won‚Äôt miss the answer Really want to figure out how it‚Äôs done (reply to 82423)

&rey: Yes. More precisely, Tonviewer recognizes that message conforms to Stonfi's formats and uses that to load certain bits to get exit_code. (Message isn't a JSON object, after all...) (reply to 82425)

Dmitriy: Got it, thank you  Is it applicable only for stonfi contracts (i.e. stonfi and toncenter devs agreed on it), or this exit_code convention can be applied to any other contract too? I understand that I can try it myself, but maybe it‚Äôs already known  I assume the former, but who knows (reply to 82429)

&rey: Only Tonapi developers know. (reply to 82430)

Dmitriy: Got it, thanks (reply to 82431)

Dmitriy: One more question: I see that transaction D -> F has zero forward_ton_amount but there is also F -> G which is a transfer notification Shouldn‚Äôt the forward_ton_amount be greater than 0 to make transfer_notification to be sent?

&rey: F seems to be a pseudo-jetton-wallet ‚Äî TON vault with interface of a wallet. (reply to 82433)

Dmitriy: I see, thanks (reply to 82434)

Alexander: Hi! Can we send a request to send more than one internal message via TON Connect?

Thomas: GM! Can I send an external message to the contract with an specific TON amount attached?

&rey: Yes. Up to 4 messages; 1-3 certainly work fine. (reply to 82595)

&rey: Look at Stonfi's contracts and see how they deserialize the swap request (or at TL-B, which is more formal description of same). Look at Dedust's contracts and do same. For less known exchanges, you won't be able to parse but you won't notice many transactions at them either. (reply to 82561)

&rey: More common way is to write it as begin_cell().store_uint(6, 5).store_ref(jetton_wallet_code).store_ref(...data).end_cell(), but those ways are equivalent.  store_dict is same as store_maybe_ref ‚Äî adds single 1 bit and a reference. (reply to 82786)

Rayan: guys what does this mean in tx info? "type": "ord"  i also see type: Internal and external? which one is more relevant in Ton society for tx type? and internal means just Ton transfer and external means smart contract call, right?

&rey: No. External message is one sent from outside of blockchain, paid by contract's funds. Internal is most common. (reply to 82822)

Rayan: is every message that has out_msgs, external? is this true? (reply to 82823)

musashi: external - message from outside of the blockchain internal - message from contract to contract (inside the blockchain) (reply to 82824)

musashi: out_msgs means the messages sent from that contract to other contracts and still internal messages

Abdulaziz: @co_durov check DM

beck_: Can somebody from the admin/team help me with these Qs here;  Few have already replied but few new others too;  1. In how much time duration staking rewards are distributed to the validator? Is it based on a validation round? If so, how long in the validation round period?  2. If Redstone isn't the only Oracle used for TON, why there's no details about other Oracle in TON docs?   3. Is dynamic sharding just integration on core TON blockchain architecture or using dynamic sharding other protocol could also be build on top of TON? (reply to 80966)

Davo: Hello

Davo: Hello. I've been racking my brain but can't figure this out... I have deployed a jetton contract with off-chain content. It's an IPFS uri. Tonscan recognizes the content fine EQBOYDDpytUpWKkdU3QFY5wlPcipDX4QjQ1k9dG29Xb8_Zr8 but tonviewer doesn't and instead shows "Unknown Token" with placeholder metadata.

Davo: I would appreciate someone's help. I must've done something wrong though the content is simply a ref to a cell that has 0x01 as the first 8 bits, then an ascii-encoded URI string.

Illia: What's algorithm used for hashing cells and slices?  HASHCU & HASHSU  Is it not sha256 as for SHA256U by default?

Adam: using the js sdk, how can i find all jettons owned by an address?

&rey: Using which SDK, actually? You have to query tonapi.io or dton.io/graphql, and neither of these requires SDK. (reply to 82939)

Adam: the official from @ton-core

Adam: but there must be a way to do it directly on the blockchain as well no? (reply to 82940)

&rey: Blockchain doesn't store "all jettons owned by an address" in single place so it's resource-intensive. (reply to 82942)

Pegu: Unfortunately not, its one of the transaction that occur in between transactions (reply to 82965)

Dmitriy: Hi!  Is it right that the first element of parse_std_addr(my_address()) may be different depending on the shardchain at which the contract is located at the moment?  If so, is it right that it‚Äôs better to use the second element of tuple returned by parse_std_addr i.e. account_id ?

&rey: 1. No. 2. What? (reply to 82983)

Dmitriy: The 2nd question was implied by the fact that the answer on the 1st one is yes, but it seems that it‚Äôs no longer relevant  I mean, if the workchain_id is variable thing, it‚Äôs better to use the constant part to compare the addresses (e.g. compare if the message sender is a contract admin, etc.) (reply to 82984)

Dmitriy: Thank you, btw!

musashi: I wonder to know why people learn Tact instead of jump directly into FunC - the 'main' language with rich documentation and bigger community =)

musashi: it's a bit difficult at first but I think FunC holds the idea of Ton sharding

Nerses: For example I choose Tact as I am new in this field and it is much more easy to write code in tact than func.although after 2 months func is also ok (reply to 83166)

UwU‚Ä¢JJ: Hi, I'm new to TON dev. I encounter something and try to figure this out, can anyone help me?  > What exactly is a WalletStateInit that you retrive when connect your wallet to TonConnect?

&rey: It is (initial) code and data of user's wallet contract, uniquely determining the address. It can be used for obtaining user's public key or deploying user's wallet during TON transfer *to* it. (reply to 83499)

UwU‚Ä¢JJ: As I understood, given the stateInit, you could retrieve {'hashed_address', 'pub_key'} from wallet contract, right?  Then is it possible if the attacker trying to tamper the stateInit so that the hashed_address & pub_key refer to different account?

UwU‚Ä¢JJ: @pcrafter the above would be possible only if you could break the cryptographic hash function right? im not sure if I follow up my idea in the right way.

&rey: Yes, or if backend neglects to check if StateInit matches the address. (reply to 83504)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Is it possible to make it so that when buying a shitcoin, i deploy my own version of the jetton-wallet instead of the common one which does not allow the owner to destroy it after usage?

Freed: Nope, all jetton wallets must have the same code, otherwise they won't be connected to the same jetton.  You can create wrap wallet for someone's jetton but they will store wraps, and not original jettons which won't help you avoid owner (reply to 83522)

–û—Ä–µ–ª—å–∞–Ω [NEVER DM FIRST]: Hey thanks for the answer, is it really a bytecode level issue or if both interfaces are fully compatible that might be ok? (reply to 83525)

Freed: Jetton has a function to find a wallet address by knowing it's bytecode and init (usually jetton address and address of owner). If you change anything in bytecode, jetton and it's jetton wallets won't work with them as their own (reply to 83527)

Carterüßπ: Hi guys, I'm trying to deserialize Block data, and am having trouble with BlockExtra.  According to the TL-B, it should only be 513 bits wide, two 32byte hashes, and a Maybe flag. However my Cell from the network (a Workchain block) is 548 bits wide, 35 bits extra (or one uint32 and change).  Is the TL-B definition for BlockExtra in Git not correct? If I ignore these extra bits, and take the Maybe from the end of the two hashes as described, I get an instruction to deserialize McBlockExtra, but I don't have enough Refs on the Cell to do this, only 3 which are consumed by the first 3 pointers.  block_extra in_msg_descr:^InMsgDescr   out_msg_descr:^OutMsgDescr   account_blocks:^ShardAccountBlocks   rand_seed:bits256   created_by:bits256   custom:(Maybe ^McBlockExtra) = BlockExtra;

Carterüßπ: In the documentation, it has an old (different) definition for BlockExtra, so I assume something is out of date here, and it could be the .tlb on Git?

&rey: First, you've forgotten about auto-tag. It's equal to b'J3\xf6\xfd'. (reply to 83751)

Carterüßπ: Oh shit, usually they are defined in the TL-B! So this is 32 bits wide? Your encoding is odd in the TG message.

&rey: Second, maybe cell is 545 bits long? I've found tag in https://github.com/yungwine/pytoniq-core/blob/master/pytoniq_core/tlb/block.py.

Carterüßπ: Thanks for your help on this, can't belive I got all the way through the block and failed on this hurdle üòÇ

Abdulaziz: There is a lot methods of creating wallet (reply to 83868)

John: Help please

Agent B: testnet? (reply to 83865)

Agent B: thank god, thought it was just me

Abdulaziz: Yes (reply to 83873)

Agent B: That's a releif

MZ: What is the easiest way to listen for TON transactions? On EVM I usually use Alchemy webhooks where they listen for incoming transactions on a given wallet and send information to my API that such transcation occured.   Do you know similar listening service on TON Network? If not - do you have any useful links/examples, where I can find information about listening transactions?

Abdulaziz: I lost my ton but another wallet didn't receive: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/0a9aefe252965684526f8febf1e7c3da5c8a98241db512994858deb23371218d

Abdulaziz: still pending

Abdulaziz: how to fix that problem

Luca: Hi I'm just learning about ton and I'm a bit confused about how a wallet address is supposed to be derived from an ed25519 key pair? Does anyone have a code snippet or a link to the spec of how it should be done?

Alexander: In TON there‚Äôs no direct connection between an ed25519 key pair and the address itself. Address is a sha256 cell hash of a state init (that contains code and data of a particular smart contract). And the data may contain a public key, or may not - as the developer wishes and anywhere in such data cell (reply to 83898)

Luca: Sorry.. so you are saying even if you have your mnemonic/private key you can‚Äôt compute your public address? (reply to 83899)

Luca: Oh I see wallets are all smart contracts on ton. So if you have a 24 word mnemonic you could have multiple addresses depending on the wallet version?

Abdulaziz: One 24 word equals to one wallet, wydm (reply to 83902)

Luca: https://tonhelloworld dot com/01-wallet/  Step 5  It looks like it‚Äôs possible to derive an address for a version of a wallet offline in step 7. Would anyone have code or pseudocode of how to do that without the ton sdk?

Abdulaziz: BRUH TRYING TO STEAL MY TONS FROM TESTNET LOLLüíÄ (reply to 83894)

Abdulaziz: How stupid is he? Maybe we can tell him that ton on the testnet is free (reply to 83909)

Abdulaziz: He must be so stupid, he is trying to deceive a developer who knows better than him, and he is trying to steal the tone from the testnet where everything is free. It's my fault that I wasted my precious time on that s–æn of –∞ bit—Åh. (reply to 83910)

Luca: Hmm I see this is a lot more complicated than other chains @agapak   https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-offline-transaction

Alexander: Looks a bit too old repo, look at https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/addresses (reply to 83914)

Luca: Yeah saw that too. It's older but it actually explains the flow of how it could possibly be computed offline (reply to 83915)

Alexander: Yes, you beed the smart contract code and other stuff. And you even can build a wallet that will not have a public key inside at all (reply to 83900)

Abdulaziz: There is some API for wallet.ton.org?

Alexander: Most of the sdk/libs can compute this offline (reply to 83917)

Alexander: It‚Äôs a non custodial wallet, as I know. You can build the same functionality using any SDK for TON (reply to 83919)

Abdulaziz: So i can create a clear wallet address using any ton sdk? (reply to 83921)

Alexander: I don‚Äôt know what do you mean by ‚Äúclear‚Äù, but yes you can do it with the most of SDKs (reply to 83922)

Alexander: https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/apis/sdk (reply to 83922)

Abdulaziz: The wallet which has no contract, and i can choose one, when i use something like @wallet it chooses the contract automatically (reply to 83923)

Lucky: Hi guys, can I get jetton balance using smart contract? is that possible?

Abdulaziz: I just wanna create a high loaded wallet (reply to 83923)

Alexander: No, you need to handle jetton transfers in your smart contract and update the balance inside it (reply to 83927)

Alexander: Go to any of the SDK and search for examples with this type of wallet (reply to 83928)

Luca: Alright I'll take another look at the sdks. I'm basically trying to figure out if I can get ton to work with a wallet service called turnkey which stores the private key in a secure enclave and gives you a public key (which I wanted to use to derive an address with) and the ability to send payloads to be signed to it. Maybe not feasible on ton? (reply to 83920)

Abdulaziz: It says i can build ton with PHP, this is the language I need (reply to 83924)

Alexander: Yes, you even can build ton with the binary code - why not üòÄ (reply to 83935)

&rey: What do you mean? (reply to 84016)

0xJack: ok

MZ: That's exactly what I would like to do, but I'm not sure if I can listen in Next.js app directly.  It would be the best if there were any service that listen for me and send information to my API when transaction on blockchain has been completed. Do you know something like this?

Short: Hi. I'm trying to understand if it's possible to host my Telegram web-app on an .adnl-domain name.   I've followed the guide and hosted the website & rldp-http-proxy. I checked with curl using one of public http-to-adnl proxy servers (curl -x ...) and I can clearly see my page & the request in the server access logs, however when I attach link to bot menu and try to open that link from bot menu - it shows error that domain cannot be resolved.   UPD: actually I'm not seeing requests though the proxy in the nginx logs, so I wonder where does the page comes from. Also any request to any sub-path gives the page at the root  UPD2: I fixed proxy command and now I see requests in nginx logs when accessing adnl domain, but it's still not working from Telegram

Frank: If anyone got that answer let me know, I really don't get it, I mean how does Cell format must be parsed for a given jetton master address.

Steven1 PAWS üêæü¶â üêà‚Äç‚¨õüçÖü¶â: I received toncoin but is not active on my wallet

Super_hands: Maybe too early check or wrong receiver address. Checked all? (reply to 84421)

&rey: Identical. Traditional way uses 3 stores into builder, and common one = 4 stores. Fees in the method are greater proportionally. (reply to 84420)

Super_hands: Hmm, so both are working identically but traditional way is cheaper. Then what are pros of using store_dict? (reply to 84423)

Steven1 PAWS üêæü¶â üêà‚Äç‚¨õüçÖü¶â: Please help to fix it

&rey: I don't know, just someone has written code in that way and it got into public. (reply to 84425)

Steven1 PAWS üêæü¶â üêà‚Äç‚¨õüçÖü¶â: But how can I fix it

spencer: hi, im attempting to get information about StoneFi swap transactions in a given block. here is my current control flow (using pytoniq btw):  block: BlockIdExt = await self.client.lookup_block(workchain_id, shard, seqno) ext_transactions = await self.client.raw_get_block_transactions_ext(block=block[0])  then im iterating through the transactions and looking for 0f8a7ea5 (jetton transfer opcode). im able to pinpoint the transactions im looking for, but im having trouble getting information about the swap itself (token address, amount token, amount TON swapped, etc). is it possible to get this information from the transaction itself, or am i going about this the wrong way? i noticed that the jetton transfer opcode is included in the transaction's out_msgs body, which is a Cell. maybe i need to deserialize the Cell to get the information i need? attached the Cell structure below as well if it helps. any input appreciated!  720[0F8A7EA5000000186598EEF96034F815DAE20800EF3B9902A271B2A01C8938A523CFE24E71847AAEB6A620001ED44A77AC0E709D0037EF56FA125FF70327F2F7F19DA19210377E2B5908F5B5595F66C3A09C35B22B080EE6B281] -> {         878[2593856180022A16A3164C4D5AA3133F3110FF10496E00CA8AC8ABEFFC5027E024D33480C3EA03601D2FE3001F5A5370F91065195BFB19605743CFDFB1BE26359614DFC44F99AA85F9CBF9EAF0037EF56FA125FF70327F2F7F19DA19210377E2B5908F5B5595F66C3A09C35B22B0] }

&rey: You can decode forward payload of jetton transfer, yes. Though I don't know its TLB... (reply to 84459)

Vladislav: I just gave an example of how this problem is solved for svelte, since I use it. But if you have react or something else, you will not have this config, of course  Here is information about what this flag does https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#csrf (reply to 84456)

spencer: so that out_msg payload would correspond to this information? (reply to 84460)

&rey: Yes. Please remember that the only certain guarantee that swap will have occured is, well, jettons arriving at destination wallet after swap. (reply to 84464)

spencer: ok great. really dont know where to start in regards to deserializing cells, should i start on Ton's BOC docs?

Guillaume: it should be on my side then, I just wanted to check if the API was down before I started investigating (reply to 84704)

Ruslan: sendBoc can be called only as POST method. If you check it in browser then you get 500. Call toncenter.com/api/v2/getMasterchainInfo is better way to check the api outage. Or just take a look at tonstat.us (reply to 84705)

Sown: Hi, How can i parse the content Cell data result from getJettonData to a Js object? const { content } = await jettonRoot.getJettonData();

[+_-]: Good day everybody! I'm figuring out Jetton implementation right now, and I'm a bit confused with op::mint() operation as it don't handle revert case properly:  Here we are minting tokens and increasing the supply right after:         mint_tokens(to_address, jetton_wallet_code, amount, master_msg);         save_data(total_supply + jetton_amount, admin_address, content, jetton_wallet_code);  But, if there is a problem, we are not properly handling this case as contract has this code here:     if (flags & 1) { ;; ignore all bounced messages         return ();     } So, does it mean, if something goes wrong on receiver's side, we gonna get inconsistent state (our supply will include non-existent tokens)?

Lennox: Is it v5 or W5, and how do you do that (reply to 84622)

slavagm: just send nft to new address (reply to 84709)

Ruslan: Hello, first of all make sure you have sent this BOC in the blockchain. For example, you've called POST-request to toncenter.com/api/v2/sendBocReturnHash or to toncenter.com/api/v3/message. Then you could take a hash of the BOC and try to find the transaction in the blockchain using method toncenter.com/api/v3/transactionsByMessage with hash of your boc and direction="in". Call this method until you get the transaction. (reply to 84729)

Catid: thank you (reply to 84730)

Catid: one questtion  i use my wallet as a bank for receive the people purchase my item  its okay ? (reply to 84730)

Œª markus.py: Hello, I am building an application with TON, and I need to get all the transactions of the blockchain in real time. I thought about connecting with ADNL to a self-hosted liteserver node, but I am finding it difficult to find the exact way to get all transactions, if it's possible at all. I was wondering how explorer websites do it ü§î Do they poll the block height and when it changes they get all candidates from the previous confirmed block?

Prince: My script is faster than dextools

Œª markus.py: I would prefer if it were possible to get unconfirmed transactions too from the mempool, but confirmed-only is okay as well, since TON is fast at confirming them anyway.

Œª markus.py: May I ask how it works, or if there are open source examples for my problem? (reply to 84741)

Prince: of course not. kk (reply to 84743)

Ruslan: For now you can use some indexer API. Here are three options: toncenter.com/api/v3/, tonapi.io, dton.io. In case of toncenter.com, you can run your own instance of indexer from this github: github.com/toncenter/ton-indexer, but it actually requires a powerful hardware and some effort. (reply to 84740)

Jan-Willem: I get an error when I try to get the transactions of an address: "LITE_SERVER_UNKNOWN: cannot locate transaction in block with specified logical time"  https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getTransactions?address=UQC0GM7WCQGIsfgGiOFJ4DHzKkIlGXag0MAelUFicdlTCl5T  On tonviewer it's all fine: https://tonviewer.com/UQDDI7K4HvpvKpZyDx775vXnIWOow0FH7pdQ6_llyTV08ziQ

Prince: you want that script? are you dev so that understand mine easily?

Œª markus.py: Thanks! Does it work in real time? Or does it require polling? (reply to 84746)

Catid: mr ruslan please  its not my fault right ? (reply to 84739)

Cryptskii: Hey hey. Gm everyone. I'm looking for 1 experienced crypto and or game dev a hungry self starter with a track record of success for business end as well as if anyone know a wicked animator to hire for game cutscenes that will get added to our YouTube channel. We have a product that given the right additional people listed above, can definitely outshine the Hamsters. I have working demo and some awsome ways to sustain the value of our token as it will end up being the governance token for either  a dex/bridge for TON using zpks or or a private payment channel protocol using zkp and bridging for TON maybe looking at Dogecoin or BTC. Don't bother inquiring at this point unless you are cofounder material. Thanks. Have a great day all. We will post something in the future for more non core team /co-founder positions. If you are highly capable you can see for yourself that we also "walk the walk" not just 'talk the talk "  this project has been designed to be fun, simple, attention grabbing, and just enough outrageous aspects to be looked at as a fun telegram bot game that also happens to have a token. Mass adoption happens when  people are using it while barely Even realizing there was a difference. One day you Wael and your using it but without any changes in the users day to days. Like how got us using bank cards instead of checks or dvd instead of VHS. This starts with providing a user experience and appeal base on things you've target customers are already looking at and then sneaking the technology change in. In game Incentives work great up until the drop, for but the numbers aren't even close to what  is maintained LT.   Hamsters has the grind part set up well for ease of olanboarding and feel of accomplishment by providing mini goals as a read crumbs trail to keep it less redundant but they lack a strong storyline and narrative. Crypto exchange CEOs tend to get jail time lol. Our game follows a theme and narrative that has a proven track record of success and constant appeal. Some have their hype cycles but not this. It involves an emersive storyline but without any more attention involved that what is needed for Hamster Kombat. Aldo is you like GTAV art style, you'll for sure love our vibes üòé if you think you have what it takes to help steer the ship, get at me

Ruslan: Depends on your needs. Is this enought to process deposits and withdraws? Yes. Is this the fastest way to receive transactions? No, the fastest is to parse messages from the mempool, and then lookup for transactions manually (second part actually requires indexer). (reply to 84749)

Constantine: Hello everyone! I have a problem with sending tons (in MAINNET, NOT a testnet). I got a free api-key to use toncenter API. I make a post request to send tons. Then i get a response with a successful status code (200), but the transaction doesn't happen! I tried to use toncenter api v2 and v3 ‚Äî the result is the same.  I sure that seqno and mnemonic are right (when I pass the wrong value of one of them expressly, I just catch an error in my try/catch block of code). I use TonSdk .Net for C# (i know that it's not a popular way to work with Ton, but i think my problem is pretty general). I also added the console output to view the response of toncenter, so here it is: response as itself: {   "Version": "1.1",   "Content": {     "Headers": [       {         "Key": "Content-Type",         "Value": [           "application/json"         ]       },       {         "Key": "Content-Length",         "Value": [           "63"         ]       }     ]   },   "StatusCode": 200,   "ReasonPhrase": "OK",   "Headers": [     {       "Key": "Date",       "Value": [         "Fri, 12 Jul 2024 23:55:26 GMT"       ]     },     {       "Key": "Connection",       "Value": [         "keep-alive"       ]     },     {       "Key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",       "Value": [         "*"       ]     },     {       "Key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",       "Value": [         "GET, POST, OPTIONS"       ]     },     {       "Key": "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",       "Value": [         "User-Agent,Keep-Alive,Content-Type,X-API-Key,X-Ton-Client-Version"       ]     },     {       "Key": "CF-Cache-Status",       "Value": [         "DYNAMIC"       ]     },     {       "Key": "Server",       "Value": [         "cloudflare"       ]     },     {       "Key": "CF-RAY",       "Value": [         "8a24f6cfcd591db1-FRA"       ]     }   ],   "TrailingHeaders": [],   "RequestMessage": {     "Version": "1.1",     "VersionPolicy": 0,     "Content": {       "Headers": [         {           "Key": "Content-Type",           "Value": [             "application/json; charset=utf-8"           ]         },         {           "Key": "Content-Length",           "Value": [             "286"           ]         }       ]     },     "Method": {       "Method": "POST"     },     "RequestUri": "https://toncenter.com:443/api/v3/message",     "Headers": [       {         "Key": "X-API-Key",         "Value": [           "HERE IS MY TONCENTER API KEY"         ]       }     ],     "Properties": {},     "Options": {}   },   "IsSuccessStatusCode": true }  response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(): "{\"message_hash\":\"JKKwXRW99f9pQHmm7lB4aAjtTzSYZk07nmATtchv3rI=\"}"  I get it when i use toncenter api v3. Then I trying to search for the transaction using this message_hash on the tonviewer or tonscan and every time i get 404. What is interesting (and i dont know ‚Äî is it because of the lib I use or notü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) ‚Äî when I use api v2, the last strings will be: response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(): "{\"ok\":true,\"result\":{\"@type\":\"ok\",\"@extra\":\"1721005373.9275637:5:0.8041017270676435\"},\"id\":\"1\",\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}"  What also is interesting ‚Äî there is no problems with get methods. I succesfully get the right seqno for my wallet. Also, in another part of my project, i easily run a get-method to search for transaction by msg_hash wich i get when user sends tons to me using tonconnect.  So what can be the reason??? Is it because of my api-key is free (i mean, i use a free plan on toncenter api)??? After all the research i done, i find it the only possible reasonü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Help me pleaseüò©üò©üò©

Denisa: Hello, I am trying to run some custom logic when a specific transaction has been sucessfully completed. Currently, when I send the transaction I get back a bag of cells that i have no ideea how to decode. I need to somehow get the transaction(s) hash so that I can later on validate that it has completed successfully. Can anyone help me achieve this? This is the code that makes the transaction.  const response = tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({           messages: [             {               address: args.to.toString(),               amount: args.value.toString(),               payload: args.body?.toBoc().toString('base64'),             },           ],           validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes for user to approve         });  How do i decode the bag of Cells that is the response?

Catid: exusme anyone can tell me what is payload on ton ?

&rey: Part of cell which tells destination contract how to process the message. For TON sending, it is either empty or 32 zero bits with UTF-8 comment following. Comment is normally ignored by contracts. (reply to 85207)

&rey: The method https://github.com/yungwine/pytoniq/blob/ea967cd13d37e9e5e5035a6d8132a6a1abc0d5a4/pytoniq/liteclient/client.py#L733 returns block IDs. (reply to 85204)

Catid: if you send tons  you just don't need to pay for loading, right?   if send ton to buy item what need payload   while the tons sent are from wallet A to wallet B (reply to 85209)

Zero: Hey what's ton's testnet RPC?

Alexander: Hi! I found a potential vulnerability that could be caused by following the official TON documentation in the context of backend authorization through TON Connect. In the section Checking ton_proof on Server Side#4 it is suggested to check the timestamp that came from the client side. Despite the fact that such a timestamp is part of the signed data, the wallet can still set it to any value. Therefore, we cannot ensure the correctness of "is actual at the moment" statement verifying based on this value. If you'd like to implement a timeout/expire for your payload, it might be worth saving the timestamp on the backend or including it in the signed payload.

User<7342101956>: Friends, please tell me.    I have a smart contract developed by Tact using BluePrint.  Now I want to make a web2 interface so that everyone can deploy their smart contract in the same way when they click on a button. (Well, I‚Äôm still collecting data through the form)  I'm writing an application in React.  It‚Äôs not clear how to deploy a smart contract. In Blueprint, the framework does this and compiles 2 times.   How can you do this in a react? Maybe there are guides?  My hypotheses must be some compiled moments after the blue print. Which I just somehow insert into the TS. It‚Äôs not clear what kind of instance it is and where to find it? Somewhere in the buffer data?  Thanks if anyone answers ;)

[+_-]: Good day everybody!  Maybe a silly question, but I don't quite understand why when building a message in a short form  with .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 32 + 1 + 1 + 1) line, two VarUInteger 16 values (ihr_fee and fwd_fee) are each encoded with 4 bits?

[+_-]: Can you please clearify, what sort of problem you are facing due contract deployment?  Anyway, if you are building an app, you can compile and deploy any contract via functionality, that is declared by default in blueprint project template, that you can create with $ npm create ton@latest (reply to 85268)

User<7342101956>: Am I understanding correctly that I can't use React and Blueprint at the same time? Should I use the ton library for server deployment? (reply to 85271)

[+_-]: Aw, so you meant that the idea was to compile and deploy contract on the front-end side of application, right?  I haven't tried such an approach, but I think task separation between your frontend and backend sides of application gonna be a really good decision anyway (reply to 85272)

User<7342101956>: I don‚Äôt understand how you can pass the user signature to the back end.  Let's say I have a back end with blueprint. I don't quite understand how I can pass the user's transaction signature to the back end (reply to 85273)

:D: is the toncenter api as bad as mainnet as for testnet?

&rey: No, plus Orbs is rather stable for mainnet. (reply to 85275)

User<7342101956>: Thx! (reply to 85277)

:D: gotcha, orbs is not operational for testnet right? (reply to 85276)

&rey: Your contract artifacts should be in some directory like build/ or like. They should be copied into dApp code, then it's easy to deploy contracts without interaction with backend. (reply to 85268)

Egene: It was extremely weird, it just stopped working out of the blue without any changes in our end.  What's even weirder is that it only did not work when being served via an HTTPS proxy. We tried switching from Apache to Nginx and had the exact same issue. Double checked all configs - nothing.  Then we compared the configs with another WebApp we have that also uses TonConnect. The configs were identical.  What we did was deployed the WebApp in place of the other working WebApp and the problem was magical fixed.  We suspect it had something to do with the fact that the subdomain used starts with a number and Tonconnect does not like it for some reason ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ  But that's not certain, we have not investigated the problem further.

Next, I imported the jetton file  import "./sample_jetton";   and used the TokenTrasnfer message  receive("Finish") {         require(self.playersCount == MaxPlayers, "Maximum");         require(sender() == self.owner, "Only owner is allowed to finish game");         require(self.state.status == StatusStarted, "Only started game is allowed to finish");          nativeRandomizeLt();           let wonAmount: Int = (self.ticketsCount * ton("1") - self.meta.comissionAmount);          let winnerTicket: Int = random(1, self.ticketsCount + 1);          let winner: Address = self.state.tickets.get(winnerTicket)!!;          self.state.winnerTicket = winnerTicket;         self.state.status = StatusFinished;                   send(SendParameters{                 to: winner,                  value: 0,                 mode: SendIgnoreErrors,                  bounce: false,                 body: TokenTransfer{                     queryId: 0,                     amount: 100,                     destination: winner,                     response_destination: self.owner,                     custom_payload: emptyCell(),                     forward_ton_amount: 0,                     forward_payload: emptySlice()                 }.toCell(),             });       }    I wanted to send 100 jettons to the address of the winner in my lottery  then I ran the script. The lottery winner was selected but the tokens were not sent to him.  const sendParams = {         value: toNano('0.1'),          bounce: false      };       await lotteryJtl.send(         owner, {              value: sendParams.value,          },           'Finish'     );   how can I solve this problem, please help me üôè

Paul: Should send message to jetton wallet of winner. In your case, you can get jetton wallet address of winner at client and send it in body of message. (reply to 85544)

Stephan: The Jetton Wallet address is similar to a regular TON address. The address is defined in the winner variable (reply to 85551)

Super_hands: Hi guys. I have a something wierd experience. I sent several msgs to testnet by my tonkeeper android app with testnet wallet (starting from 0Q...).  But same transactions sent to mainnet. What's the problem?

Super_hands: It seems I can't upload screen captures. (reply to 85553)

Super_hands: link also :(

Paul: Oh sorry, send it to jetton wallet address of smartcontract. Is your contract hold reward balance, right? (reply to 85552)

&rey: The problem is that you should not have used same mnemonic across networks. Same signatures are valid both in mainnet and in testnet. (reply to 85553)

Super_hands: OMG (reply to 85563)

Super_hands: It's way toooooooooo different with EVM ....

&rey: I doubt. I guess that if you signed a transaction on Ethereum it would be also valid in some fork. (reply to 85565)

Super_hands: Then in tvm, during the process of proving signature is valid or not, the chainId is not considered?

Super_hands: NO in evm, chainId is different between mainnet and testnet. So signature is different even though people use one mneumonic phrase over chains.

&rey: It is not. CHKSIGNU at its core just checks given Ed25519 signature with a public key.  In theory, wallet applications should mix chainId into subwalletId which is in signed data, but they have not done so for unknown reason. (reply to 85567)

Super_hands: Ah you mean, both chainId in mainnet and testnet is equal ???

Bingo: Hello everyone I need your help Recently I am trying to implement same logic with the contract 0x40e9187078032afe1a30cfcf76e4fe3d7ab5c6c5 in ERC-20 But the network will be in Ton. I am trying to code jetton wallet. Please help me how to do this. I am new in Ton so any helps are appreciated

&rey: I mean, subwalletId is equal, and it shouldn't have been. (reply to 85571)

Stephan: Yes, there are 1000 tokens on the contract, but they are not being sent (reply to 85560)

&rey: Please take a look at existing jetton wallet codes. You can do that in explorers (Tonscan/Tonviewer), switching to tab with contract and opening "code". (reply to 85572)

Paul: yes,  send(SendParameters{                 to: winner,<- should be jetton wallet address of smartcontract, not address of winnner                 value: 0,                 mode: SendIgnoreErrors,                  bounce: false,                 body: TokenTransfer{                     queryId: 0,                     amount: 100,                     destination: winner,                     response_destination: self.owner,                     custom_payload: emptyCell(),                     forward_ton_amount: 0,                     forward_payload: emptySlice()                 }.toCell(),             }); (reply to 85574)

PAUL üêæ: i am a fullstack web developer , i'm interested to be part of any ongoing project , i need to connect please

Amir: Thank you for your help brother. I think the domain is the problem, we launched the exact same web app on another domain and the wallet connects without any problem, it's very strange! (reply to 85317)

Egene: did your domain also have a number in it? (reply to 85617)

Egene: maybe we should open a github issue? But we need more info on what domains do not work so that the devs have something to work with

Amir: Unfortunately, no, but  the same mini-app works on another domain, the strange thing is that the wallet does not connect only in the mini-app, if we open the site in the browser, it connects.  Also, we tested all the wallets in TonConnect and only TonKeeper does not connect!  Anyway, I don't think it has anything to do with the domain and the problem is probably from TonKeeper's side, because connecting TonKeeper to the Notcoin bot doesn't work either (you can test it right now). (reply to 85618)

Egene: When you open it in the browser are you also opening it via HTTPS (same as in the mini App) or are you testing via HTTP? (reply to 85621)

Egene: Cause from our side we found that via HTTP it works on any domain. Issues only arise when Https gets involved

Amir: Always using HTTPS (Full mode - Cloudflare), with HTTP i got 404 error for tonconnect-manifest.json (so strange again!) (reply to 85624)

Nerses: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math#:~:text=Computes%20and%20returns%20the%20SHA,bits%20of%20data%20in%20total).    as sha256 works like this how i can do sha of this data ¬†¬†¬†¬†myAddress(): Address,     sender(): Address,     ctx.value: Int,     dstChain: String;     dstAsset: String;     dstAddress: String;     srcAsset: String;     srcReceiver: Address;     timelock: Int;      messenger: Address;  ¬†¬†¬†?

Frankovitz: Hi guys! I'm trying to get all NFTs addresses from a collection using Tonweb, but can't realize how, because my code returns some info about collection, its owner, but nothing about NFTs themselves.  js const NftCollection = TonWeb.token.nft.NftCollection; const NftItem = TonWeb.token.nft.NftItem; const nftCollection = new NftCollection(tonweb.provider, {      ownerAddress: walletAddress,      nftItemCodeHex: NftItem.codeHex }) console.log(nftCollection);

v1t4l3y: Hi guys  I want to launch a validator in Testnet  Can someone send me enough tokens to apply to the validator list?

Prince: Have you ever used that for kind of dex? (reply to 85870)

Prince: I can get trade transactions and you know amount_in, amount_out, But corresponding to that transaction, what is the best way to get jetton and native's price at that time?

:D: you wish to get the hash of each individual value? or the whole thing (reply to 85869)

:D: just turn each of them into a slice  and pass it in that way

Nerses: i want sha256 of concatenated all that data.but in case i concatenate after 127 bytes everything is added as reference which is skipped by sha function (reply to 85882)

:D: ah yeah, so you can't do it like that

v1t4l3y: @f_closer could you give tokens in testnet to launch validator (reply to 85878)

:D: just the library's limitation

:D: you could make your own custom function, or just turn the slice into a hex encoded string

&rey: The previous option was better (if it had not overflowed)... (reply to 85869)

:D: would be hard to get the pure bytes hashed

Nerses: in simple words i want exactly implement this solidity code in TACT     commitId = sha256(       abi.encodePacked(         address(this),         msg.sender,         msg.value,         dstChain,         dstAsset,         dstAddress,         srcAsset,         srcReceiver,         timelock,         messenger       )     ); (reply to 85887)

:D: youd have to write your own custom hashing  function then (reply to 85892)

&rey: Isn't there a problem with different address formats? So, one-to-one conversion is not possible. (reply to 85892)

&rey: Yes. What are the types of dstChain/dstAsset/...? (reply to 85895)

Nerses: No in my case i implemented in solidity the smart contract i need to do same for TON blockchain (reply to 85897)

Totti: Hi, could you explain about workchain and masterchain? Thanks

&rey: > There is a necessity for the synchronization of message routing and transaction execution. In other words, nodes in the network need a way to fix some 'point' in a multichain state and reach a consensus about that state. In TON, a special chain called MasterChain is used for that purpose.   > Blocks of masterchain contain additional information (latest block hashes) about all other chains in the system, thus any observer unambiguously determines the state of all multichain systems at a single masterchain block. (reply to 85963)

Kryptonite: when claim is processed smart contract does set_claimed()

Kryptonite: and then this function is used to check:  (int) get_claimed() method_id {     return get_data().begin_parse().preload_int(1); }

User<6323497659>: I am looking for a job, I am a UI UX designer and have good experience in the blockchain industry, I will take care of your project  Portfolio on request in the personal account

&rey: set_data(begin_cell().store_uint(1, 1).end_cell()); is same in effect but costs more. (reply to 85990)

Kryptonite: so if i am right, it pops out previous persistent data and store 1 instead (reply to 85995)

Sumit: What else are my options? (reply to 86017)

&rey: Let users' wallets handle that and process all messages coming to your contract. (reply to 86018)

Sumit: so i have a bridge transaction, which we process in our contract. And we dont want to process the same tx again and again (reply to 86019)

Sumit: we want to abort if its already processed (reply to 86021)

&rey: Is there a chance that you can process transactions in order of seqno increase? (reply to 86021)

Vladislav: Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well  I assembled the project using a redirect following the tutorial https://github.com/alefmanvladimir/lesson10/tree/main  Three hooks are implemented from the directory https://github.com/alefmanvladimir/lesson10/tree/main/src/hooks: useAsyncInitialize.ts useTonClient.ts useTonConnect.ts  Using this example, I‚Äôm trying to deploy my contract on the TESTNET. I successfully pull the data to initialize the command, I receive a confirmation message in the Tonkeeper, and the transaction is successful. BUT! As a result, my contract is inactive, and Tonscan says: "Uninitialized address This address doesn't contain any data in blockchain ‚Äî it was either never used or the contract was deleted. Now it just aimlessly floats in the digital void."  I don‚Äôt understand where I could have an error, because the transaction is successful, each has an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù status. There are such operation codes in transactions, this is apparently a hash of the message sent in the transaction, two are normal, and one seems suspicious to me (the last one) Operation 0x3267f55 Operation 0x946a98b6 Operation 0xffffffff  Every transaction have status "OK"  My code: export function useDeployContract() {     const { client } = useTonClient();     const { sender, connected, wallet } = useTonConnect();     const [error, setError] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);     const [contractAddress, setContractAddress] = useState<Address | null>(null);     const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);      const deploy = useCallback(async (arg0: bigint, arg1: boolean) => {         if (!connected || !client || !sender || !wallet) {             setError("No client, sender, wallet or not connected");             return;         }          setLoading(true);         setError(undefined);          try {             const contractInit = await MyContract.fromInit(Address.parse(wallet), arg0, arg1);             const contract = client.open(contractInit);             console.log(contract.address.toString()) // Exists             console.log(contract.init?.code.toString()) // Exists             console.log(contract.init?.data.toString()) // Exists              let isContractDeployed = await client.isContractDeployed(contract.address);             if(isContractDeployed) {                 throw new Error("MyContract already deployed");             }              // this await call is executed instantly             await contract.send(                 sender,                 {                     value: toNano('0.05'),                 },                 {                     $$type: 'Deploy',                     queryId: 0n,                 }             );              // so here I will add senqo checking logic                      isContractDeployed = await client.isContractDeployed(contract.address);             if(!isContractDeployed) {                 throw new Error("MyContract deployment failed");             }                      setContractAddress(contract.address);         } catch (error) {             setError(error.message || "Unknown Error.

BlockchainDev: Hi all,  While i send jetton to another wallet via (js) its getting error. I don't know the reason of error. Please give me a suggestion to solve this.

BlockchainDev: let mnemonic = " YOUR MNEMONIC PHRASE" const keyPair = await mnemonicToWalletKey(mnemonic.split(" "));  Now you can get keypair (reply to 86148)

Sina: Hello, I hope you are doing well.  I am encountering an error after importing the Unity TON SDK.   'Wallet' does not contain a definition for 'Account' and no accessible extension method 'Account' accepting a first argument of type 'Wallet' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)    Has anyone experienced this issue before? I am following the documentation but still facing this problem.  Thank you for your help!

BlockchainDev: Use this  const { mnemonicToWalletKey } = require("@ton/crypto"); (reply to 86153)

Kryptonite: if i remove it , code works properly

&rey: They do so by sending messages. (All workchains in TON are meant to support messages in form of cells.) (reply to 86059)

Kryptonite: the moment i try to store slice to store address it gives bitbuilder error

minhtienhcmus: actual jetton transfer fails (reply to 86186)

Louis: How to deploy Jetton contract in factory contract

Tang: Hello I am developing a game on unity WebGL to be played as a mini-app inside Telegram. My team and me managed to send a TON transaction using the ton-connect sdk, however we are facing this issue: The telegram wallet does not pop up automatically when receiving the transaction request. Users have to manually switch between the game window and the telegram wallet, which is a huge barrier to make the transaction seamless in our project. I would be very grateful if someone could indicate me how to achieve this, or where to look for to find the documentation telling how to make the telegram wallet window pop-up?

Vladislav: [SOLVED] I missed the stateInit field in the message I was sending  In this example https://github.com/alefmanvladimir/lesson10/blob/main/src/hooks/useTonConnect.ts should be block of code like this: const stateInit = (args.init && beginCell()     .store(storeStateInit(args.init))     .endCell().toBoc().toString("base64")) ?? undefined;  tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({     messages: [         {             address: args.to.toString(),             amount: args.value.toString(),             payload: args.body?.toBoc().toString("base64"),             stateInit: stateInit,         },     ],     validUntil: Date.now() + approveDelay, });  and since I was not familiar with react, I hoped that this hook was fully implemented, and I didn‚Äôt look there at all  and someone previously answered that it is necessary to provide statInite. But since I didn‚Äôt understand what it was and where to look, I was missing a couple of links  Basic documentation: https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/addresses#what-happens-when-you-transfer-toncoin-to-an-uninit-address  And a link to an example application code from TC2: https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-with-react-ui/blob/07342b27e406fd4a00d59f2042afbbdc7bbdefb4/src/server/api/create-jetton.ts#L70  I hope this information will help beginners who will be looking for information (reply to 86067)

PizzaVPN: Hello guys I was trying to write some tests for transferring jettons after 10 years inside my func contract but when I moved the blockchain. now  to 10 years later and checked my jetton_wallet account state It says it is frozen.  Afaik this happened because of low credit (less than -0.1 TON).  My questions are: 1. How can I unfreeze my jetton_wallet? Should I first top-up my jWallet's TON balance and then deploy it with the last stateInit? 2. If this happens for all version1 jetton_wallets, what is the universal solution to this situation? people should top-up their wallet balances if they want to keep their jettons?

Anton: Hello everyone! This might be slightly off-topic, but I have a question regarding monetization. I am reading the documentation on the official Telegram website and the TON website. I encountered a contradiction:  In the FAQ section on the Telegram website, there is an answer to the question about whether a mini app can receive payments in cryptocurrencies, and the answer is "no, you must use Telegram Stars." I thought - okay.  But in the documentation about mini apps on the TON website, the very first line says that Wallet Pay is the main payment system for Telegram Mini Apps.  Could you please clarify where the truth lies and maybe explain the differences in a few words? Useful resources are also very welcome. Thanks in advance üôÇ

Pouya: hi

Almatbek: Are there any companies or projects seeking a talented developer?

&rey: There are, in @tonhunt. (reply to 86525)

Mahdi: Hi all.  We want to transfer our NFTs from Polygon network to TON network. Our NFTs have a quantity in the polygon network, for example, we have 100 of each item. This quantity for items does not exist in TON network or we did not find a way for it. Can you guide me? This is very important for us, otherwise we cannot use TON network. This may be a problem for many developers.  Thanks for attention

&rey: That concept maps to jettons with "render_type": "game" (per Token Data Standard https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md), though I'm not sure if explorers implemented that. (reply to 86535)

&rey: Please check tonapi API. (reply to 86505)

Mahdi: Thanks for your answer but With this method, can we have meta data that can be defined on NFT on the token? It is important for us that there is metadata in the network. (reply to 86536)

Mahdi: @andreypfau can you help us? (reply to 86535)

Adam: can someone recommend an experienced TON dev? i need some help and i will pay

Mahdi: I mean this Quantity value.  how should we handle this in TON chain? (reply to 86535)

Carterüßπ: Question about OutMsgDescr on Block Extra which is a Dictionary of a key byte32 and OutMsg, what does the key represent, is it the Transaction Hash? Because querying tonviewer with the hex for this, does not bring back any transactions?

Bode: I sent usdt to bybit with the wrong tagmemo, I opened a ticket there and it returned it, but I haven't received my funds in my wallet yet, I noticed on tonviewer that the funds come from another wallet and bybit sent them back to that wallet, I believe which is supposed to be a ton wallet, how do I demand my ton funds?

Bode: who can help me please

Highly: You sent a ticket to bybit about it already ?   I don't quite get you though (reply to 86578)

Bode: yes, I already sent the ticket to bybite and they resolved it by sending my funds back, but it does not appear in my ton wallet, I believe that my funds have left and returned from a main ton wallet

Bode: I have the exit and return ID, I leave and enter the same wallet, but it's not mine

Bode: @tom_king_s you are adm?

Carterüßπ: What is the appropriate way to determine the Tx Hash of a confirmed transaction? I'm just trying to verify my code.  Is it the representation hash of the OutMsg, the Message, or the Transaction? Or something else entirely?

Carterüßπ: I can see here that the OutMsgDescr is the message hash.  But certain messages, when you take their key, are not located on explorers like tonviewer, I assume because they are OutExternal messages, with no destination. I'm trying to find the source Transaction of this message. So assuming I have the correct TxHash, I can use the previous message from this account as the source of this OutMsg?  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/5c392e0f2d946877bb79a09ed35068f7b0bd333a/doc/tblkch.tex#L244  The outbound message description {OutMsgDescr} uses the 256-bit message hash as a key.

MZ: When I try to connect wallet on mobile and click "Open Wallet in Telegram" everything works good.  However when I click "Open Wallet in Telegram" using Telegram desktop app it opens Wallet, but I see something like on the screen.  So I dont't see "Connect Wallet" button, but have an option to create a new wallet. Meanwhile as you see I have wallet already created and just would like to connect it.  What is the reason? I use @tonconnect/ui-react.

Kryptonite: export async function sendDeposit(contractAddress:Address,amount:string,tonConnection:TonConnectUI){   const tx:SendTransactionRequest={     validUntil:Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 100,     messages:[       {         address:contractAddress.toString(),         amount:BigInt(toNano(amount)).toString(),         stateInit:undefined,         payload:                   beginCell()                 . storeUint(Opcodes.deposit,32)                 . endCell()         .toBoc().toString("base64")       }     ]   }   await tonConnection.sendTransaction(tx); }   how to configure to send fees separately ?

Son: What data do I need in order to calculate a message hash? When I get the transaction from rpc, I got body hash but it‚Äôs always different from the message hash on tonscan. I think the message hash will need the body raw data but with some other data but I have no clue what that is. Thanks for your help.

adb: hi guys, I have a qq regarding minting NFTs with React/NextJs.  Any Help will be appreciated, because I am a bit lost in SDKs...  So there is a TonConnect UI Sdk that I can use to connect with user wallet and send transactions - this is clear.   Then, if I follow this tutorial (https://pinata.cloud/blog/how-to-mint-an-nft-on-ton/) they use tonweb SDK for NFT collection and items deployment.   From what I understand, my steps to deploy an NFT item are:   Use tonconnect for getting wallet info and TonWeb for deploying the NFT collection and minting NFT items. Is that correct or am I missing something?   Secondly, from what I understand the native wallet in telegram doesnt support the testnet. Could you please recommend a wallet that supports testnet?

Nerses: so it is possible existance of two Jettons according to TEP 74 but with different TL-B s ? (reply to 87202)

&rey: TEP-74 fixes only external TL-B interface of jetton systems. (reply to 87203)

Xipz { WILL_NOT_DM_FIRST }: New to TON but I've got a heavy background in EVM

Xipz { WILL_NOT_DM_FIRST }: Any big differences between TRC-20 and ERC-20?

&rey: TRC-20 isn't related to TON in any way. Maybe you wanted to ask about TEP-74? (reply to 87237)

&rey: That's quite unfortunate (many people find they are better off forgetting about EVM). (reply to 87235)

&rey: TON fungible token standard, TEP-74, dictates that each user's token balance is stored in a separate contract called "jetton wallet". "Jetton master" contract is responsible for mint and tracking total amount of jettons.

Xipz { WILL_NOT_DM_FIRST }: EVM made me tonnes in the past so I've got a soft-spot for it.  But, usually I'm in DeFi communities beforehand so I have an idea of the workflow of the blockchain (I.E. What dApps/services people use and the token standards), whereas with TON I literally haven't touched it until a few moments ago. Just looking for a few good sources of documentation haha.

Xipz { WILL_NOT_DM_FIRST }: Okay perfect, so Jettons are the standard for the contract and jettons are how you refer to any given token? (reply to 87241)

Lee: Hello, everyone.  I want to develop a feature that awards points through a simple game and later converts these points into Jettons through wallet integration. However, when trying to store all game-related data and points on the blockchain, the performance seems too slow and could be inconvenient for users. I am curious about how the TMAs in App Center or the DAPPs in Ton App might have solved this issue. Would it be acceptable to store game and point-related data on Web2 (cloud) and only handle the point-to-Jetton conversion through blockchain transactions?  It's not a short message, but I would really appreciate it if you could read it and respond. Have a great day, everyone.

[+_-]: Good day everyone! I've been looking through the core contracts of STON.fi and noticed something that I don't quite understand. It concerns the deserialization of the msg_body from a message with op::transfer_notification. In both repositories, stablecoin-contract and token-contract, the message body is stored in a reference:          var msg_body = begin_cell()             .store_uint(op::transfer_notification(), 32)             .store_uint(query_id, 64)             .store_coins(jetton_amount)             .store_slice(from_address)             .store_slice(either_forward_payload)             .end_cell();          var msg = begin_cell()             .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; we should not bounce here cause receiver can have uninitialized contract             .store_slice(owner_address)             .store_coins(forward_ton_amount)             .store_uint(1, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)             .store_ref(msg_body); But on the router contract side, the following code is used:  (int jetton_amount, slice from_user) = (in_msg_body~load_coins(), in_msg_body~load_msg_addr());         ;; Message body in reference?         cell ref_cs = in_msg_body~load_ref();         slice ref_ds = ref_cs.begin_parse();                  throw_unless(INVALID_AMOUNT, jetton_amount > 0);                  (int transferred_op, slice token_wallet1) = (ref_ds~load_uint(32), ref_ds~load_msg_addr()); To load the reference, we need to use ~load_ref(). However, we load int jetton_amount and slice from_user directly from msg_body, although on the token side it is stored like this: .store_ref(msg_body).  Can someone explain why this works correctly? Thanks in advance!

&rey: TON does not restrict apps you build with it, as it's The Open Network. Telegram might, so you should mind the distinction. (reply to 87378)

&rey: Admin should transfer jettons to contract. (With previous message I meant they cannot be pulled.)

Tony: Hello, I want to make a typescript script that tracks all transactions on the blockchain and filters jetton swaps. The goal is to track token prices. What library and api would you recommend for me to use? I'm having trouble figuring out how to use the toncenter api for this purpose. I also found ton console which has a /rates endpoint that gives the current token price but that won't work for me as it could miss some price spikes.  They also have a streaming api which can give me the transactions of jetton swaps but I don't know how to extract the token price from the transaction.  I'm not looking for dev work just some guidance on what to use but I'm willing to pay for any meaningful information, thank you!

&rey: Though I don't understand how you got to the question "store address=>amount dict" AFTER asking how to interact with jettons.

&rey: Tonapi traces, IIRC, return user's change in TON and jetton balance. (reply to 87497)

Prince: I want presale logic... as I told you

Prince: but I am beginner so there are many things to study and it takes so much time

&rey: Any chance you could use existing technology?

Tony: as far as I can see I can only get a trace by account or trace id. I wouldn't know what to query. I need to track all blockchain activity real time. For now the streaming api of tonapi looks ok but I don't understand how to extract the price from transaction id. With their transaction endpoint I only get the TON value and not the jetton value so I can't calculate price.   Although if someone knows a solution that won't rely on a third party api that would be best. (reply to 87499)

–û–≥—É—Ä—á—ñ–∫: This is example of code to create wallet:   Python from pytoniq_tools.wallet import WalletV4R2  def main() -> None:     wallet, public_key, private_key, mnemonic = WalletV4R2.create()      print("Wallet created!")     print(f"Address: {wallet.address.to_str()}\nMnemonic: {mnemonic}\n")  if __name__ == "__main__":     main()    how i can create Deterministic wallet? i would like to have one mnemonic, with a lot of wallets

Nerses: if i have smart contract which recives Jetton(actually its Jetton wallet contract receives ) how I can store in smart contract how many Jettons the contract receieved with certain message ? can ctx.value be used in this case ?

Kenny$$Shillz: Have u tried gecko terminal? (reply to 87497)

Kenny$$Shillz: It's complex to explain tbh but it's doable (reply to 87504)

Tony: the problem with using api for token price is that I may have 100k tokens in the future and its unpractical to keep pinging for tokens that are dead and have to transactions. That's why I want either some streaming or manual blockchain parsing (reply to 87545)

Kenny$$Shillz: Depends on the cost of the process u are undertaking (reply to 87529)

Nerses: and what will be done with remaing amount ? (reply to 87549)

Kenny$$Shillz: It can be retained or returned to message sender depending on send mode (reply to 87550)

Kenny$$Shillz: U can get token price from the exchange using the exchange's sdk (reply to 87548)

Tony: But I would still need to query for all tokens in my db? Which is impractical. I need to receive a stream of data and update only whats needed

Kenny$$Shillz: You can subscribe to block notifications using tonapi, query the transactions in each notification and filter them for swaps (reply to 87554)

Nerses: in this code         send(SendParameters{                 to: calculateUserJettonWalletAddress(myAddress().asSlice(),(self.commits.get(msg.data.commitId)!!).jettonMasterAddress,(self.commits.get(msg.data.commitId)!!).jettonWalletCode.asCell()).loadAddress(),                 value: ctx.value/2,                 bounce: true,                 mode: 0,                 body: TokenTransfer {                                     queryId: queryIndex,                                     amount: (self.commits.get(msg.data.commitId)!!).amount,                                     destination: (self.commits.get(msg.data.commitId)!!).sender,                                     response_destination: myAddress(),                                     custom_payload: null,                                     forward_ton_amount: ctx.value/2,                                     forward_payload: "Token Uncommitted".asSlice(),                                  }.toCell(),             }         );    here i have 3 values one is field value ,second one is amount  and 3rd is response_destination s what will be done what each field and what will be returned ? (reply to 87551)

Tony: yep, I mentioned that. I can even subscribe to swaps specifically -> https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/streaming-api#real-time-notifications-about-finalized-transactions  the problem is when I get the transaction id, how do I extract the token price from it? DeDust seems to not have the jetton amount in its inMsg data while StonFi only has minAmount which is good enough I guess (reply to 87555)

Tony: another thing that I see is that this stream also gives failed transactions and I don't see how to check which ones are failed and which not

&rey: Change subwallet ID. Btw, have you learned about wallet version differences, or chosen v4r2 arbitrarily instead? (reply to 87541)

Kenny$$Shillz: I'm not sure I get u but if u look in the stonfi payment from pool message you will be able to see how much was received from the swap .. hope this helps (reply to 87558)

Tony: how can I see the sonfi payment from pool message? which endpoint is this?

Kenny$$Shillz: U filter for the stonfi payment from pool op code instead of the stonfi swap opcode (reply to 87561)

Tony: You mean StonFiPaymentRequest?  Hmm, yeah I see that there is "value": {          "amount0_out": "2948823355752",           "token0_address": "0:27d1f23d42624f723f42abaf1d23efc2e63a5ec7b0e12e54bb026bbe10d42630",           "amount1_out": "0",           "token1_address": "0:1150b518b2626ad51899f98887f8824b70065456455f7fe2813f012699a4061f"         }  but for some reason one of the token amounts is always 0 , although if you check the transaction itself it is a swap. for example this one - d53d80dc1b9872a5091c4cc8fe58f5be232c934513276eac7d5a18a96471d783 (reply to 87562)

Nerses: having only jetton master address can i get init code and init data of that jetton off chain ?

&rey: "out" in English stands for "outgoing" ‚Äî result of swap ‚Äî jettons which are sent to user. (reply to 87564)

Tony: Yes, I get that. But the how would I extract the token price from this as I have only the jetton amount and not the TON amount? if I had amount1_in then it would be possible

Nerses: is there any reference ? (reply to 87567)

Kenny$$Shillz: No stonfi payment from pool I think (reply to 87564)

Tony: Also what is the difference between StonfiPaymentRequest and StonfiSwap? Shouldn't the swap be what contains the swap info?

Tony: I think you are confusing it with DedustPayoutFromPool? I don't see such in the list of ops - https://github.com/tonkeeper/tongo/blob/master/abi/messages.md (reply to 87572)

Kenny$$Shillz: You are correct (reply to 87574)

Tony: But DedustPayoutFromPool also seems to contain only jetton amoutn and not TON amount so I can't calculate token price from that either

Tony: Not jetton amount but rather whatevers being payout to user. jetton on buy and TON on sell

Kenny$$Shillz: The ton amount should be contained in the inmsg (reply to 87576)

Tony: i don't see it. For example transaction swapping 1709.9 USDT for 248.23 TON - 45871821f7d4375ad9c5353e1ec4b30584a9a85fd2598da59188e58f487672ed  decoded_body is:  "decoded_body": {      "query_id": 18012948399220787000,       "proof": "b5ee9c72010101010047000089800be0ac9f6bec08f07b6ae0639c39ecd1511a9a9adb4dbc9b6445697241adfb000040100b113a994b5024a16719f69139328eb759596c38a25f59028b146fecdc3621dfe8",       "amount": "1709903440",       "recipient_addr": "0:61ce7a48ecc27b37c2cf8d7ff7b33551e2b05e0adbb0215bdb2a81c84c9d026c",       "payload": null     }

Tony: only the usdt amount is there and I'm not even sure how to tell which token is it only by this data

Tony: Actually this payout seems to not be related to a swap event at all, looking at the transaction tree. It's something related to burn

Tony: So I guess I can't use payout anyway as I need swap data

Tony: shouldn't tracking jetton swaps be something simple üòÖ I've done it on evm chains and solana

–û–≥—É—Ä—á—ñ–∫: as i understand, 4 gen of wallet supports also subwallet? (reply to 87559)

T Rekt: anyone? (reply to 87526)

Tony: I will pay $200 just for info on what to use for this task. It doesn't need to be tonapi it could also be toncenter v3/v4, whatever. Just something that can do real time streaming and parsing of jetton swaps and calculating their price. (reply to 87584)

&rey: Do you have transaction ID in objects you get from streaming API? (reply to 87561)

&rey: If so, you can query traces with the transaction hash+lt. Probably.

Stephan: Hello guys. how to send tokens from a smart contract on a clock in addition to wallets?

yarik: Does anyone know if its possible to transfer all NFT's in one transaction via smart contract? How would this be done? Is there a limit?

&rey: Technically no, because each NFT is a separate contract and is thus updated by its own transaction, but you've probably asked another thing. (reply to 87604)

&rey: Actually, transfer from where?

yarik: From one wallet to another

&rey: Then there isn't a need to use any intermediate smart contract. (reply to 87610)

yarik: Could you elaborate? (reply to 87611)

yarik: As far as Im aware you cannot pass multiple transactions into the sendTransaction method in the ton sdk

&rey: You can, up to four for common wallets. (reply to 87614)

&rey: There's a list, after all.

yarik: Really? I didnt know that (reply to 87616)

[+_-]: Hello everyone! Just want to clarify a take - I don't see significant differences between using set_data with a canonical persistent contract storage and using global variables as an alternative. However, using global variables in the code looks cleaner and more appealing to me personally.  Does anyone have thoughts on this matter? Is there something about the first approach that requires using the contract's persistent storage only in "save_data() and load_data()" format?

User<6908616126>: Hi to everyone! tell me what is it "tonapi_brige_key" and where to get it

Diana: Hi! Did someone try send jetton transaction through tonconnect? I don't understand how to get jettonWalletContract

&rey: TON Cookbook has entire two sections devoted to that. (reply to 87904)

Snow Lee: JettonWalletContract is the contractAddress of the jetton itself (reply to 87904)

Snow Lee: You can find a jetton and get its master address

Snow Lee: Can do it straight on tonviewer too, and paste that address in place of the jettonWalletContract

Diana: is means one for all users? (reply to 87907)

Snow Lee: Yes, it's the jetton contract address, not the address holding your jetton, different things (reply to 87913)

Diana: thank you so much! (reply to 87914)

Snow Lee: You're welcome (reply to 87915)

Gerald: Hi everyone,  I need to implement a functionality for purchasing Jettons on a web page through ton-connector.

Could you please let me know if this is possible and, if so, provide a roadmap on how to achieve it?  Thank you very much!

Alfred: Of course. Create a receiver to receive the Jetton Transfer Notification of your contract's wallet and send the jetton from your contract to the user would be enough. (reply to 87923)

Alfred: Message flow: user's USDT jetton wallet -> contract's USDT jetton wallet -> contract -> contract NEW jetton wallet -> user's NEW jetton wallet.

Raf: Hi I've been adding many things in my repo. My last issue is comparing sender_address with a slice that is hardcoded (I want to restrain the address that can execute actions). Has someone done something like that somewhere ??

Raf: It seems that `sender_address`is sort of a special slice, that cannot never equals a regular slice, can someone help me with this ?  ~dump(sender_address); // s0 = CS{Cell{00b968010cf5ad0c22c7f07c351e92bdeb4706b4a6f5b9873900377243dd9aaaeda30d95002376fbc2fa0204898b96132939c5781a1850aec8e1bb7cbc527d3f7e5e874e07100bebc2000608235a0000000000d59f82cd41f8500000000540} bits: 4..271; refs: 0..0} ~dump(ctx_address1.begin_parse()); // s0 = CS{Cell{006045514347657461474557503450687150535637316f344e61553372637735794147376b683773315664744747796e5441} bits: 0..384; refs: 0..0}

&rey: Almost everyone does, using "SDEQ" opcode. In fact, data-same slices can be taken from different cell+offsets so they are printed differently. (reply to 87949)

Ashees: I wanted to know, is there any way in which we can read the values from other contracts in FunC?

&rey: Please stop spamming random messages, otherwise you will be banned. (reply to 87959)

Warren: yes there's a way

Raf: it does not work, slices are never the same (reply to 87952)

&rey: Btw, latter slice is not an address. (reply to 87951)

Warren: how do you run it?

Raf: ok so how am i supposed to store an address in a smart contract, and check later that sender_address matches this address ? (reply to 87963)

Raf: git clone git@github.com:fabcotech/ton-func-contracts.git npm i npm run test tests/PingPong2.spec.ts

&rey: (mind ~10s timeout between messages) (reply to 87965)

&rey: "EQC...TA" is not an address. "EQC...TA"a is. (reply to 87965)

Raf: ok I'm beginning to understand, So I guess the following (from contract wrapper) is not a good way of storing an address :  beginCell()     .storeRef(beginCell().storeStringTail('ping').endCell())     .storeRef(       beginCell()         .storeStringTail('EQCGetaGEWP4PhqPSV71o4NaU3rcw5yAG7kh7s1VdtGGynTA')         .endCell()     )     .endCell();  how should I do ?

&rey: .storeAddress(Address.parse('EQCGetaGEWP4PhqPSV71o4NaU3rcw5yAG7kh7s1VdtGGynTA')) would be correct. (reply to 87972)

&rey: Though most examples from that repository don't show much understanding of TVM or programming.

Also, sometimes it does not throw the pytonconnect.exceptions.UserRejectsError error when the user rejects the transaction. Does anyone know what the problem could be?

Buggy: Hi guys, I have question about calling state of another contract in my own contract. Foe example, in evm I can just use interface and inject address then call function or get state from the target contract, how can I do that in tact lang?

TG: You can call another contract's state using external calls with an interface, like in EVM. (reply to 88196)

Buggy: Do you have an example of how you do in tact? What I seen is only contract calling getter off-chain, how to it on-chain?

TG: Not in tact, but similar in evm  // Interface  interface IUniswapV2Pair {     function getReserves() external view returns (uint112, uint112, uint32); }  // Use the interface to call the function @kinmedai  contract MyContract {     function getUniswapReserves(address pairAddress) public view returns (uint112, uint112, uint32) {         IUniswapV2Pair pair = IUniswapV2Pair(pairAddress);         return pair.getReserves();     }

Buggy: Yeah, I mean I know how to do it in EVM, but I don't know how to do it in Tact, how can I see the example? (reply to 88201)

Buggy: Just an example of how MyContract.tact call IUniswapPair.getReserves() is ok, would appreciate.

TG: One sec

TG: // Interface for the GameScore contract interface GameScore {     function getReserves() external view returns (int, int, int); }

TG: Then below:  // Main contract that interacts with GameScore contract MyContract {     GameScore gameScore;      // Set the GameScore contract address     constructor(address gameScoreAddress) {         gameScore = GameScore(gameScoreAddress);     }      // Fetch reserves from the GameScore contract     function fetchReserves() external view returns (int, int, int) {         return gameScore.getReserves();     } }

Nerses: is there any example of script how to send Jetton from jetton owner to arbitrary address ?

Serhii: what‚Äôs the fastest way to make the transaction appear in the blockchain network?  should I send via tonapi, to a private or public lightserver, or are there other options?

&rey: If you send transaction everywhere, it may appear quite soon. Though if you send message via tonapi, it is also bound to appear in their, widely used, mempool so others can race against you. (reply to 88354)

Mikhail: Hey everyone, this method drops with "cell overflow"      elseif (context::op == op::process_claim) {         cell proof_cell = in_msg_body~load_ref();         int index = in_msg_body~load_uint(256);          (slice cs, int exotic?) = proof_cell.begin_parse_exotic();         throw_unless(42, exotic?);         throw_unless(43, cs~load_uint(8) == 3);         throw_unless(44, data::merkle_root == cs~load_uint(256));          cell dict = cs~load_ref();         (slice entry, int found?) = dict.udict_get?(256, index);         throw_unless(45, found?);          throw_unless(error::wrong_sender, equal_slices(context::sender, helper_address(helper_stateinit(proof_cell.cell_hash(), index))));          send_tokens(entry~load_msg_addr(), entry~load_coins());     }

Mikhail: How and why does this could be happening?

0xbera: how would "racing against" a tx seen in the mempool work? I assumed that each tx has its lamport time set i.e. there's no way to front-run it..? (reply to 88358)

&rey: Mempool only contains (external) messages, logical time is not yet filled at that moment. (reply to 88367)

0xbera: interesting .. at what point is the logical time for a tx set and by whom? (reply to 88369)

&rey: By validator importing that external message in a block. (reply to 88370)

Serhii: how do nodes determine which external txs from the mempool they want to include in the next block? (reply to 88369)

0xbera: ah .. an "external message" is not a tx yet .. hence no logical time set yet (reply to 88369)

&rey: Normally, they include all of them (if they are accepted and so on). Though consensus does not dictate that all messages are included. (reply to 88372)

0xbera: is there a way to construct an external message in such a way that it is more attractive to a validator? higher fee? or anything?

Anthony: how can I get the chat_id of a user when he opens my mini app ?

0xbera: more generally .. how are the fees for external messages determined and set?

Serhii: from what I know the fee doesn‚Äôt affect the ‚Äúattractivness‚Äù of the tx (reply to 88375)

0xbera: okay .. any other factors that do ? (reply to 88378)

&rey: The way to solve this question faster is to choose appropriate chat. Perhaps @devs. Second suggestion is to search in that chat history, as this seems like a common question. (reply to 88376)

Anthony: Yeah I searched but didn't find my answer.  Good news I found myself, using telegram sdks for your bot (like node-telegram-bot-api), you can actually send a message using a user's ID as chat_id and it works! (reply to 88381)

–∫.: Hi, if block time in TON is 5 second, so why some transactions take 2 minutes to be executed?

&rey: 1. Because messages from mempool can be included in some later block than they are published; 2. Because some things are not atomic transactions. (reply to 88416)

Vladislav: Excellent, thank you very much Allen ‚ù§Ô∏èü´µüòé (reply to 74118)

UncleRooks: Sorry guys m new to this

&rey: Have you already watched things starting from https://docs.ton.org/learn/introduction? (reply to 88424)

UncleRooks: I have read and watched the intro videos then I was redirected to stepik  I have started with stepik but it‚Äôs not explanatory and I always get stuck (reply to 88427)

&rey: The base of TON is that 1. all assets belong to smart contracts; users' wallets are smart contracts as well; 2. contracts can interact with each other using TON-carrying messages with arbitrary data attached, other interaction is impossible; 3. as a consequence of (2), each transaction only changes state of one contract. (reply to 88429)

&rey: Does that coincide with what you learned? Also, what direction do you want to learn next?

UncleRooks: Yes somewhat I wantu learn how to make smart contracts

UncleRooks: I think my major problem is I don‚Äôt have any good documentation to learn FunC

Nightfall: Hello, I have a question I have an entrypoint function in contract A that is used to create an id (auto increment) to send in a state init to contract B. Should I increase this id in contract A first before sending to contract B, or should I wait for B's confirmation (callback to A in another message) before doing the increment? I mean if I do the latter, is there any risk that 2 concurrent calls to this function will result in 2 contract B instances that share the same id? (reply to 87864)

Nightfall: on the other hand, if I do the increment first and stateinit message to B fails, then that index will also be invalid...

If you are receiving crypto as payment and are still using multiple spreadsheet to manage invoicing, hours tracking, cashflow tracking, constantly reminding clients on payments, drop me a message I would love to get you a free account with us.

&rey: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/ is the account. I do not know about one you've shown. (reply to 88591)

At the moment, I'm connecting to https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC and https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC.  But when I make requests on both simultaneously, it returns this error and fails the request:   message: "Request failed with status code 429" name: "AxiosError"

&rey: I don't know any freelancers who "are still using multiple spreadsheet". (reply to 88617)

Minh Don: What are yall using

&rey: I don't know. It is probably safe to use, though. In case of doubt, remember to DYOR. (reply to 88618)

&rey: From wallet? You need to use either a library (programming interface for wallet contracts) or TON Connect 2. (reply to 88572)

&rey: If you wait for B's confirmation, it is quite certain that you'll get same id at some point. (And there will be one B contract, actually.) (reply to 88568)

Alexander: Yep, for swift there‚Äôs definitely a thing https://github.com/nerzh/ton-sdk-swift (reply to 88629)

&rey: For mainnet, you can use Orbs ton-access. (reply to 88616)

Alexander: Don‚Äôt know for what reason people are using Orbs, the most unstable endpoints that I‚Äôve ever seen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (reply to 88634)

&rey: In my experience mainnet Orbs endpoints have rarely failed. (reply to 88635)

Alexander: There‚Äôs nothing free in our world, the error is saying that you‚Äôve reached the rate limit. You supposed to set up a some sort of limits of how many requests you are sending OR pay the rpc/node provider OR setup your own node and use it. (reply to 88616)

Nightfall: I mean waiting for B's confirmation as in "successfully processed the state init message, and then calling back contract A with an opcode indicating its success".  The counter still lives inside contract A.  What I want to ask is, since there are multiple messages (txs) in one flow, is there possible that there is another call to contract A before the callback from B arrives in A?  user 1 -> contract A -> state init contract B with id = 1 -> callback to contract A => A increase id to 2 user 2 -> contract A -> state init contract B with id = 1 (since callback to contract A still haven't arrived, so there would be an id conflict) (reply to 88624)

&rey: It is possible and quite certain to happen.

Nightfall: oh god... (reply to 88639)

Nightfall: this just raised the difficulty tenfold üò≠

Nightfall: so I need to make absolutely sure that the call to B will be successful

Alexander: Then you‚Äôre living outside of the real world, there‚Äôs a lot or otherwise you are paying for the software or even hiring someone to manage it to be compliant (reply to 88619)

Alexander: By the way, looks pretty convenient even I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. Do you guys support payments on TON? (reply to 88611)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: Thank you. Actually, I come from EVM and Substrate Eco to here. On those chains, there're usually RPCs to connect and rarely down, or they also have backup RPCs. (reply to 88637)

Minh Don: haven't yet EVMs for now. If TON is highly demanded I don't see why not in the future (reply to 88644)

Nguy·ªÖn Linh: Connect using this way is quite good option I think (reply to 88634)

Serhii: Is it possible to send external transaction directly to validator bypassing the liteserver?

&rey: Validator's interface to outer world is essentially liteserver, so I doubt so. (reply to 88649)

Alexander: In practice, liteserver usually plays a role of a middleman between you and validators (reply to 88650)

Alexander: Yes you can sending them to an overlay, that validators use to retrieve the messages (reply to 88649)

Tanya: who need a developer in telegram mini app development? I will help you.

[+_-]: Hello everyone! I'm a bit confused about action fees, specifically:  Action fees are deducted from the balance of the source account during the processing of the action list, which occurs after the Computing phase. These are the actions that incur fees:  SENDRAWMSG sends a raw message.  So, this is a separate, legitimate type of fee that needs to be accounted for if there are opcodes that trigger it(if I got this idea the right way). Here's the gas validation in the stablecoin contract: // 3 messages: wal1->wal2, wal2->owner, wal2->response // but the last one is optional (it's okay if it fails) throw_unless(error::not_enough_gas, msg_value > forward_ton_amount + fwd_count * fwd_fee + forward_init_state_overhead() + // additional fwd fees related to init state in internal_transfer get_compute_fee(MY_WORKCHAIN, send_transfer_gas_consumption) + get_compute_fee(MY_WORKCHAIN, receive_transfer_gas_consumption) + calculate_jetton_wallet_min_storage_fee() ); However, action fees aren't considered here. Why not? There is SENDRAWMSG after all. Furthermore, the documentation states: action_fees = sum(out_ext_msg_fwd_fee) + sum(int_msg_mine_fee)  Does this mean that the action fee consists of the forward fee for sending outgoing messages and the compute fee for incoming messages? I'm a bit confused about this, so I'd really appreciate it if someone who understands the fees well could clarify this for me.

–ï–µ–µ–µ: Hi everyone. I've tried to build and run HTTP API for TON. I've used Docker Compose. And now there is errors on Docker. How I can solve this problems?  https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api

&rey: async function requestNotcoinsDeposit(tonConnectUI, destinationAddress, amount) {     const senderAddressString = tonConnectUI?.account?.address;     const senderAddress = Address.parse(senderAddressString!!);     const jettonWalletAddress = await userNotcoinJw(senderAddress);          const messageBody = beginCell()         .storeUint(0x0f8a7ea5, 32).storeUint(0, 64)         .storeCoins(amount).storeAddress(destinationAddress)         .storeAddress(senderAddress).storeBit(0)         .storeCoins(1n).storeBit(0)         .endCell();          await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({         validUntil: Math.floor(new Date() / 1000) + 360,         messages: [{             address: jettonWalletAddress.toString(),             amount: toNano('0.04').toString(),             payload: messageBody.toBoc().toString('base64'),         }]     }); } (reply to 88733)

ETON: Hello, Why can't I use the ‚Äú~udict_delete?‚Äù method in the on_bounce function Deleting a piece of dictionary data, are there any dictionary operation restrictions on bounce message processing, outside of 224 bits

&rey: Bounce messages are pretty much same as common ones. What error does it give? (reply to 88741)

&rey: Notcoin contract comes into play just in userNotcoinJw function: async function userNotcoinJw(userAddress) {     const jettonMasterAddress = Address.parse('EQAvlWFDxGF2lXm67y4yzC17wYKD9A0guwPkMs1gOsM__NOT');     const client = new TonClient({endpoint: 'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC'});     const userAddressCell = beginCell().storeAddress(userAddress).endCell();     const response = await client.runMethod(jettonMasterAddress, 'get_wallet_address', [         {type: 'slice', cell: userAddressCell}     ]);     return response.stack.readAddress(); }  Have you known that as well? (reply to 88743)

&rey: Put two transfers in data list. (reply to 88716)

&rey: Alternatively, you can increase forward amount in Notcoin transfer. This approach will be less transferrable to sending multiple tokens, though. (reply to 88749)

&rey: Change the selected part. (reply to 88751)

Mikhail: like where i should put original message to have valid hash that can be verified on smart-contract?

Nerses: how can i rearrange this code to escape overflow ?   let slc: Slice = beginCell().storeStringTail("You recived tokens succefully").endCell().asSlice();   const forward_payload = beginCell()                           .storeUint(0x7362d09c, 32) // Function selector for the message type                           .storeUint(Number(queryId), 64) // queryId                           .storeCoins(amount) // amount                           .storeAddress(wallet.address) // from address                           .storeSlice(slc) // forward_payload; can be modified with additional data if necessary                           .endCell();

Sina: @pcrafter   I want to use /v2/events/emulate in tonapi but i don't know how pass data to this api  do you know how it works ?

Bohdan: Hello. I need to know if the transaction completed and if there were no errors. How can I check this? I use the pytoniq library for Python I will be grateful for your help

&rey: It seems you're doing something strange.

&rey: forward_payload should be just beginCell().storeUint(0, 32).storeStringTail("success").endCell(), not the whole message.
