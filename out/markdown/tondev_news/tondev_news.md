Unknown: 🔥 W5 Challenge Winners  We are pleased to announce results of the W5 optimization challenge. People were so much enthusiastic about W5 on TON Gateway'23, that’s incredible! On behalf of the entire TON community I express my gratitude to all the participants in our contest. Your part is a big step towards the future.   To underline this sentiment we decided to amend the original rules and increase the reward for the second and third place to make it even 1 TON per 1 gas unit saved on average for all winning participants (equivalent to 0.333 TON per each gas unit over three target execution paths, as per original rules).  Now, let's announce the winners.  🥇 The first place goes to Skydev  Skydev made two excellent contributions: a regular one and a more radical one, that involved patching the FunC compiler.   Skydev's radical option achieved whopping savings of 2927 gas units over three usage scenarios (28% on average) and we assign a reward of 975 TON, or 1 TON for 1 gas unit saved on average.  Congratulations!  🥈The second place goes to Davide Bartoli  Davide’s contribution saved 796 gas units total (7.8% on average) and we assign a reward of 265 TON.  🥉 And the third place goes to Behrang Norouzinia  Behrang's contribution was the most clean and straightforward and yet saved 506 gas units total (4.9% on average). And we assign a reward of 169 TON.   Conclusion  Gas price, rent price, and forwarding fees are necessary to protect the network against spam and reward validators for keeping consensus running. This is of the utmost importance because TON is a public resource shared by everyone. It is our duty as developers to make efficient use of this resource and produce the most optimal software possible. It’s doubly so for commonly used contracts such as a wallet.  30% savings on a wallet contract would mean that a billion users transacting daily would save around $2-5 million each day in transaction costs, or about $1 billion annually.  Congratulations to all the winners!  With love, Tonkeeper Team 💙 (forwarded from Oleg)

Unknown: New Update for TVM Instructions Search on docs.ton.org  We're excited to announce a significant improvement in the global search functionality on docs.ton.org. Previously, due to technical limitations, searching for TVM Instructions op codes was not supported.  From now on, every TVM Instruction can be searched using Fift syntax keywords. This is a result of the dedicated efforts through the TON Bounty and further upgrades to the Algolia search system.

Unknown: TON20 Inscription Use-case on TON Starting on December 5th, The Open Network (TON) experienced an incredible spike in network activity, thanks to the BRC20 Bitcoin Ordinals type of inscription use-case, called TON20, launched by the Tonano team.   Producing over 2 million transactions increased our network usage by 61 times within just half an hour. TON Community is proud to witness a creative use case take-off in TON driven by independent participants in the ecosystem.  Moreover, this sudden growth has revealed many interesting insights for our blockchain. Dynamic sharding technology worked as expected. At its peak, TON split into eleven shardchains, stabilizing at five shardchains to handle the heavy load.  At the same time, this phenomenon also revealed where the community should work to swiftly onboard the exponential increase in network activity expected in the near future. Network validators must ensure that TON is supported by hardware capable of scaling to the performance demanded by high usage.  Network Performance Delays This peak interest also came with a severe congestion of TON network, where validation was severely delayed even though the network validators are still producing blocks.   Popular wallets like @Wallet and Tonkeeper have paused the service temporarily.  TON core developers are aware of the issues affecting users and are working on TON blockchain. An initial technical report is available here. TON core team will be providing us with a further update within the next 24 hours.   We thank you and the community for your patience and unwavering support as we go through the growing pains together, preparing for the unprecedented growth season expected in the near future.

Unknown: 💎 Wallet Pay update: autoconversion feature  Wallet Pay has received an important update – the introduction of the autoconversion feature for all merchants on Telegram.  Autoconversion allows sellers to specify their preferred cryptocurrency for receiving payments, regardless of the cryptocurrency customers use for goods or services in Telegram.  Here's how it works  When creating a payment order, merchants can enable autoconversion, choosing from three supported cryptocurrencies: TON, USDT, or BTC. When customers pay for a product or service on Telegram, merchants will receive the cryptocurrency specified in the autoconversion parameters.  Do you have an example?  Certainly, imagine you sell virtual reality headsets and have enabled autoconversion to USDT. If a customer purchases the cutting-edge gadget with BTC, you'll receive payment in USDT instantly (Wallet Pay will automatically convert the crypto at the market rate).  For more details on autoconversion terms and to apply to connect Wallet Pay to your service, visit this link: https://pay.wallet.tg 👈 (forwarded from Wallet News)

Unknown: Meet the Toncenter API V3  It's an Indexer TON API, and we also call it "Turbo Indexer" because it's really fast: the indexer written in C++ works directly with the node database.  We started developing it while preparing for the world TPS record, when it became clear that the TON blockchain was holding a lot of load, but the supporting infrastructure wasn't always keeping up.  Key Features:  — Unprecedented indexing performance;  — Accounts, transactions, messages and blocks API. More methods and data than API V2;  — Jettons and NFTs API;  — Address Reform API;  — The naming of fields and structures is the same or close to the naming in the node;  — Fully open source, GPL-3.0 license;  — You can run your instance (archive node required);  In the next step, we plan to expand the V3 functionality even further.  We will also continue to support API V2, which makes queries directly to node and is indispensable for some tasks.  Mainnet API V3 - https://toncenter.com/api/v3/  Testnet API V3 - https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v3/  API Keys - @tonapibot  Sources - https://github.com/toncenter/ton-indexer (forwarded from Toncenter API)

Unknown: 🔥 W5 revision 2  Dear community, I'm proud to present the second revision of Wallet V5 project. I invite you to take a look at the specification and FunC source code, ask questions and give us all sorts of feedback.  👉 Specification 👉 FunC source for W5r2  💬 Discussion group for W5: https://t.me/+yNtJhu0BS6lmYWI0  What's new in revision 2?  Based on the valuable feedback from TON core team, we have addressed safety concerns in W5r1: 1. We removed support for setdata and setcode actions, 2. Wallet enforces sendmode flag 2 for all "send message" actions. 3. The wallet ABI is still compatible with original "wrapped C5 register" design, meaning that it is possible to swap out safe version of the wallet for unsafe one and still be able to use existing SDKs and tools without modification. (Might be useful in specific high-load usage on masterchain to save fees.)  Also, compared to revision 1: 4. New optimizations are added throughout by the contest winner @Skydev. 5. New operation type is available: turning signature verification on and off. This is an important feature for account recovery and migration use-cases, and it completes the authentication scope: wallet can be authenticated by signature and/or extension, in any combination of the two. For safety, sig auth cannot be disabled when there is no extension installed to avoid complete lockout.  Project timeline  Aug 2023 — initial sketch Sept 2023 — first working revision Oct 2023 — optimization challenge Nov 2023 — feedback & design review with TON community Jan 2024 — revision 2 early preview Feb/Mar 2024 — audit & peer review Mar 2024 — experimental support in Tonkeeper Pro  We are eager to get your feedback, please let us know what you think!  💬 Discussion group for W5: https://t.me/+yNtJhu0BS6lmYWI0 (forwarded from Oleg Andreev)

Unknown: 🔧 Introducing TON Replay  As our blockchain ecosystem thrives with countless developers and projects, evolving becomes a cautious task. Changes could unpredictably impact the ecosystem, making upgrades a slow and meticulous process. Often, theoretical issues might not even affect real-world applications.  🌟 But, there's a breakthrough! TON Core has launched the TON Replay project to tackle this challenge. The first fruit of this initiative is TonTVMReplay, developed by DTON. This tool emulates historical transactions on updated versions of the TON Virtual Machine (TVM). This means we can now test how real projects react to upgrades or network configuration changes before implementing them, ensuring smoother and safer evolution.  🔍 Looking Ahead: TON Replay isn't stopping there. We're developing advanced features for smarter checks. The goal is to ensure the practical outcomes of transactions—like transfers, swaps, and more—remain consistent, even if the transactions themselves change. This will enable us to run mirror networks and make significant, yet safe, modifications to the transaction executor.  🛠 More from DTON: Besides TonTVMReplay, DTON is also behind other developer-friendly projects, such as their blockchain index dton.io and the recently launched LSaaS (liteserver-as-a-service) via @liteserver_bot.

Unknown: 🏆 MyTonWallet Contest for iOS Developers  Prize fund: up to $25,000 Deadline: 23:59 on March 28th (Dubai time) Results: April 12th, 2024  The Task is to implement the new design for MyTonWallet as a new Swift app based on the provided mockups and archive with animations. Your submission must precisely represent the provided design – this includes all elements, their proportions and position on the screen, as well as their animations and transitions.  Required Functionality (Screens) 1. Auth Flow, including both creating and importing wallets. 2. Main Screen listing all user's tokens and recent transactions. 3. Transaction Info Modal featuring several transaction types.  Details While the task involves developing a new Swift app, some existing code from our current JavaScript app must be reused. Specifically, the API and blockchain integrations (which is already standalone and currently exposed as a web worker). To achieve this, a bridge must be implemented to allow running JavaScript process from the Swift environment (e.g., in an invisible WebView). This approach enables leveraging our existing API abstractions and focusing on the UI part without delving deeply into blockchain-related programming.  Evaluation Criteria During the evaluation stage our judges will test the submissions on a broad range of iOS devices. The key factors that will be used to determine the best apps are:  · The general aesthetics of the app. · Adherence to the provided mockups and design elements.  · Attention to the tiniest details in the user experience.  The smoothness of animations and the overall stability of the app will play a major role. Last but not least is the absence of significant flaws (including crashes, performance issues, battery drains, visual glitches, noticeable element blinking, layout imperfections and more).   Submissions Contestants will be able to submit their entries to @MyTonWalletBot. We will further clarify the submission instructions closer to the deadline. (forwarded from MyTonWallet · News)

Unknown: Smart contract libraries  TON smart contract developers, you can use smart contract libraries to optimize the network fees of your smart contract, in particular the storage and forward fees.  Libraries are applicable if you have multiple instances of a smart contract that have common data.  The common data (e.g. smart contract code) can be stored in the library, and the smart contract will only reference it.  You can find an example of how to use this functionality in the new Jetton-with-governance and Multisig 2.0 smart contracts.  Documentation »

Unknown: Efficiency of TON blockchain state storage  We would like to draw attention to the beauty of the TON architecture.  Even without libraries, serialized data in the blockchain is automatically compressed, which means that the same data cells are deduplicated.  This fits well with the guidelines of writing distributed smart contracts on TON - not to make a single huge smart contract that is a bottleneck, but to make many small actors. Identical cells of instances of the same smart contracts will be stored once, so the final blockchain state is not bloated.

Unknown: Introduction of precompiled smart contracts  New functionality will be introduced in the next node update.  The code of the most popular smart contracts can be written in C++ and embedded in node.  Since such precompiled smart contracts do not need to run TVM to execute, they consume less resources and therefore their network fees can be reduced.  It is planned to offer validators to apply this optimization to the new Jetton-with-governance smart contract.  Next step is introduction of refreshed Jetton smart contract code (fully compatible with the old Jetton of course) and propose to make it precompile as well.  In order for the precompile optimization to apply, validators need to vote for each smart contract type. Note, that precompiles can be activated step-wise: first by activating new cost rules and then by activating embedded code execution.   Documentation »

Unknown: Introducing new TVM opcodes for easy calculation of fees  New TVM opcodes was intoduced in 2024.04 update that allow you not to hardcode fees in Toncoins, but to dynamically calculate it in code.   You can find an example of how to use this functionality in the new Jetton-with-governance and Multisig 2.0 smart contracts.  Documentation »

Unknown: Reducing transaction costs — a guideline for developers — MUST READ  As you know the TON provides for the possibility of reducing the price of gas and message forwarding by a network-wide vote.  What developers need to know with this lowering transaction costs:  1) Current smart contracts where fees are hardcoded will not break, as there will be a decrease of gas/forward price, not an increase.  2) Please use new TVM opcodes in your smart contracts to dynamically calculate fees and do not hardcode fees in Toncoins in the smart contract code.  3) No one knows Toncoin future market dynamic. This means that after a decrease, after some time there may be a increase of transaction costs measured in TON.  Never hardcode fees in Toncoin at a reduced price in the smart contract code, otherwise your smart contract will break at a possible increase of gas price.  We can guarantee that the gas price will not be higher than the current price (as of April 16, 2024).

Unknown: ⚡️ Gasless USDT and Notcoin transfers in Tonkeeper  A month ago, Tonkeeper introduced a breakthrough 🔋Tonkeeper Battery feature that pays transactions fees when an account’s TON balance is zero. The Battery covers payments, staking, swaps and more with any tokens and NFTs. In just one month, Battery relayed almost 1,000,000 transactions covering over $100,000 in fees.  Today we are making a big step forward: ⚡️fast gasless payments in USDT⚡️. Users do not have to charge the Battery: transaction fees are paid directly from the USDT balance.  Gasless USDT transfers in Tonkeeper work 2x faster and 1.5x cheaper than in any other wallet. This is possible thanks to a new wallet architecture called 🔥W5 — an open wallet standard developed by Tonkeeper team to replace the existing standard version 4. 🔥W5 is available as beta release today in Tonkeeper on iOS and Android.  To try Gasless Transactions:  1. Update Tonkeeper to version 4.6.1  2. Tap “USDT” and select “Try W5 Wallet”  3. Add the “W5” wallet alongside a current wallet and send some USDT to it  4. Pay with USDT and Notcoin without TON!  To learn more about these new product features check out our next post: 👉 Tonkeeper Battery, Gasless and W5.  Download Tonkeeper: tonkeeper.com Follow: en · ru · فارسی · twitter (forwarded from Tonkeeper News)

Unknown: 🔋Tonkeeper Battery, ⚡️Gasless and 🔥W5  Main announcement 👉 t.me/tonkeeper_news/116  Learn how Battery, gasless transactions and wallet standard 🔥W5 help people onboard to the world of TON 👇  1️⃣ Have gas fees been removed from Tonkeeper?  No. The TON network charges a fee for every transaction, paid in Toncoins. Battery and Gasless are optional features that simplify paying the same fees without using Toncoins.  2️⃣ How do gasless transactions work?  When transferring USDT, Tonkeeper attaches a fee payment from the account’s USDT balance to the same transaction. Tonkeeper takes care of paying the TON fees behind the scenes.  3️⃣ Why do I need a new 🔥W5 wallet account?  🔥W5 enables efficient payment of fees that are 2x faster and cost less in fees compared to all other wallet apps that use the current standard version 4.  4️⃣ I already have charges in my Battery, can I use it?  Yes, the Battery balance in an existing wallet can be used to pay fees on the 🔥W5 wallet that uses the same recovery phrase.  5️⃣ Should I move all my funds to 🔥W5?  Do not move all funds. 🔥W5 is currently in beta and under development. The final version is coming in summer and may have a different address: users who tried 🔥W5 Beta may need to move funds again to the final version.  6️⃣ Why do I need the Battery if USDT can work without it?  The Battery is designed to cover all transactions with many different kinds of assets, including NFTs. Gasless only works with USDT and Notcoin because it’s not possible to pay fees with a fraction of an NFT and less popular tokens are more volatile or illiquid.   7️⃣ Supported features  Gasless: Transfers of USDT, jUSDT and Notcoin. Only available in 🔥W5 wallets. Battery: Transfers of all tokens, NFTs, swaps, both v4 and 🔥W5 wallets. Soon: Gasless swaps on 🔥W5, advanced NFT operations with Battery.

Unknown: Preparing for the new v5 version of wallet smart contract  As you know the Tonkeeper team is actively contributing to the development of the TON network. Its previous big contribution was the TON Connect protocol, which eventually became the unified protocol for applications and wallets in the TON network.  In this year, the Tonkeeper team has proposed a new v5-beta version of the wallet smart contract. In beta mode, Tonkeeper Wallet has launched support for this new version.   In addition to retaining the previous functionality (v4), the new contract allows you to send up to 255 messages at a time, as well as to make full-fledged gasless transactions (e.g. payment of network fees when transferring USDt in USDt itself) and other features.  Having studied the contract, we believe it will enhance the usability and capabilities for TON users.  The TON Core team is starting to audit and test this v5-beta smart contract. The smart contract code will change in the course of this work, but we will try to keep its interface intact. The TON Core team plan to complete this work by June 20.  We ask all wallets in the TON ecosystem to support the final smart contract after the audit.  UI:  — Already now wallet teams can start UI preparations. You can use the v5-beta smart contract as a test smart contract, but keep in mind that it will change.  — UI suggestion: wallets that have multi-accounts could support the new v5 smart contract as a separate account in the UI. Provide a “Transfer funds between your accounts” functionality.  Beta:  — If you build v5 functionality into public versions of your products - please mark it as “beta” and do not use v5 contract by default, but only when explicitly enabled in the settings. Please observe this rule to prevent too wide distribution of the non final beta version of the v5 smart contract.  Release:  — The final smart contract will be ready around June 20, after which wallets can enable v5 by default using the final smart contract.

Unknown: Preparing for gasless transactions  The v5 wallet smart contract allows the processing of internal messages signed by the owner.  This also allows you to make gasless transactions, e.g. payment of network fees when transferring USDt in USDt itself.  Flow:  1. When sending an USDt the user signs one message containing two outgoing USDt transfers:  1.1. USDt transfer to the recipient's address.  1.2. Transfer of a small amount of USDt in favor of the Service.  2. This signed message is sent offchain by HTTPS to the Service backend. The Service backend sends it to the TON blockchain paying Toncions for network fees.  The Tonkeeper team announced the launch of the beta version of such public backend on June 14. Backend will support the USDt and the NOT.  Although each wallet could launch its own backend, we believe that a single backend would be more convenient if there are network-wide subsidy campaigns. However, the final choice is up to you.  We invite TON wallets to support gasless transactions for USDt (and NOT) by June 20, by the time the v5 wallet smart contract is finalized.

Unknown: 🚀 Tact v1.3 release notes  The new Tact v1.3 release provides a massive improvement on the smart contract programming for TON blockchain.  🗺 Maps  Traversing a map has never been easier! The foreach loop for the Map type:  let mapLength: Int = 0; foreach (k, v in map) {   mapLength += 1; }   You don't have to use map.set(key, null) to remove a key from your maps, use the more intuitive del method instead: map.del(key).  Want to check if the map is empty? Use map.isEmpty()!  🔤 Strings   Strings finally support escape sequences, like \\, \", \n, \u0000 through \uFFFF, etc.  There is a new non-modifying StringBuilder's concat method for chained string concatenations: b = b.concat("Hello,").concat(foo).concat("Tact!").  We added the toString method for the Address type that you asked for numerous times in the dev chats: address("EQBKgXCNLPexWhs2L79kiARR1phGH1LwXxRbNsCFF9doc2lN").toString().  👌 Handling exceptions  Want to process various TVM and user-defined exit codes before your contract fails at runtime? The try and try-catch statements: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/statements#try-catch:   try {     let foo: Int = 42 / 0; } catch(e) {     // your division by zero handler }   ☀️ New quality-of-life improving syntax  Tact started supporting struct fields punning, i.e. {foo, bar} is syntactic sugar for { foo: foo, bar: bar }.  There is support for trailing commas in all comma-separated lists in Tact, here is how you can use it with structs:      foo(Struct {     field1: 42,     field2: "42",   })     You can now chain method calls with the unboxing operator !!, e.g. map.asCell()!!.hash().  For those missing some bit-level hackery, there is the bitwise XOR operator ^ available now.  ⚙️ Stdlib enhancements   The Tact team has added log2 and log, pow2 and pow functions.  Use reserve mode constants from @stdlib/reserve instead of their numeric values to make your code even easier to read: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve-base-modes.  🧠 Debugging  Debugging has become easier now as the dump() and dumpStack() functions now print the file path, line number, and column number in addition to the data specified by the programmer.  Addresses can be arguments of the dump function.  💻 Tact CLI  Tact's command line interface just became a lot more user-friendly: run npx tact --help from terminal and see what's available.  Just a highlight: CLI now allows compiling a single Tact file directly, without specifying a config file: npx tact your-awesome-contract.tact. It's very useful for quick experiments or bug reports.  🛠 Third-party tools support   For third-party tools implementors there is new improved APIs: AST traversals, access to the AST store of top-level items like functions, constants, traits, etc.  Happy hacking! ❤️  Check out Tact's CHANGELOG for the comprehensive list of features, changes and bugfixes.  Check out the Tact docs and read about the new Tact features.  To upgrade your Blueprint-based Tact projects to use Tact v1.3.1, run npm upgrade inside the project folder.  This release was brought to you by 0kenx, byakuren-hijiri, Max Korsunov, Novus Nota, Vitor Py, Daniil Sedov, and Anton Trunov.

Unknown: 🎉 Tact v1.5.0 has just been released  The new Tact release v1.5.0 just landed on NPM! Here are the highlights of the most important features.  🛠 New Tact features  asm functions allow you to access the deep dark corners of TVM for more features or better performance:    asm fun keccak256(s: Slice): Int {     1 INT HASHEXT_KECCAK256 }   asm functions have some limitations at this point and the Tact team will make them even more powerful in the next releases.  - A wider range of serialization options for integers can now be used, not just 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256-bit integers, but anything in between: uint1 through uint256 and int1 through int257. For instance, a 48-bit timestamp can be defined now if you'd like to build contracts that can work after the year 2038:   contract Contract {     timestamp: Int as uint48 }   - Constant definitions now support calls to user-defined functions and references to other constants:   const CONSTANT: Int =     myFunction(OTHER_CONSTANT)   👩‍💻 New builtin and stdlib functions and methods  - The exists method for the Map type: m.exists(key) which is equivalent to m.get(key) != null.  - The deepEquals method for the Map type: m1.deepEquals(m2) -- you can now easily compare two maps with the same key-value pairs and get true as the result, even if their internal representations are different, so the hash-based == comparison would return false.  - The toSlice method for structs and messages: struct.toSlice().  - The new slice, rawSlice, ascii and crc32 built-in compile-time functions to help you define constant integers and slices more conveniently.  - The new stdlib functions to help with fee calculations: gasConsumed, getComputeFee, getStorageFee, getForwardFee, getSimpleComputeFee, getSimpleForwardFee, getOriginalFwdFee, myStorageDue. This brings you access to the TVM instructions from 2023.07 and 2024.04 upgrades.  - The parseStdAddress and parseVarAddress stdlib functions allow you to parse slices into structured addresses.  🐞 The new release also includes a bunch of bugfixes. Thanks to all the Tacticians for all the issues you open!  📜 Full changelog for Tact v1.5.0: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#150---2024-09-15

Unknown: TON Mintless Jettons  Introducing the new TON Mintless Jetton technology. It is a jetton that can be instantly distributed to hundreds of millions of users on the TON blockchain, with network fees costing less than a dollar. The user's ownership of their coins is guaranteed by cryptography and a smart contract.  As an example, we created a test jetton called Mintless Points (for testing purposes only, no other value) and distributed it to 18 million wallets in the TON mainnet.  This jetton is compatible with regular jetton in TON. The only difference is that the smart contact is not created in advance, but during the user's first action.   Popular TON ecosystem products such as Tonkeeper, MyTonWallet, Tonviewer, Tonscan.org, TON API, DTON, Toncenter have announced that they will soon support Mintless Jetton technology.  We encourage all products and services in the ecosystem to consider integration as well.  On September 26, the famous game project Hamster Kombat will apply this technology during its coin giveaway. Considering Hamster Kombat's gigantic audience, this event has all chances to become the largest airdrop in the history of cryptocurrencies.  Description »  Standard »  Smart Contract »

Unknown: Mintless jettons support  TONAPI supports mintless jettons as a part of bigger standard for jettons with custom payload and init data.  When you are requesting jetton balances for an account and want to get mintless jettons transparently, you should use the custom_payload parameter in the supported_extension field in the request. For example, this link or direct jetton info this link:      {       "balance": "1000000000",       "wallet_address": {         "address": "0:405171f583a9e39e22ae9d8394769bc6e37299c59332012a51693b4d606780f3"       },       "jetton": {         "address": "0:fa67d0c7739331fbc3c8f08e018c65f47763616a969100ad760a0b2dc1e36832",         "name": "Mintless Points",         "symbol": "Points",         "decimals": 9,         "image": "https://cache.tonapi.io/imgproxy/DmmPn6dWmsmBgSMVbvjbhIDCChLWI3RmqDJ71whxYBA/rs:fill:200:200:1/g:no/aHR0cHM6Ly9pLmliYi5jby9TS010TlRHL21pbnRsZXNzLnBuZw.webp",         "custom_payload_api_uri": "https://claim-api.tonapi.io/jettons/EQD6Z9DHc5Mx-8PI8I4BjGX0d2NhapaRAK12CgstweNoMint"       },       "extensions": [         "custom_payload"       ]     }   How to Support Mintless Jettons in Your Dapp  1. Request balances with ?supported_extensions=custom_payload. 2. Check if data["extensions"] contains "custom_payload" for the jetton. 3. If it contains and you want to autoclaim on transaction, when your dapp asks the user to send an outgoing jetton transfer via TonConnect, request custom payload and state init via the API: https://tonapi.io/v2/jettons/0:fa67d0c7739331fbc3c8f08e018c65f47763616a969100ad760a0b2dc1e36832/transfer/UQBDaa8UGaMVKiT8TKXiaJqlyWLmx-MoHYvT_wzHEpdUnIss/payload. 4.

Unknown: More info on Mintless Jettons for developers  We are happy to announce that many ecosystem products such as Tonkeeper, MyTonWallet, Tonhub, Tonviewer, Tonscan, DeDust, Stonfi, Toncenter API, TON API and others have already supported Mintless.  Tomorrow there are planning the first use of the mintless jetton during the minting of the Hamster Kombat game project.  A few details for developers to be aware of:  1) When initially sending and simultaneously claiming a jetton, you must attach at least 0.1 TON to the transfer.  2) Airdrop for each user has two dates: date when it start to be claimable and deadline untill it should be claimed. Both can set individually for each user, but also can be the same for all users. For example for "Mintless Points" test jettons the deadline will expire tomorrow. HamsterCoins will start tomorrow and claiming deadline will expire in three years.

Unknown: Good news, everyone!  We are excited to announce the launch of our webhook service.  (Actually, there might still be some issues like delivery delays, but the API is stabilized.)   What is it and why do you need it?  TON is renowned for its scalability, meaning more transactions and blocks are added to the blockchain every second. In last year's stress tests, a record of 100,000 transactions per second was set. This means the blockchain generated over 100 megabytes of blocks per second or about a gigabit of incoming traffic if you want to view the entire blockchain. Of course, not every service needs to view all transactions in all blocks to find valuable insights.  To solve this problem, we are launching a webhook service that allows you to subscribe only to the data you need. Our service will attempt to deliver messages at increasing intervals until your server returns a 200 response.  Current subscription options:  1. Subscription to specific accounts - You can subscribe to a million accounts, and if a transaction occurs on any of them, we will notify you. Charges are based on the number of monitored account-days and each event.  2. Subscription to specific opcodes of incoming messages - If any account receives an incoming message with such an opcode, we will notify you. Up to 100 opcodes per account. Charges are based on the number of events.  3. Subscription to new accounts in the network - Don't require description. Charges only for the number of messages.  4. Subscription to the mempool - We send all externals we see before they are included in the blockchain. Charges for each sent message, and no retries. If your server was unavailable, we will not attempt to resend.  Try it!  Or read the docs first!  We welcome any feedback in comments to this post. (forwarded from Ton Console)

Unknown: FunC 0.4.6  In this release of FunC two compiler bugs were fixed. Both manifest in unusual conditions and scanning onchain history for last months didn't revealed any manifestation in the wild. So apparently existing contracts are safe thanks to culture of thorough integrational testing in developer community! Great job 👍  Still, if you are deploying a new contracts we recommend you to switch to new compiler version.  1) First bug is related to try/catch construction, where inside try branch a function that modifies c1/с3 is called. That may happen in case of non-trivial branching in this child function or using set_c3. How to check.  2) Second bug is related to storing function into variable. In this case, in FunC <=0.4.5 impure modifier of this functions was dropped.

Unknown: ⛏️ TON Space adds support for the TON test network  We’re excited to announce that developers can now test and build applications more quickly, all within Telegram. This was made possible by integrating the TON Testnet into TON Space 💎  ⛏ The test network (or testnet) is a separate blockchain where developers can safely implement updates without affecting the main network. This prevents potential instability on the main blockchain (also known as the mainnet or “core network”). Testnet allows updates to be thoroughly tested before deploying them to mainnet 🪙  Each application can have its own testnet, utilizing test tokens for transactions. You can get test TON here: @testgiver_ton_bot   Please note: Test tokens cost nothing and cannot be exchanged for real crypto. Testnet is only intended to be used by developers and beta testers 🫴  Developers and testers can switch between testnet and mainnet in their TON Space settings. Additionally, we've prepared a special link for developers to include in their applications, making it easier for QA teams and beta testers to switch between networks 🗺 (forwarded from TON Space News)

Unknown: Two months of absence: what was going on?  Two months have passed since the announcement of Tolk. You might be wondered, what was going on and why there we no releases yet.  Throughout all November, I've been working on the vision of the future. My goal was to "visualize" what Tolk v1.0 should look like. What's the language we're all targeting to, so that it solves lots of practical problems, avoids manual cells/slices manipulation, provides sufficient mechanisms for ABI generation, but still being zero overhead. I have created a giant roadmap (40 PDF pages!) describing the vision, and how, step by step, we're going to reach it.  Throughout all December, I've been constantly working on the compiler's kernel. As you know, Tolk is a fork of FunC. FunC compiler internals are very challenging to be extended and modified. The way FunC looks like is just a mirror of its internal implementation. Heading towards the future, I had to partially "untangle" this "legacy FunC core", so that in the future, it will be able to "interbreed" with features it was not originally designed for.  Currently I am done with this preparation. Tolk v0.7 has just been released. It contains a fully rewritten semantic analysis kernel (though almost invisible to the end user, huh).  ✅ Notable changes in Tolk v0.7: 1. Under the hood: refactor and revamp compiler internals. AST-level semantic analysis kernel 2. Under the hood: rewrite the type system from Hindley-Milner to static typing 3. Clear and readable error messages on type mismatch 4. Generic functions fun f<T>(...) and instantiations like f<int>(...) 5. The bool type 6. Type casting via value as T  PR on GitHub with detailed info. IDE plugins are updated accordingly.  BTW, a new version of blueprint was also released. You can now update compilers (Tolk / FunC / Tact) independently, they became peer dependencies.  P.S. I'll uncover the details about planned Tolk v1.0 quite soon. (forwarded from TOLK lang)

Unknown: 🔨Dev tools updates  Recently new versions of blueprint, sandbox, test-utils, and create-ton have been released. The most important (and breaking) change is the fact that since blueprint v0.28.0 compilers (func-js, tolk, tact) have become peer dependencies. This means that you can pick and choose any compiler version that you need, as long as its API is compatible with what blueprint expects, but this also means that you need to have them listed in your package.json. If you're creating a new project using create-ton, it will add compiler dependencies automatically. If not and if you're upgrading blueprint in an old project, you will have to install compilers yourself, you can use the template's package.json for reference.  Changes to sandbox and test-utils include better support for extra currencies, which might be of use due to the recent developments in TON. (forwarded from TonTech)

Unknown: Try 🔗 act.ghwnd.cc – a flexible no-code message constructor with TonConnect support  👀  With act, you can create and save a board with different messages for various contracts and sign them however you like – it can even be an admin panel for a contract (use it in testnet – it's meant for experiments, and we take no responsibility).  Key features: - act has a "bucket": create actions, add them to the bucket, and send them in batches of up to 4/255 actions at a time, depending on the wallet version; - duplicate actions; - duplicate cells, copy them in base64, and paste ready-made base64 cells into storeRef; - hide cells – makes navigation slightly more convenient; - when sending a token, you can quickly get the jetton wallet address of the connected wallet; - act includes templates to help you explore popular actions with links to documentation.  Check out this example of a swap on dedust to see how it all works. There's a video guide at the bottom.  🔗 act.ghwnd.cc (forwarded from ghwnd)

Unknown: Tolk v0.8: preparation for structures  A new version of Tolk was released several days ago. We're starting a way to eventually implement structures with auto packing to/from cells. This will take several steps (each publicly released), it's the first one.  ✅ Notable changes in Tolk v0.8: 1. Syntax tensorVar.0 and tupleVar.0, both for reading and writing 2. Allow cell, slice, etc. to be valid identifiers  PR on GitHub with detailed info.  Using syntax `tensorVar.{i}` and `tupleVar.{i}`, you can access tensors/tuples by indices without unpacking them.  It works for tensors:  var t = (5, someSlice, someBuilder);   // 3 stack slots t.0                     // 5 t.0 = 10;               // t is now (10, ...) t.0 += 1;               // t is now (11, ...) increment(mutate t.0);  // t is now (12, ...) t.0.increment();        // t is now (13, ...)  t.1         // slice t.100500    // compilation error   It works for tuples (does asm INDEX/SETINDEX under the hood):  var t = [5, someSlice, someBuilder];   // 1 tuple on a stack with 3 items t.0                     // "0 INDEX", reads 5 t.0 = 10;               // "0 SETINDEX", t is now [10, ...] t.0 += 1;               // "0 INDEX" to read 10, "0 SETINDEX" to write 11 increment(mutate t.0);  // also, the same way t.0.increment();        // also, the same way  t.1         // "1 INDEX", it's slice t.100500    // compilation error   It works for nesting var.{i}.{j}. It works for nested tensors, nested tuples, tuples nested into tensors. It works for mutate. It works for globals.  Why is this essential?  In the future, we'll have structures, declared like this:  struct User {     id: int;     name: slice; }   Structures will be stored like tensors on a stack:  var u: User = { id: 5, name: "" }; // u is actually 2 slots on a stack, the same as var u: (int, slice) = (5, "");  fun getUser(): User { ... } // on a stack, the same as fun getUser(): (int, slice) { ... }   It means, that `obj.{field}` is exactly the same as `tensorVar.{i}`:  var u: User = ...;   // u: (int, slice) = ... u.id;                // u.0 u.id = 10;           // u.0 = 10   Same goes for nested objects:  struct Storage {     lastUpdated: int;     owner: User; }  s.lastUpdated        // s.0 s.owner.id           // s.1.0   So, implementing indexed access for tensors/tuples covering all scenarios is a direct step towards structures.

Unknown: Improved Metadata API  Last month we started providing metadata for Jettons and NFTs in the V3 API.  We are pleased to report a number of improvements:  — The metadata now enters the API in advance as soon as the token appears on the network. In the previous implementation, the metadata was indexed the first time the token was requested.  — Images and JSON are now proxied via toncenter.com. 3 image sizes are available, as well as original non-proxied urls for JSON and images. IPFS is supported. Using a proxy increases security (you don't make requests to third-party hosting) and speed of downloading resources. (forwarded from Toncenter API)

Unknown: 🎉 Tact v1.6.0 is released!  🏆 This is the biggest update of Tact since its creation, bigger than all previous milestones combined. There were so many improvements that we've even won over FunC in terms of gas usage on many standard contracts, such as Jettons. 🤔 Don't believe me? 🥳 Let's unpack Tact v1.6.0 together and see these improvements for ourselves!  We'll start with the number one achievement of this release:  ⛽️ Gas optimization victory over FunC  Gas has long been a major pain point for Tact. Prior to v1.6.0, Tact's gas usage on many common contracts, such as Jettons, was far from ideal, requiring about 2.5 times gas of the FunC reference implementation.  But with Tact 1.6.0, those old gas-expensive days are long gone.  🤯 For example, a Tact rewrite of the reference FunC Jetton code consumes less gas for transfer, burn and discovery messages! 😎 So, expect to receive easy-to-use idiomatic Tact implementations of common contracts in the near future  Some of the things we did to achieve this: ▪️ Removed "system" cell — parent contract code is no longer stored in the system cell with all the child contract codes ▪️ Removed redundant address checks ▪️ Deprecated Deployable trait in favor of receive(){} ▪️ Introduced contract parameters as an alternative to init() function  And optimized compiler internals, many old and new functions in the stdlib:  🧰 Some of the standard library additions and changes  • Added specialized deploy and message functions for efficient on-chain deployments and non-deployment messages respectively • Many math functions, such as divc, mulShiftRightCeil, and others • More advanced functions, such as setGasLimit, setSeed, myCode, and others • Handy throwIf and throwUnless functions, which deprecated their "native" prefixed counterparts • Optimized emptyCell and emptySlice functions • Int.toString function now consumes up to 64% less gas • Int.toFloatString function now consumes up to 62% less gas  Added many functions for Cell, Slice and Builder types: •  Variable integer serialization types and the corresponding .load and .store functions of Slice and Builder types • Functions Slice.hashData and String.hashData for efficient hashes of data only • Functions for working with addresses: Slice.asAddress, Slice.asAddressUnsafe, contractHash, and a new BasechainAddress type its helper functions • ...and more!  🧳 More auxiliary things  • Basic let-destructuring of structs and Messages • Compile-time method ID expressions for getters and Message opcodes • The codeOf expression to get the code of child contracts • More map improvements and new methods, like replace and replaceGet • New augmented assignment operators &&=, ||=, >>= and <<= • Better error reporting for many cases • Generation of constants in TypeScript wrappers • The -w, --watch CLI flags for watching for changes and automatic recompilations • CLI for the Tact's TVM disassembler — unboc • Fixes of the compilation report • Fixes of the compiler's third-party API • Fixes of the internal infrastructure and code generation • Lots of other miscellaneous bug fixes and smaller enhancements • ...and documentation for all of that and beyond!  Besides, check out the updated Awesome Tact list and add your awesome projects, especially those using Tact in production!  ⚠️ Breaking changes  There are only two, and they're both pretty minor:  • Tact 1.6.0 replaces Context.bounced field with Context.bounceable, which tells whether the received message can bounce back or not. Previously, the bounced was useless since any bounced messages would be handled in a separate bounced() receiver.  • The enabledMasterchain option was removed from tact.config.json. Going forward, support of masterchain addresses is always enabled in Tact contracts.  ♥️ Special thanks goes to all the contributors and community members — without you there would be nothing. Let's keep building the future of smart contracts with ⚡️ Tact! 📜 See full release notes for Tact v1.6.0 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  🍲 we're beating the gas allegations with this one 🗣🗣🗣 ♨️ @tact_kitchen

Unknown: 🎉 Tact v1.6.1 is released!  👀 "Long" time no see — many tools have been updated to support the latest Tact versions, and we've prepared some quality-of-life additions and minor fixes.  A big release cannot exist without a follow-up patch. This patch mainly focused on polishing things in the internal infrastructure, standard library, and public APIs.  🛠 Bug fixes  ▪️ The multiple wildcard function parameters are now supported.  That is, the following works in v1.6.1:   trait WildThing {     // Using wildcards for parameter names     virtual fun assure(_: Int, _: Int): Bool {         return true;     } }  contract YouMakeMyHeartSing with WildThing {     // And then overriding them with concrete names     override fun assure(a: Int, b: Int): Bool {         return a + b == b + a;     } }  ▪️ Made calls to the .toCell() function on struct as a contract field handled correctly.   struct MyStruct { x: Int; y: Int; z: Int }  contract MyContract(myField: MyStruct) {     receive() {         // This works fine now:         self.reply(self.myField.toCell());     } }  🧰 Standard library additions and changes  • Added the StateInit.hasSameBasechainAddress() function, which is a gas-efficient way to check whether the given initial package corresponds to a specified address.  • Added the cashback() function to efficiently forward excess funds from an incoming message to the target address.  • All entities in Core libraries received documentation comments. Next time, we'll add missing doc comments for the standard libraries, i.e., everything imported using the import "@stdlib/..." syntax.  🧳 Some other changes:  • We've inlined the contract load functions, so the gas consumption of the benchmarked Jetton implementation in Tact is even smaller than that of its reference implementation in FunC.  • The TypeScript wrappers now produce bi-directional mappings of exit codes from their numbers to string descriptions and vice versa. Plus, the message opcodes are exported too.  • The .code infix is no longer added to the file names of the generated FunC, Fift, and disassembled Fift outputs. It was annoying to see it everywhere, so now it's only present on the compiled .boc files.  📜 See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.1 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  Besides, the tact.vim plugin for Vim 8+ and tact-sublime package for Sublime Text 3+ have been updated to support Tact v1.6.0 (and v1.6.1 too).  The Misti static analyzer has been updated to v0.7.0 and now supports Tact v1.6.0 and v1.6.1. See its full release notes.  Speaking of plugins and tools, we have another announcement to make — we're starting an alpha test of the tact-language-server: an official language server for Tact that can be used standalone or within a dedicated extension for VSCode and VSCode-based editors, such as VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf, and others.  Join the alpha squad and gain early access to great tooling: tact-language-server. If things are good, please give it a star and write a positive review. If they're not — open an issue, and we'll take a look!  🍲 cue the Tact type beat (sped up) ♨️ @tact_kitchen from the @ton_studio

Unknown: 𒀟 Tolk v0.9: nullable types, null safefy, control flow, smart casts  Tolk v0.9 introduces nullable types: int?, cell?, and T?, bringing null safety to your code. The compiler prevents using nullable values without checks, but thanks to smart casts, this feels smooth and natural.  ✅ Notable changes in Tolk v0.9:  1. Nullable types int?, cell?, etc.; null safety 2. Standard library updated to reflect nullability 3. Smart casts, like in TypeScript in Kotlin 4. Operator ! (non-null assertion) 5. Code after throw is treated unreachable 6. The never type  PR on GitHub with detailed info.  ✔ Nullable types and null safety  In FunC, null was implicitly assignable to any primitive type — too permissive. A variable declared as int could still hold null at runtime, leading to TVM exceptions if used incorrectly.  Tolk now forces you to explicitly mark nullable values. This aligns with TypeScript T | null and Kotlin, preventing unintended null usage.   value = x > 0 ? 1 : null;  // int?  value + 5;               // error s.storeInt(value);       // error  if (value != null) {     value + 5;           // ok     s.storeInt(value);   // ok }   * any type can be nullable: cell?, [int, slice]?, (int, cell)? * no more unexpected TVM exceptions due to null * at runtime, int? and cell? occupy just one stack slot — zero overhead  ✔ Smart casts (via control flow graph)  Once a nullable value is checked, the compiler automatically refines its type:  if (lastCell != null) {     // here lastCell is `cell`, not `cell?` }   or:  if (lastCell == null || prevCell == null) {     return; } // both lastCell and prevCell are `cell`   or:  var x: int? = ...; if (x == null) {     x = random(); } // here x is `int`   Smart casts ensure code is safe while remaining gas-efficient (compile-time only).  ✔ Operator `!` (non-null assertion)  If you know a value can't be null, use the ! operator to bypass nullability checks:  // this key 100% exists, make it `cell`, not `cell?` validators = getBlockchainConfigParam(16)!;   It's useful for low-level TVM functions (dicts, particularly), when you have guarantees outside the code. Use with care!  ✔ The `never` type  Now, you can declare "always-throwing functions":  fun alwaysThrows(): never {     throw 123; }  fun f() {     ...     alwaysThrows();  // no return needed after this }   never also occurs implicitly when a condition is impossible:  var v = 0; // compiler warning: `int` can never be `null` if (v == null) {     // v is `never` }   ... this is just the beginning! Nullable tensors, tricky smart casts, and low-level null safety details — all explained in the PR.  🌳 Null safety is smooth, intuitive, and enforced at compile time — no runtime cost, no extra gas, just safer code.

Unknown: During the last year all dTON services were running on kubernetes cluster without HA build. Sometimes when we lost servers, we faced complex problems.  To improve the stability and availability of the service we developed high availability dTON cluster that will continue to work even if some of the servers are unavailable. Additionally, we've got setup complex monitoring and alerting system on services and data consistency.   Today we managed to switch all our services to HA cluster.   In our article we want to share our experience of HA cluster on top of bare-metal servers in three parts:  - dTON Kubernetes High Availability Transition - dTON LiteServers High Availability Transition - dTON GraphQL High Availability Transition  Second and third part will be posted exclusively on @dtontech with promo codes on dTON API usage.  https://blog.dton.io/dton-kubernetes-high-availability-transition-part-1/ (forwarded from dTON Tech)

Unknown: 🫧 Tolk v0.10: preparing for serialization — intN, bytesN, coins  This update lays the foundation of future auto-packing to/from cells by solving one critical question:  How should fields be serialized?  ✅ Notable changes in Tolk v0.10:  1. Fixed-size integer types: int32, uint64, etc. 2. Type coins and function ton("0.05") 3. Types bytesN and bitsN (backed by slices at TVM) 4. Replace "..."c postfixes with stringCrc32("...") functions 5. Trailing comma support  PR on GitHub with detailed info.  ❓ Fixed-size integers? In TVM? What?  Imagine Tolk already has structures, and we define an incoming message:  struct CounterIncrement {     counter_id: int;     inc_by: int; }   A client sends this message following the TL/B schema:  counterIncrement      counter_id:int32      inc_by:int64     = CounterIncrement;   But how do we tell the compiler that counter_id is int32 and inc_by is int64? This information is missing in the struct definition.  ✖ Rejected approaches: why they fail  Several syntax ideas were considered:   // type casting? counter_id: int as int32;  inc_by: int as int64;  // inline annotations? counter_id: int @int32; inc_by: int @int64;  // annotations above fields? @serialize(int32) counter_id: int; @serialize(int64) inc_by: int;   Each of these quickly breaks down when handling more complex cases.   For example, how would we handle TL-B Maybe int32? Would we write:  // this? inc_by: (int as int32)?; // or this? inc_by: int? as int32?; // or this? inc_by: Maybe<int> as Maybe<int32>;   And what about TL/B Both (Maybe int32) int64?  // this? my_data: Both<Maybe<int as int32>, int as int64>; // or this? my_data: Both<Maybe<int>, int> as Both<Maybe<int32>, int64>; // or how??   With every new case, the syntax becomes more complex, ambiguous, and error-prone.  ✔ The solution: `int32` as a first-class type   struct CounterIncrement {     counter_id: int32;     inc_by: int64; }   No annotations. No confusing as syntax. No ambiguity.  This scales perfectly:  struct MyMsg {     inc_by: int32?;     my_data: (int32?, int64); }   These are distinct types. A variable can be int32 and similar:  var op: int32 = ...; var query_id: uint64 = ...;   This makes serialization predictable, structured, and error-free.  ✔ What about overflow?  A reasonable question: what happens if a value exceeds the limit?  var v: uint8 = 255; v += 1;    // ???   Answer: no runtime overflow or clamping! It's just int at TVM.  * arithmetic works normally – v becomes 256 * no extra gas cost – no runtime bounds checks * overflow will only happen at serialization   struct Resp {     outValue: uint8; }  resp.outValue = v;   // 256 resp.toCell();       // a runtime "overflow" error   ✔ Why is this the best approach?  Think of smart contracts as a black box: - inputs are encoded (int32, uint64, etc.) - inside the contract, arithmetic uses full 257-bit precision - outputs are serialized again — overflow happens only at this stage  This is similar to how mulDivFloor(x,y,z) uses 513-bit precision internally. Your contract keeps precision internally and only enforces constraints at the border with an outside world.  🌳 Tolk will follow a type-based philosophy  This post covered the foundation of automatic serialization. The right way is to have a rich type system. Having nested types, having generics, having aliases — will allow to describe every practical TL/B case, but at a language level.  In v0.10, we introduce intN (fixed integers), bytesN (definite slices), coins (variadic integers), and some more additions. Read the details in the PR.  How will Either L R and even more complex TL/B structures be expressed?  Stay tuned for the next update... (forwarded from TOLK lang)

Unknown: 🎉 Tact v1.6.5 is released!  Back with another round of refinements! While we're working on many exciting things in the background, we're committed to fixing every bug that the community might discover so that Tact can provide a flawless developer experience.  Furthermore, we now actively employ AI and large language model (LLM) fuzzing techniques, such as documentation-driven approaches where LLMs are given only the Tact language documentation and access to the compiler. Then, LLM agents generate potentially problematic code snippets, compile them, and analyze results. They further iterate and provide new, interesting bug reports — resolving those makes both Tact compiler and Tact documentation better at the same time!  Check out this awesome article from one of the team members to learn more: Documentation-Driven Compiler Fuzzing with Large Language Models.  And now, let's see what's new in Tact v1.6.5, starting with the most prominent part of this patch release:  🛠 Bug fixes  • Ternary operator ?: now correctly works with structs and null values • New parser now properly handles the code that wasn't completed at the end of the file • The error for assembly functions and the get attribute is now correctly shown • Now, when you call the dump() function with an argument of the unsupported StringBuilder type, the error will always be shown even if the debug mode is disabled • Improper whitespace between the operator and the equals sign is no longer allowed • The &&= and ||= augmented assignment operators are now properly short-circuited • Get methods now can return an optional contract state • The Struct.fromSlice(), Message.fromSlice(), and similar functions now work properly if the slice has been parsed entirely and the  last field of the struct had the serialization annotation as remaining • The wildcard symbol _ is prohibited for struct and message struct fields, function names, contract, and trait names • The contract's state is now properly saved on early return statements in the receiver functions  🧳 Miscellaneous improvements  • Whenever you access context().sender, it now calls the sender() function instead to optimize the gas usage • The internalExternalReceiversOutsideMethodsMap option and its respective receiver order optimization were reworked to ensure compatibility with explorers and user wallets • The SendPayGasSeparately constant was deprecated in favor of SendPayFwdFeesSeparately — they're functionally identical, but the latter better expresses the intent and action that this optional flag makes when sending messages • The Stoppable trait now throws the exit code 133 instead of the exit code generated by the require() function from the "Contract stopped" message  📜 See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.5 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  LLMs are great, but we value our community no less. It's great being around a bunch of talented, passionate, and bright engineers who make a future of safe and scalable ⚡️ Tact smart contracts on TON possible for everyone. Thank you for everything you do and for the feedback you give!  A special shoutout goes to the RSquad team @rsquadlife for their early adoption of Tact features, thoughtful suggestions, and bug reports. If punk were code, they'd be its maintainers 🤘  🍲 ghibli deez bugs ♨️ @tact_kitchen from the @ton_studio

Unknown: Tracking Transactions on TON Just Got Easier! 🎉  Tracking external transactions (external-in) on the TON blockchain was challenging for all of us due to minor metadata differences.  Now TonAPI solves this with the normalized hash. With this method, tracking transactions is simple and reliable.  We've prepared clear examples to get you started: - Tracking transactions from TonConnect for dApps - Tracking manually constructed external messages  See code examples →  We’re excited to share this improvement, and soon more ecosystem tools will support it too! (forwarded from Ton Console)

Unknown: Toncenter API supported hash of a normalized external message  API V3 (Index):  - hash_norm field added to the Message structure. If the field is not present, it means this message not an external message, or the normalized hash_norm is equal to the regular hash.  - All methods with msg_hash parameter search also by normalized hash.  API V2:  - api/v2/sendBocReturnHash returns the normalized hash in addition to the normal hash. (forwarded from Toncenter API)

Unknown: 🫧 Tolk v0.11: type aliases, union types, and pattern matching  This update might confuse you at first. You may wonder: "Why do we need this? How will it be useful?". But in the end, you'll see how everything comes together bringing seamless and generalized message handling.  ✅ Notable changes in Tolk v0.11:  1. Type aliases type NewName = <existing type> 2. Union types T1 | T2 | ... 3. Pattern matching for types 4. Operators is and !is 5. Pattern matching for expressions 6. Semicolon for the last statement in a block can be omitted  PR on GitHub with detailed info.  ✔ Type aliases  Tolk now supports type aliases, similar to TypeScript and Rust.   type UserId = int32; type MaybeOwnerHash = bytes32?;   An alias creates a new name for an existing type but remains interchangeable with it. No performance overhead — a compile-time feature.  ✔ Union types `T1 | T2 | ...`  They now allow a variable to hold multiple possible types.    fun whatFor(a: bits8 | bits256): slice | UserId { ... }  var result = whatFor(...);  // slice | UserId   Nullable types T? are now formally T | null.   At the TVM level, union types work as tagged unions — similar to Rust enums but more flexible.  ✔ Pattern matching  The only way to work with union types is matching them:   match (result) {     slice  => { /* result is slice here  */ }     UserId => { /* result is UserId here */ } }   Matching is based on smart casts — inside each branch, the variable is automatically narrowed to the matched type.   It can also be used as an expression:   type Pair2 = (int, int); type Pair3 = (int, int, int);  fun getLast(tensor: Pair2 | Pair3) {     return match (tensor) {         Pair2 => tensor.1,         Pair3 => tensor.2,     } }   So, `match` + smart casts are our way for union types. You may notice that it's close to enums in Rust. But we don't have enum. Union types are more general and powerful.  ✔ `match` for expressions   val nextValue = match (curValue) {     1 => 0,     0 => 1,     else => -1 };   As you see, match also works for constant expressions, similar to switch in other languages.  ✔ Union types and TL/B `Either`  T1 | T2 will be directly mapped to TL-B (Either T1 T2).  Look how clean this is: (Either SmallPayload LargePayload) becomes   struct StoragePart {     data: SmallPayload | LargePayload;     // (de)serialized as '0' + ... or '1' + ... }  match (s.data) {     SmallPayload => ...     LargePayload => ... }   No need to manually handle bits from the slice — it's naturally expressed in the type system!  ✔ Union types and TL/B constructors  T1 | T2 | ... is a typed way to describe multiple constructors from TL/B. Generally, they can be used anywhere inside a storage or a message.   Moreover — handling incoming messages is beautifully expressed with union types.  ✔ Union types and future structures  The ultimate goal? You'll describe each incoming message as a struct, create a union type for them, parse a slice, and just match over variants:   // don't mind about opcodes yet struct CounterIncBy { byValue: int32 } struct CounterReset {} struct ... other messages  type IncomingMessage = CounterIncBy | CounterReset | ...;  // ... after parsing a message match (msg) {     CounterIncBy => {         newCounter = curCounter + msg.byValue     }     CounterReset => {         newCounter = 0     }     ... }   🌳 So, union types (that perfectly work with tensors) will seamlessly work with structures. With union types, you will declare both Either and different kinds of messages. Combined with intN and other types, they will allow to express (almost) any practical TL/B construction. They are not limited to message routing — in other words, message routing does not differ from handling any field, any storage, or any cell in general. (forwarded from TOLK lang)

Unknown: 🎉 Tact v1.6.6 is released!  The final patch release of this v1.6 series is upon us, and it brings a significant tooling improvement, amongst other things. Meet the official Tact formatter — a new tool that ensures consistent code style across your Tact projects. It ships with Tact v1.6.6, and you can run it in your projects via npx tact-fmt or by invoking a format command in your editor. You'd need to install the Tact's language server or the VSCode extension for that — see the tact-language-server repo for details.  The v1.6.* series of patches has been a journey of refinement and polish, setting the stage for what's coming next. As we close this chapter, we're already working hard on exciting new features for the future.  For now, let's explore the Tact v1.6.6 release:  🧰 Standard library additions and changes  • Added compute phase exit code constants reserved by the Tact compiler, such as TactExitCodeNullReferenceException (128) and many others.  • Added the SignedBundle struct and the corresponding verifySignature method.  • Added sendRawMessage and sendRawMessageReturnForwardFee functions as replacements for their deprecated counterparts.  • Optimized the sha256() function to about ~270 less gas used per call and added the keccak256() function that works with arbitrarily long slices.  🛠 Bug fixes  There were a lot of those. Remember that last time we started fuzzing the compiler with LLMs to root out bugs? Well, we found many bugs that way and fixed even more — many error messages got way more informative and useful. Some bug fixes allowed for seemingly unrelated UX improvements too.  One nice example of a second-order fix would be that the require() function now supports constants as its second parameter. You no longer need to provide identical string literals everywhere — define a string constant somewhere and reuse it!  See the full release notes for a long list of bugs squished and error messages improved.  ✍️ Documentation updates  • Added a "Learn Tact in Y minutes" page, which gives a whirlwind code-first tour of the Tact language.  • Any AI vibe coders out there? The docs now generate llms.txt, llms-full.txt and llms-small.txt files for you to use with your AIs. The small version is particularly interesting as it fits in the 200k context.  • The "gas best practices" page got updated with new recommendations, such as specialized math functions or the BasechainAddress struct and related functions.  • Lots of examples fixed, with more fixes to arrive as we speak.  🧳 Formatter!  You can run it via npx tact-fmt in your projects — it supports checking the formatting via the --check flag, applying fixes via the --write flag, and can check both individual files and directories of files.  Furthermore, it also ships with our official language server and VSCode extensions. See the tact-language-server's README.md for installation details.  📜 See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.6 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  In about 4 days from now, on April 21 at 12:00 (UTC+3), the Tact Smart Battle will begin! It is the ultimate smart contract challenge powered by Tact and organized by TON Studio & Codeforces. The prize pool is $20,000 in Toncoin, and the top 128 participants will receive exclusive Soulbound Tokens (SBTs). Moreover, the best battlers will be invited for job interviews at TON Studio.
