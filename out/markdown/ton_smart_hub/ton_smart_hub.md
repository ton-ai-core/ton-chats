Nikita: https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint (reply to 62)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Personally I prefer https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template

/B4ckSl4sh\: It is only for Tact but I like it more than blueprint (reply to 66)

Randolph: GM

Ackermann: No just tact (reply to 113)

Игорь: Language for TON Smart Contracts (reply to 114)

Unknown: Guysss !) (reply to 28)

Игорь: ну мало ли, за спрос не бьют, и FunC быстрее (reply to 119)

Phin: Online ofc (reply to 233)

Classifiedweb3: Hello everyone

Andrey: Is using asm allowed and good practice or we must use only Tact?

Phin: ONLY tact. Its TACT smart battle dude (reply to 262)

X1ag: but on tact we can use func & fift xd (reply to 264)

X1ag: asm functions can be writen on tact (reply to 262)

Anton: you can use anything that compiles and passes the tests  `asm`-functions are part of Tact, so it’s definitely legal  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/assembly-functions (reply to 262)

Anton: you might also want to check out this page: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/gas-best-practices/

Digital: Hi guys . Could anyone answer why I should prefer Tact over FunC? What are the benefits of the language?

Digital: What is the strategy of Tact language? Seems like it’s going to be a wrapper for cross chain development

Digital: Is it ?

E2BIG: My mental model to compare of  them is similar to C++ and C  Tact is a higher level language, easier to use and harder to shoot yourself in the leg. The team also claims it to be more gas efficient thanks to lower-level compiler optimizations (reply to 361)

Digital: Ok thanks 👍 (reply to 381)

Digital: So , the main strategy is gas spending efficiency

Digital: Right ?

Digital: Convince of coding is a matter of taste

E2BIG: I think mostly - developer experience, because for a very long time Tact was less much gas efficient than Func

Digital: But gas spending efficiency sounds better

Digital: Ok

Digital: Good luck guys !

E2BIG: If you feel adventurous, there’s another alternative language - Tolk  https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/overview

Digital: I’m just learning development on Ton and want to know all available options

Digital: Anyway having alternatives is a good think for evolution of Ton

Tochukwu🦊🐼🐈: Hi

Tochukwu🦊🐼🐈: Good morning sir

Manas Kumar: I want to earn money

Anton: - Open-source and open development: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact. - Fast, gas-efficient, and developer-friendly - Tact offers automatic serialization and deserialization of incoming and outgoing messages and structs: about 30% of production code consists of handling this issue. - Convenient work with maps: lots of built-in methods and easy map traversals with the foreach loop. - Support for sending messages: convenient handling of child contracts which is ubiquitous in TON smart contracts. - Rich and heavily-optimized standard library. - Automatically generated TypeScript wrappers to test, deploy and interact with smart contracts. - Superb tooling:   - Tact language server with lots inlay hints and security and performance suggestions.   - Online IDE: https://ide.ton.org.   - Misti – Static Analyzer for Extra Safety: https://github.com/nowarp/misti     - Source code formatter tact-fmt - Excellent documentation:   - Learn Tact in Y Minutes: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/learn-tact-in-y-minutes.   - Gas Optimizations: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/gas-best-practices.   - Security Best Practices: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/security-best-practices. - Secure & battle-tested – Tact compiler has been audited by Trail of Bits, a leading web3 security firm. - Proven in production – 33% of deployed mainnet contracts use Tact. - AI-friendly: tact-template with carefully crafted AI prompts. (reply to 361)

Digital: So Tact is : - user friendlier  - more gas spending efficient  - more secure (reply to 535)

Digital: Got it

Anton: and way better docs and tooling! (reply to 553)

Digital: Are there a roadmap or something like this of Tact? (reply to 535)

Anton: There is no public roadmap yet (something big will land by the end of Q2 2025). The Tact team occasionally posts some previews in the @tact_kitchen channel (reply to 589)

Digital: I will explore that . Thank you! (reply to 596)

Aditya: how can earn Ton any body can help me and guide me

Vishal: can we participate using cpp ? or are there any languauge restrictions like kotlin heroes

Samyar: this is smart contract development challenge with Tact   i'm not sure if there are libraries in cpp but i guess tact would be the best choice (reply to 651)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Not actually. On TON you usually don’t spend much gas. So the only thing matters is that Tact is easier to grasp. And you spend less time to decide how to use the language rather focus on your own business logic.   It’s somehow a way to make it easier for Solidity devs. (reply to 553)

Farhad Seyfullazada: I would say tact is very very very useful for developers. FunC is great but it is too hard to have many devs around globe being building sophisticated projects on func

Digital: I think FunC is not difficult to learn. If you understand how TVM works then everything else is easy. But of course during blockchain evolution smart contract codes tends to bloat which is a good reason to use a language like Tact. We’ll see. Anyway I’m gonna spend some time to learn that as well just to see its capabilities (reply to 659)

Digital: In my opinion TON is doing right steps to mass adoption, and spending time to learn development there is a good investment

Slava: I would say very awkward steps, but we are getting there :) (reply to 662)

Billyone: I'm new to blockchain development, I've been learning Solidity and I've made good progress because of the love I have for TON. That's why I want to learn Tact. Is there a way I can find video tutorials on the Tact programming language?

Unknown: 📚 Resources for Tact  1. Awesome Tact: Curated list of resources for learning the Tact language — Awesome Tact  2. Dev chats: List of Dev chats.  3. Tact 2023 Course: Detailed Tact Language Course — Tact 2023 Course  4. Tact by Examples: Sample code on Tact — Tact by Examples (reply to 744)

Billyone: What I also want to know is, does Tact support Foundry? (reply to 745)

Arjyadeep: Hmm

Unknown: Yes! Tact has experimental support for Foundry (reply to 749)

Billyone: I'm sorry for disturbing you  This video tutorial is in Russian. Is there any way I can find an English version?" (reply to 755)

Unknown: Sorry bro 🙏  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ5rEj25H3U2P5qp7nsgVtNGYxEojnnez&si=K8HbKUZKNbQYmm_f (reply to 758)

Vladimir: Registration guide: Notion link (reply to 1168)

Vladimir: 👆 (reply to 28)

Farhad Seyfullazada: ChatGPT does not have the knowledge to help with FunC or Tact 😁 have you ever tried to get help from it? (reply to 28)

Евгений: so that means you can copypaste 100% solution from github if it's already posted? (reply to 28)

🍌Titty: Code submission will be on tact language?

🍌Titty: Im comfortable in c++

Unknown: Check this link. (reply to 1249)

Oluwasegun Afolabi: Thank you. (reply to 1250)

Vladimir: There no solutions. It means that you can use open source contracts if it helps you with tasks (reply to 1238)

Adarsh: capcha image provided by testgiver ton bot is not downloading , is there any other way to get test ton coins

mohamed: how can i make ton wallet to participate on tact contest

Unknown: ( @wallet ) (reply to 1266)

mohamed: and i would ask each person who are between 1 ->128 will take 20000$ or 20000$are divide to 128 person?

Алексей: Yeah, also kinda intrested what is the prize distribution :)

Slava: This is a very poor motivation if you are entering a contest for money.

Vladimir: Quick answer for now (reply to 1268)

Алексей: Why you even made a prize fund then, and advertise it with $20k in marketing materials? 🤔 (reply to 1272)

Алексей: Make then no prize fund at all, if you think this is poor motivation

Я̨kov: Let's not go that far :)  I think the original intent was to say that the contests, when made well, are interesting on their own: to challenge yourself, to compete against others, to exercise your mind. And having the solid prize pool is a nice addition on top! (reply to 1276)

Spite: You can't decide that. Everyone has their own motivation. The main thing is that the competition fulfilled the main task for which it was designed - attracting new developers (reply to 1272)

Spite: And going to a contest just for the money is not a bad motivation. If a person has a job, then they need to figure out how to set priorities. And this is just one example

Unknown: ❗️❗️❗️ (reply to 28)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Isn't this init state problematic? if two people somehow (chance is near to zero but still not zero) deploy a smart contract with the same proposalId and votingEndingAt then they both would have the same contract. I know it is not worth to consider for the contest (reply to 1387)

Farhad Seyfullazada: i mean the first one

Jai Narayan: Heyyyy all

Dmitry: there is any limitations for using Assembly functions?

/B4ckSl4sh\: No (reply to 1407)

Vladimir: We don't deploy onchain contracts. Only local development and testing (reply to 1397)

Farhad Seyfullazada: To run a specific test you need to:  npm run test1 # for problem 1

Алексей: I guess this part should be deleted

Grit: Hey Guys! What is the max score per task? We better have it for the reference. For the first task in particular, what is the max score?

Kamil (Камиль): I think it’s 100, according to this: https://github.com/ton-studio/tact-smart-battle?tab=readme-ov-file#-scoring-breakdown (reply to 1430)

Grit: Oh, thanks Kamil' I've overlooked it (reply to 1431)

E2BIG: Scary low-level explanation of how to optimize block size in the blockchain (reply to 1445)

E2BIG: Ah, a misread the screenshot, there was another block that seems to be removed now (reply to 1447)

Sunny: Check carefully 🤝 (reply to 1449)

Иван: Do I understand it correctly, that in problem B the Vote message should not return the excess back to the sender (as nowhere stated about it)?

としあき: What was corrected? The problem statement is long and I don't see the difference at first glance. (reply to 1529)

Иван: after correction I've got 17/18, if you reread the task  carefully, but still 1 test is failed. (reply to 1527)

Anton: This part:  9. If someone tries to impersonate the ProposalMaster contract, the Proposal contract should throw exit code 2025. (reply to 1531)

Anton: Added a new bullet point

mohamed: to tact

mohamed: and i copy tact code and also compailaiton error

mohamed: what should i do

Евгений: learn tact (reply to 1543)

Иван: are there any requirements for the message, with which  Proposal child should be deployed (like the child deploy message should be DeployNewProposal), or this can be any message? (reply to 1534)

mohamed: the first problem is easy or not

Я̨kov: Consider writing the Tact code yourself :)  You can use this page as a reference of Tact: Learn Tact in Y minutes For more specific info, refer to the links on that page and to the Reference documentation for the standard library of Tact   Good luck! (reply to 1543)

としあき: I got 17/18 but I have no clue where the final error lies

Иван: the same thing for B (reply to 1549)

Anton: As far as I can see there is such requirement in the problem statement (reply to 1546)

としあき: How does deployment with extra data work? I put the DeployNewProposal message in the body of the DeployParameters, but should I do some checks in the Proposal's receive(DeployParameters) to make sure votingEndingAt isn't set multiple times?

Иван: not quite: To deploy a new voting proposal the ProposalMaster contract must accept messages of the DeployNewProposal message type: The Proposal contracts need to be initialized with zero vote counts upon deployment. But nothing said about the deploy message from ProposalMaster to Proposal (reply to 1551)

Anton: yep, this is what I meant (reply to 1553)

Anton: it’s up to you

としあき: No examples in the tect docs use deployment with extra data in the deployment message that's not part of the init state

としあき: it would be nice to have a better test suite available to check what's actually going wrong, but I guess that's part of the challenge...

𝐻𝒾𝓉𝒶𝓈𝓅("⁧ ;(": same,  #1: OK [46ms, 0MB]: task2 Tests completed 17/18 Score: 0.00 Total score: 0.00 (reply to 1532)

Salty: How are points calculated? Is it related to speed? Length of the code? Or something else? Thx

としあき: But wait, there's a rule "If someone tries to impersonate the ProposalMaster contract, the Proposal contract should throw exit code 2025." The only way someone could try to impersonate ProposalMaster when talking to Proposal is by deploying it. And if you have a rule, that means you're going to test it. That means your test suite is going to try to deploy the Proposal contract directly, without going through ProposalMaster. That means your test suite is going to send the deploy message to Proposal. That means the structure of the deploy message from ProposalMaster to Proposal is indeed important. (reply to 1555)

pennione: is this a rated round?

pennione: please tell?

Oleg: Please, read about scoring system (reply to 1559)

pennione: ? (reply to 1561)

Я̨kov: No (reply to 1561)

pennione: okaie

Oleg: Are you sure you didn't miss the updated part? (reply to 1558)

としあき: What does that even mean? Could you give a concrete example of an interaction that should result in a 2025 code? (reply to 1567)

Dmitry: In problem B, is this struct correct?   struct ProposalInit {     master: Address;     proposalId: Int as uint32; }

Dmitry: I don't see votingEndingAt here

としあき: yes, votingEndingAt is not part of the init struct because the init struct is used to identify the contract, and votingEndingAt is not needed to identify it

としあき: I implemented that, but after turning it off I still get 17/18 so I guess that part must be what's wrong. But I don't know how how I should make it correct. (reply to 1567)

Dmitry: hm, so how can we pass it to the Proposal contract in that case? (reply to 1572)

Aakib: Hi everyone! I am a newbie for tact language.  I've implemented the solution for problem 1 and getting 13/14. the checks added to through exception are: 1. voting after votingEndingAt is not considered. 2. vote after 100 successful voting isn't considered 3. voting again is not allowed Can anyone help me the potential checks i am missing. I amn't able to solve next questions as those are based on this. Any help would be deeply appreciated.

Daniel: Are you sure? That would mean it's possible to cheat, no? (reply to 2481)

Виталий: It is more than 30. But is still very small

Aakib: how can we throw custom exit codes? like 2025 for problem B

Yaroslaw: nativeThrow (reply to 2504)

Anton: throw(2025)  throwIf(2025, condition)  throwUnless(2025, condition) (reply to 2504)

Anton: this one is deprecated, but yeah, works too (reply to 2505)

Yaroslaw: so tired with 21/23 on D :((

Crypto: question E. I failed in the last sample. I think there is no problem with the performance. Could it be because I didn't handle 11.12 correctly? Are these two conditions

Yaroslaw: probably  I have the same error (reply to 2509)

Yaroslaw: 2 submissions on A, 4 on B, 5 on C, 28 on D  that's not ok (reply to 2508)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Any tips to optimise code and get more points ?

Fedor: I used to be at 21/23, now I am at 22/23. If I remember correctly, making sure that I correctly refund from every master receiver and proposal receiver helped me to pass the test (reply to 2508)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Idk what to work on will get me more points, i tried optimizing gas it only helped me to increase 1-2 points

Yaroslaw: ASM (reply to 2513)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Assembly in tact is way harder then that in solidity (reply to 2516)

Vladimir: There is no such statement that they will check this exactly by tests. It is just the point of task conditions  In fact, it is impossible to check this point directly by tests just making 4b votes, so it’s not a mistake of the team. Otherwise this test will run many hours (you can check time even this 10k). But, there is statement about storage, that can be checked way easier and what can handle many cases about storing data in one contract. Of course, in such situation there’s way to mislead tests, but I assume that the jury team will check this cases manually (reply to 2482)

Crypto: Will this trigger the receive of another contract func？

VH: - The system will automatically select your highest scoring solution for each task and use it in the final leaderboard.

VH: can the system use the last instead of highest?

VH: with current weak pretest highest wont be the final solution

VH: I think almost top 30 will be kicked out due to the temporary top score game of C and E

Виталий: there are no system tests after contest (reply to 2526)

VH: oh

VH: ok thank you, so I'll continue the top score game 😂

VH: even though I'm sure most top scores of C and E arent the intended solution

VH: or even correct solution

Crypto: messages？？

Sasha: True! Solved 3 tasks at the moment. Each time I faced n/N, I just search this chat or look at all pictures, and I find some hint. Thanks all folks here! (reply to 2545)

Sasha: Also Tact by example and tact documentation is very helpful

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: whats the thing about the capped score ?

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: many have scored more then that

Kinda Bad Music: only one more

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: even my total is greater than 1000

Kinda Bad Music: did you solve the E (reply to 2561)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: yup (reply to 2562)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: ohh thanks (reply to 2563)

Kinda Bad Music: was it just gas management? (reply to 2564)

Vladimir: 📢 Clarification on Scoring in Tact Smart Battle  We’re aware that some participants have explored ways to pass the tests without fully implementing all the requirements stated in the task descriptions. That’s on us — some test cases didn’t cover all possible edge scenarios, and we appreciate your creativity in finding those gaps.  🔹 That said, we confirm the following:   📊 Final score will be determined solely based on the results of the available test cases.   Your position on the leaderboard directly reflects the number of points earned through passing these tests.  This decision ensures transparency and fairness for all participants.  ❗️Important:   This does not exempt submissions from checks for plagiarism and independent work. Any violations in that regard may still result in disqualification.  Thank you to everyone who’s competing honestly and helping make this format better. You are the core of this community. 🔥  Useful links: - CodeForces: Challenge - Docs: tact-lang.org - Registration guide: notion link - Github repository: tact-smart-battle

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: yes (reply to 2566)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: check docs you will find it

Kinda Bad Music: ok but then we can use the same trick and pass it regardless of what the statement says (reply to 2567)

Dmitry: Yep, whoever will break test cases more will succeed (reply to 2571)

Anton: looks like this is officially a CTF-like contest =)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: tf

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Any tips to optimize code ?

Vlad: hi everyone is it possible to convert Address type to Int?

Vladimir: This means the interface in the contract is not the same as required by the task order (reply to 2574)

Oleg: Please, use solution as template (reply to 2574)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Convert it to cell then mod it by prime number (reply to 2576)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Ahh my bad (reply to 2578)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Don’t mod it its just to optimise the int (reply to 2579)

Farhad Seyfullazada: I thought that was on purpose. Because it really made most of us spend more time to dive deep into tact. I built some special assembly functions or modified current ones to improve performance. Idk congrats to everyone but the contest really is great to learn.   After all just want it to be a fair one :)) (reply to 2567)

Евгений: HAHA:( guees I need to sleep... Codeforces says to me "You cannot attempt more than 250 times per day."

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yess but costs gas (reply to 2576)

Vladimir: You're right. That was the plan 😅 (reply to 2582)

Vlad: sorry, but I have no idea how to conver address to int As I understood the only possible way to do it is cells, builders and slices. but Slice.loadInt() func can load 257-bits and Address is 267-bit  I want to store address as several remainders. Any hint how to do "my_address % my_mod"? (reply to 2581)

Sohom: V sus my guy. Given that your CF user is disabled.

Sohom: Facing the same issue rn. (reply to 2403)

Sohom: I'm not sure if I understand the statement of D correctly.

Andrey: So, now the rule is to pass all tests and get les gas, yes? Does not matter that contract logic is wrong?

Aakib: Hi friends, Can anyone help me find the correct function to check the balance of a contract in unit tests. I have wrote this basic tests to test my solution. but it's failing with the error: TypeError: proposalMaster.getBalance is not a function  proposalMaster = blockchain.openContract(await ProposalMaster.fromInit()); masterDeployer = await blockchain.treasury('deployer'); it('should handle excess funds correctly', async () => {         const initialBalance = await proposalMaster.getBalance();                  // Send excess funds         await proposalMaster.send(             masterDeployer.getSender(),             { value: toNano('0.2') },             null         );          // Check that excess was returned         const finalBalance = await proposalMaster.getBalance();         expect(finalBalance - initialBalance).toEqual(toNano('0.1'));     });

Farhad Seyfullazada: I’m not sure if that’s the case. Passing all tests are 1 but not sure if decreasing the gas makes a substantial difference (reply to 2594)

Phin: u need to create balance getter function in contract (reply to 2595)

Andrey: I rewrited C task. It works on tests, but the logic is absolutely wrong in real world app. And i get more points than the contract with right logic. (reply to 2596)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): Wtf (reply to 2598)

Phin: thats fine (reply to 2598)

Dmitry: Yeah, that’s how this contest is going now (reply to 2598)

Dmitry: Only gas is matter

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yes (reply to 2598)

Dmitry: Nobody will review your solution

Dmitry: Just climb the ladder

Hung: So sad but true 😂️️️️

Aakib: I wanted to make a transfer of a specific amount, let’s say ‘x’, to User B. However, I want the total amount of ‘x’ to include the gas fees as well. This means that after deducting the gas fees, i,e, y is the gas spent for this transaction. then, only (x-y) will be sent to User B.  Would the mode SendPayFwdFeesSeparately or SendOnlyEstimateFee  be suitable for this scenario, where it allows the transfer to cover the gas fees separately?

Zyad M. Ayad: i still pass more tests when i implement wrong logic, can't you guys just rewrite problems statements ??

E2BIG: … to match the wrong logic? (reply to 2610)

Iury: I think the endless number of attempts was a mistake, it seems to me that the top is just a fit for the tests.

Seif: guys could you please tell me how to deploy a proposal from the master proposal i don't find a function or a way to do so?

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): Call init of proposal contract from proposal master contract (reply to 2613)

Zyad M. Ayad: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-send/#deploy (reply to 2613)

Aeren: it is <= 30, my submission which cannot handle more than 30 addresses passes all the test on C (reply to 2503)

Vlad: your score on C? (reply to 2617)

Aeren: 262 (reply to 2618)

Vlad: Can anyone explain?   initOf function is gas-expensive // docs says so https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/expressions/#initof But here (https://tact-by-example.org/06-multiple-contract-instances) they use initOf in getter and it costs no gas (am I wrong somewhere?)

Я̨kov: Any code execution in getter functions consumes gas as usual, but they: • do not pay compute fees for that gas • cannot alter the contract's state — only reads are allowed • cannot send messages onchain (reply to 2621)

Iury: You need take it from blockchain, directly by address or  take all state: ‘’’  const proposalMasterState = await blockchain.getContract(proposalMaster.address);     console.log('proposalMasterState balance:', proposalMasterState.balance); ‘’’ (reply to 2595)

Aeren: > In fact, it is impossible to check this point directly by tests just making 4b votes, so it’s not a mistake of the team.  Yeah I don't think it's their mistake. It's more like they don't know how to write a statement in the first place, which is why I said they should've consulted on someone who knows about contest management.  You conveniently ignored the fact that your solution which satisfies all the constraints on the statement can still not pass all test because it didn't implement the hidden blackbox check that isn't even mentioned in the statement (reply to 2518)

Leidy Mildred: Hi  Q such greeting Venezuela tachira ureña for people pleasure I am a woman present

Tory: For D, are we to always increase contract balance by 0.01 ton or what, cus statement says increase to 0.01 ton

ABC: I guess cap the balance at 0.01 ton

Kaz: Hey there, I'm a little late to the party, I'm stuck at 10/14 on A, and I think its the fuel refund part that's eating up my chances. I couldn't find a proper way to estimate the fee of my vote message. Am I allowed to ask that here?

Vlad: I was using self.reply(...) function to reimburse the excess and it worked fine Maybe it is not what you are asking  https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-base/#self-reply (reply to 2635)

Ernesto: cashback(sender()) on the receiving vote (reply to 2635)

Sohom: So you did not solve E, but you claim to have solved E? (reply to 2673)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): Yes I also want to ask this to @ktshacx (reply to 2678)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: why ? 😭 i did solved E (reply to 2679)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): This is not his scores he is just sharing scores of @Galium123 who claims that he solved all question but reality is little different (reply to 2678)

Fedor: Also about problem D. I am stuck at 22/23 and I suspect that I incorrectly refund when create new proposals. Do I understand correctly that: 1. If we top up ProposalMaster and then send message to create new proposal with value == 0 (or anything very small) it should succeed? 2. If we top up proposalMaster and then send message with 10 tons to create new proposal, we should reimburse for 9.9… tons and keep ProposalMaster balance at 0.01?

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: how can i use fift in tact ? (reply to 2701)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: any ref to docs ?

Spite: I don't think there is any documentation that would tell you how to use the fift in tact, but in general there is documentation about the fift itself (reply to 2703)

E2BIG: Where’s the trick? Is there some edge case that is so unobvious?  Is it about gas? Or about impersonation?  Found the solution couple minutes after writing this message 🤯 thanks I guess! (reply to 2693)

Sohom: Judging from previous conversation, it seems like D 20/23 is because something is not clear in the statement?

Sohom: What's the case? (I have read and compared it with B)

Евгений: Got some sleep but after 8 submissions Codeforces still says to me "You cannot attempt more than 250 times per day."  Will I be able to send more frequently tomorrow or I got soft-ban by the system forever?  In contest rules it also says "You are allowed up to 3 submissions per hour per task."  But I was able to send only 8 submissions in total, not 15 (5*3)  Can someone clarify please? @alefman

Max: it is a builtin codeforces ban, i guess. it will wear off tomorrow

Crypto: I don't have enough brain.

Vlad: Question about B/D. As I understood in tact we can get contract's address through "initOf Contract_X(some_init_data)"  And address depends on contract_X's code and some_init_data.  But it means that only one ProposalMaster can be created (cause code is the same and there is no initData)  am I wrong somewhere?   Or we don't implement init() function for ProposalMaster on purpose, so that every user/contract can calculate it's address?

Tory: Are we to always add min(0.01 ton, all funds) to contract on the empty receiver or take out only remaining amount needed to get contract balance to 0.01 ton (reply to 2748)

Seif: it returns the value of the contract or the value sender sent to the contract? (reply to 2807)

Hilda: The contract, didn't find way to directly get the sent value. (reply to 2808)

Seif: so how could I compare between the sent value and the contract value? (reply to 2809)

Alexey: Lol, it works (reply to 2721)

Tory: Ok but they said something on 'The  contract should accept all the funds if the incoming message carries a smaller TON amount'.  Is it that incoming message must have up to 0.01 ton or it must have what is needed to increase balance to 0.01 ton ? (reply to 2792)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): you have to maintain balance 0.01 not above (reply to 2836)

Tory: Ok Does this apply everywhere in the contract or only in the top up? (reply to 2837)

Baran Battal: Do anyone know how to increase points if my code pass tests

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: I got 270 though (reply to 2865)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: Rank 30

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: But i wanna get into top 16 somehow

Ernesto: + with no asm (reply to 2867)

Farhad Seyfullazada: With current ways it wouldn’t be fair. Not fair at all. (reply to 2831)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): why not its fair (reply to 2871)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): ??

Farhad Seyfullazada: Many reasons. First is that we don’t know what was the ranking method.  2nd. Is that there have been so many problems with ranking and testing (reply to 2872)

Farhad Seyfullazada: It would be a regret if we couldn’t see why some solutions got so high ranks

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): yes but i don, think so that they will pubic this (reply to 2875)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): testing is very bad 🤡 (reply to 2874)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yes I think so but it would be such a bad impression towards them. Everyone can make mistakes but you should fix them I guess (reply to 2876)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): hmm right (reply to 2878)

Farhad Seyfullazada: I have implemented arithmetic for almost all conditionals but still very little improvement in the score. Have improved gas efficiency so much but still same. How did some got so high scores? Is it possible to have some insider insights? (reply to 2877)

Farhad Seyfullazada: I have experienced such cases in my work past. So anything may have happened.

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): i have no idea how some got so high points maybe they are using asm functions

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): its just my guess

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: How bro , please enlighten us plzz (reply to 2870)

Farhad Seyfullazada: One thing is for sure: personally I learnt so much from this about tact. And I think it wouldn’t be so if these problems haven’t been. But would I like to code in tact if got a bad impression? Ofc not. And I think most of the builders would feel the same way.   It’s not about the money or interview it’s just you know being fair and getting what you deserved. Isn’t it? Contests are like games for me and if the scoring system doesn’t work well what’s the point

Farhad Seyfullazada: I have used asm. I don’t think asm is the point (reply to 2882)

Farhad Seyfullazada: The Tact compiles eventually to fift and that to opcodes too.

Farhad Seyfullazada: So it’s not the point on my guess

Farhad Seyfullazada: It’s the tricks that some have may figured out or get info about somehow

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): i also got 240 in C but some get like 376 in C

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yes. Everyone above the official shared expected scores have done a great job. (reply to 2890)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Some got high scores without sharding. How do you see it?

Farhad Seyfullazada: While it’s the core point of the question?

Spite: Just brute forcing different variants for possible successful outcome (reply to 2892)

Dmitry: They found some vulnerability in tests (reply to 2891)

Farhad Seyfullazada: For example if someone with solidity background would implement maps would get high scores without sharding but even not now that how to work with TON sharding

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yes and contest isn’t bug bounty (reply to 2895)

Spite: And if you developed the contracts yourself and know how tests are written, you can guess where there might be omissions (reply to 2894)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Pretty much

Иван: You should definitely rename the contest to "tact bughunter"

Farhad Seyfullazada: There have been huge vulnerabilities. And I think they are not sophisticated much to be hard to figure out for the contest test writer/s

Andy: Yeah, it's crazy. Even with breaking the C task's statements as much as the tests allowed me and writing the contract entirely in Fift with only two stack manipulation instructions - I got to 276.92, it could certainly be optimized a bit more, but I'm so lost on how it's possible to get 400+ on this 😄 I guess there's a breakable condition I'm missing... (reply to 2880)

Daniel: How do you use Fift inside tact? Is that assembly functions? (reply to 2903)

Baran Battal: Do you use any strange things , or hack checker ? 😂 , i mean i am trying to optimize my code since 3 day and all i got is 128 (reply to 2867)

Crypto: please help me, question B ,D

Crypto: question B， throw exit 2025，

Crypto: How did you do it

Phin: Check the docs https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/misc/ (reply to 2909)

Crypto: I added throw exit 2025, but it still gets stuck at the last sample (reply to 2910)

Phin: Maybe that's not the case)

Andy: yeah (reply to 2904)

Kinda Bad Music: you know since i spend a lot of time on this i will give you a hint: you should get the master address in another way (reply to 2914)

Ernesto: + (reply to 2917)

dev/null: Absolute struggle on D’s last test what is it? Is it about top-up?

Sohom: Any clue about D 20/23?

Crypto: Interesting (reply to 2917)

Crypto: Is a custom message used (reply to 2917)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: witchcraft bro (reply to 2905)

Potok: They wrote code in funC ?🤔

:: one test at a time  still called progress though

ahajkda: in the online compiler I noticed that calling the deploynew also triggers empty receiver sometimes, has anyone had this issue?

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): But how can we write func and run inside tact ??? (reply to 2925)

Vlad: you mean you wasn't given the main scores for passing all tests? (reply to 2905)

Kaz: Guys I'm not able to check for impersonation in the B problem.  if (sender() != data.master) {             throw(2025);         }  I'm doing this on init of the child proposal class and just don't know what's wrong.

Иван: mostly in fift🌚 (reply to 2925)

Иван: and got 418 points

Daniel: Had most of you people used Ton and/or tact before, or learning for this contest?

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): guys see his C points

Kaz: Saw the language for the first time yesterday (reply to 2936)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: fift how ? (reply to 2934)

Виталий: do i understand right that fift can't fully replace everything and it works like  contract {     receive() {         call_fift_function();     } } ?

Kinda Bad Music: hey bro i feel like i'm stuck at the same place as you were in E. 14/15  was it consuming too much gas or refunding? that last test (reply to 2939)

Grit: Ridiculous if you ask me! What's the point of this 'Tact battle'?  Write everything in Fift and make a fools out of those who came to code in Tact as name suggested. 🤯 (reply to 2934)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: i did E, but i am struggling with code optimization (reply to 2942)

Ernesto: in problem D, if proposalMaster already topped up to 0.01 TON and someone sends a deploy with 1 TON, what's the expected remaining balance of proposalMaster?

Baran Battal: Also what they mean in  All contracts' receivers must return excess funds back to the wallet of the user who initiated the transaction .  This user is sender or person who deploy contract ? (reply to 2949)

Kinda Bad Music: i wish the question logic part was way harder but the descriptions were a bit more than just "Guess yourself". (reply to 2946)

Seif: is it "to" or "by" 0.01

| timon: What 11 test in C task checks? Security or gas usage?

Vlad: maybe storage size (reply to 2955)

ahajkda: nah D is different breed, I feel like you eighter get it first time or struggle for hours... Im still stuck at 21/23 even though im pretty sure all refunds are handled correctly... anyone has ideas what could be wrong?

Sohom: Same, I'm stuck at 19-20/23.

Sohom: And this issue about D has been brought up multiple times here.

Sohom: I have 0 idea about how people solved it.

Baran Battal: How could you run fift on tact compiler (reply to 2934)

Anton: 20-22 are some unhandled refunds, check where you might lose a few coins. what is 23 - I just don't know. whole day wasted. (reply to 2958)

Grit: The point is not about questions. It's about rules. Like you were invited to play chess. But when you arrive you can see that Poker players win ))) (reply to 2953)

Baran Battal: 😂😂😂😂💔 (reply to 2964)

Kinda Bad Music: Yea definitely that's true and I'm sure they are aware of this (reply to 2964)

Anton: last year (or two years ago) there was an explicit rule to use only tact. Those task were easy to do using ASM but it was prohibited... (reply to 2964)

Grit: You code in Tact, but be ready that those who code in Fift will win 🫡 Not very good way to promote a language IMO🙈

Denis: I see being stuck at E 14/15 is kinda typical. Is that "tests 1-14 fine, 15 failing" or "14 tests okay, one bad, and we aren't telling you which one"?

Philip: This one (reply to 2970)

Grit: this is understandable (sort of) because they gave you complete requirements. (reply to 2970)

Yaroslaw: Came in with a knife to a gunfight (reply to 2964)

Grit: and gunner won a prize as the best knife thrower😂 (reply to 2973)

Denis: Some parts of these requirements are not obvious IMHO. For example, "If a vote is not accepted, an exit code indicating unsuccessful execution must be thrown."   ...but E ("scalable") is about interaction between contracts and they don't specify whether there are any requirements on what contract and in what transaction has to throw that.

Grit: yes, this needs some guesswork and try and error

Zyad M. Ayad: Idk this might work cause i think they cant test it, but this is not the correct way to get the address of the master because anyone can change master feild with their address (reply to 2933)

Kaz: Hm Good point...

ahajkda: but whats the correct way then... the only thing I found was the ownable trait but then you kindoff cannot put your own error code

Kaz: Well I'll try till the competition ends, I can't wait to see solutions to these problems :D

Kaz: I love the syntax of tact! I just haven't understood the concepts in Blockchain yet.

Zyad M. Ayad: You can calculate the address of master and match it with sender (reply to 2979)

Kaz: uh wait im confused, was there something wrong in "how" i calculated the master address?

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): How they submit fift code ???

Zyad M. Ayad: I think i cant tell how to fully solve the problem until  contest end, but you can search, i recommend tact-by-example website  And you can use ton online ide if you have problem on local machine

Kaz: Yeah I'll keep trying!

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: you can use fift in asm func (reply to 2984)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: but its very hard to understand

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): Okkay

ahajkda: I have a questions about D though. Say I init the proposal struct with some excess amount of ton and it gets refunded to the master. As I understand, the funds go to the empty receiver and if the balance is > 0.01 get refunded back to the sender. So its like money from master get refunded back to the master and then refunded back to the proposal?

ahajkda: when it should be sent back to the user

Denis: I wonder whether I'd need to refund a user trying to cast their vote a second time...

Passion: why this

Zewa 🧻: > If a vote is not accepted, an exit code indicating unsuccessful execution must be thrown.  it is about an initial "user" to contract interaction or on any of the chain step?

TZ: In document it says:  The RAWRESERVE instruction is roughly equivalent to creating an outbound message ... to ONESELF. This ensures that ...  more money than the remainder.  So I think this means the money will not give back to sender(?) (reply to 3066)

Saksham: can someone tell me how to increase the scores on C stuck with the 260 score

Phin: use asm (reply to 3086)

ahajkda: similar position here, stuck on 280, but I dont think anything can be optimized that much anymore, it barely uses 400 gas

ahajkda: the only option is that their grader doesnt know how to estimate asm gas

Mohammad: Can anyone give me a good source to learn how to write asm in tact and also how to learn about asm/fift itself. Is there a good tutorial out there? Something I can follow to learn 😢

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: i tried ASM but noting changes tbh

Виталий: asm didn't really give me some improvements (reply to 3092)

Виталий: finding ways to abuse tests seems more important

Yaroslaw: yes sure, asm (reply to 3091)

Zewa 🧻: are there any caveats about C? it is nonsense, my completely invalid code produces 10/11, but the right one gives me 9/11

ahajkda: 9 checks for duplicates

Yaroslaw: i think 11 is about storage (reply to 3109)

| timon: What the fuck with task C!? Logically incorrect solution passed but logically correct not.

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: wym ? (reply to 3240)

Lg: In task E they said "You must handle cases when voting transactions fail midair due to insufficient funds. The voter should be able to vote again by increasing the amount of Toncoins spent. Do not assume gas price is constant."  What does that even mean? Isn't it like a scenario when the voter sends a transaction without enough funds, and that will be rejected, and the voter can send another one with more funds? I've try to refund to the voter, but still stuck at 14/15. Could anyone please help me explain what are they requiring me to do?

Yaroslaw: that's absolutely insane (reply to 3223)

Yaroslaw: 83 (reply to 3251)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: ahh, grind a bit more and come under 64

🥕 Арсений: At least now() function returns different numbers in different submissions so yes (reply to 3218)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: is this sarcasm ? (reply to 3254)

Yaroslaw: 30 points and i am in top 64, i think it is possible if i understand fift and ignore C statements (reply to 3253)

Yaroslaw: one question: does your implementation of C formally fulfill all the conditions? (reply to 3257)

Kostia: C looks like it could be fun but I gave up on D, I can't understand what they want from me 😔

Sohom: Stuck on D 20/23 still :(

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): what about 156$ (reply to 3250)

Андрей: It’s about calculating via ton config parameters, not like any constant. Your solution must compute cases when gas cost is like 1$ 😁 (reply to 3244)

Kinda Bad Music: you mapped the address ? (reply to 3271)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: yup that seems to work (reply to 3272)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: i am also mapping the address

Kinda Bad Music: for E too?

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: yess

Denis: Honestly, that's not the worst solution that should never work but actually does... (reply to 3273)

Андрей: You can solve with another contracts, for  improve skills in ton (reply to 3278)

Yaroslaw: mapping whole address doesnt work, isn't it? (reply to 3274)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: it works actually (reply to 3280)

Denis: Why am I thinking how to bypass the tact-generated message dispatcher... there should be a way that's not an abomination, but I haven't seen it yet. Well, there's receive(msg: Slice), except that it breaks the testing harness we've been provided...

Иван: im actually close to break C also (reply to 3317)

| timon: If a vote is not accepted, an exit code indicating unsuccessful execution must be thrown. Throw exit on unaccepted vote => bounced message with remaning toncoins goes to voter address. It is impossible with multiple contracts because bounced message will go to proposal or another contract. You can simulate this with cashback but test will not pass. (reply to 3302)

Denis: It is possible for multiple contracts, I've had a solution that worked that way. (reply to 3321)

Baran Battal: It pass for me (reply to 3271)

Baran Battal: But it didn't pass in e

Philip: That number is not sequential. When it says "10/11", it means 1 test out of 11 failed.  Even in source code of the tests the one that is most likely to fail is not the last one in the file.  TLDR: we don't know, nobody does. (reply to 3298)

Виталий: Is the score formula linear? (reply to 3325)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): Let's ask the admin @xpyctum whether the solutions of the top 5 will be made public after the contest, as we are curious about the types of gas optimizations they implemented (reply to 3332)

Yaroslaw: oh yes my favourite type of gas optimisation: testhack (reply to 3337)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): 😇 yeah (reply to 3338)

Yaroslaw: the only thing I don't understand yet is why the hack is possible specifically in the third tas

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): they are just fooling the test cases but idk how

N: Wait so like I didn't know this and submitted like 20 solutions in an hour because I couldn't test locally am I disqualified. I haven't actually solved any problems yet because I'm new to tact but still (reply to 3268)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): chill bro (reply to 3343)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): you will not get disqualify

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): This guy, who is in the top position of this contest with a score of 1064 in C, has never participated in a single contest before this. Also, his account was registered 7 years ago, and after all this time, he suddenly decided to participate in a contest. It's weird

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: i think you may see the solutions after the contest ends (reply to 3378)

VH: you'll need reversing skill to read the top solutions

Nemo: this is for D: "The ProposalMaster contract should have a top-up empty message receiver that increases the contract balance to 0.01 TON each time it is invoked. The contract should accept all the funds if the incoming message carries a smaller TON amount." does it mean that balance should not be bigger then 0.01?

Kinda Bad Music: for me it does (reply to 3406)

Kinda Bad Music: it wont pass

VH: but maybe 7

Crypto: Does it mean directly writing the answers corresponding to the test cases (reply to 3392)

Kinda Bad Music: .1 to .17 might make a difference lol

Farhad Seyfullazada: The interesting part is that in a real case that contract answers the requirements (statements) none of these super solutions make a difference.

Yaroslaw: omg this contest is so funny

Yaroslaw: Tact Reverse Battle

VH: nowaday with the rise of AI this kind of challenge is better than normal algorithmic implementation contests

Yaroslaw: well yes, ai won’t hack the compiler (reply to 3419)

VH: actually i dont think top4+ do any compiler hack

VH: the compiler generated ts which possible lead to rce but I didnt go deep into that, but in that case the number of hacked score wont appear in only one problem like currently

Евгений: lol that's smart (reply to 3422)

Yaroslaw: yeesss, if compiler hack is possible why is it only in one problem (reply to 3422)

VH: the only possible solution for C is manual assembler without fif

VH: i mean for the 1k C

Baran Battal: If you aren't of them you aren't sure 😁 , because the correct solution or what it should be correct solution in tact will never be that storng (reply to 3421)

VH: i'm top 9

Baran Battal: You only use tact without any hack ? (reply to 3429)

VH: there isnt hack, just nonstandard use of the contract writing

VH: tact compiler generate too much dispatchers or even nops that consume gas

Yaroslaw: that’s a funny name for hack (reply to 3431)

VH: setCode is talked in tact document

VH: for contracr upgrability

VH: it's up to your definition, but saying that's compiler hack wont suite mine

Виталий: but if that's the problem why are there so much points only in one task (reply to 3433)

Baran Battal: Anyways congratulations 🎉 (reply to 3437)

VH: i'm not sure how top 3 gain those points

VH: just wait the end of contest we'll see how

VH: task 3 is special because you dont need too many bits persistent

VH: or even map

Виталий: other tasks also don't really need much

Denis: Aren't all 5 tasks like that? (reply to 3442)

Baran Battal: What is your rank (reply to 3445)

Denis: 62, without compiler hacks and without any assembly commands. (reply to 3446)

VH: you can get to 30 without any asm

VH: a clever if can boost you tens in rank

VH: when you read into asm and gas cost of individual opcodes, you'll be able to optimize gas just by replacing number

VH: for example ton("0.01") can be reduced 3 times in gas

Yaroslaw: Absolutely (reply to 3451)

Baran Battal: Is just about code ? (reply to 3450)

VH: yes

VH: no asm writing

VH: but need to understand how the opcode generation works

Baran Battal: What about storage , is it matter ?

VH: or just by looking at the fif file in outputs folder

VH: it do matter at first

VH: later it doesnt, because it have limit on how much we can optimize

ahajkda: can you? Doesnt it get replaced at compile time (reply to 3451)

Denis: When I look at my code in the fif file that takes <25 lines (problem C) with no conditional control flow except throws... and at the remaining 200+ lines of generated code... I have some doubts, let's put it this way. (reply to 3450)

Denis: Could it be that your "30 without any asm" number is now near rank 60 just due to scores inflation? (reply to 3448)

VH: no it's at the knowledge of how gas actually works

VH: gas is billed at the atom of opcodes

VH: not the commands in your tact

MBA: I stuck on 10/11 in C and 14/15 on E Whats the last test for this two tasks?

Helene: I tried to figure out what do tests actually test in D:  5 tests: basic implementation 0 tests: next proposal ID getter 3 tests: maximum number of voters 3 tests: duplicate votes 2 tests: vote refund 0 tests: refunds in any other places 1 test: proposal state getter 2 tests: impersonation 4 tests: voting deadline 1 test: top up  So there is 21/23. Where are the 2 left tests?

Denis: There's no "last test" - you only know one of the tests is failing, not *which* one. (reply to 3468)

MBA: I think its linear if test 5 fail exit there. (reply to 3470)

VH: it isnt linear

Sadra: Finally someone mentioning this 🙏🏻 (reply to 3470)

VH: and you'll sure to AC if you add tests for everything asked in the statement, but only things you can

VH: for example you cant test 4b votes without hacking

Denis: Well, I'm just a participant, but my experience so far matches this model much better than the linear one. (reply to 3473)

VH: for C 14/15 i suppose you're using map?

VH: that will reach the storage limit

Lg: Seriously what am I supposed to do with the new requirement in problem E to get out of the 14/15? I checked if the fund is sufficient for the readForwardFee (can not find any ways on any sources to find the actual fee for a transaction), and refund if it exceed, what else do I need to do? Really excited to move to the optimization phase but can't understand the scenario here to implement it logically correct :(

VH: make sure you refund to original sender, not the master

Denis: Make sure you've considered all scenarios, not just the happy case.

Lg: It's E not D, so I suppose no master one here (reply to 3482)

VH: ah

VH: E and C only differ on refund

VH: you AC C and implement the refund correctly, you'll get E

Lg: So if the fund is sufficient, everything happens normally and I return the remaining amount (just the same for C). Do I need to refund before actually running everything? And if the fund is not sufficient (checked with readForwardFee), should I reject that and refund all immediately, or still let it happen until the end? (reply to 3487)

VH: in ton you wont be able to refund before running, every message is async

VH: you should reject

VH: that will help people save gas

VH: it's my guesswork originally

Lg: Welp i did exactly it, but still 14/15 😞

VH: At first i thought ton has some special way to bump gas spent (that's a whole magic because gas spend is encoded into tx sig, you cant retry a tx without sending new one)

Lg: Did you check the fund with readForwardFee only? Or is there any other source to check?

VH: Forward fee isnt enough

VH: Ton's gas consumption isnt linear (not gas * price)

VH: There is dedicated library function in tact for it

tyulpan: So is there some way to replace the contract initialization contract Proposal { ... } with Fift code? (reply to 3433)

VH: not that i know

VH: cell("base64") (reply to 3501)

VH: if you somehow be able to replace that initization you'll need to have the original contract so tact can generate the ts interfaces so checker can run

VH: even removing receive(Vote) and replace with generic Slide wont work because the ts wont have the message to build anymore

tyulpan: Where do people do these ASM optimizations then? Replacing the receiver logic, even without passing arguments, doesn't give any gain in optimization because Taсt simply inlines this code in the same place. (reply to 3505)

Denis: That's not enough. According to my understanding, it should have some really bad loophole in the tests - something on the scale of "you can just keep one counter and answer everything from it" - but I haven't discovered that. (reply to 3639)

Denis: Wonder whether the leaders have managed to extract the tests for it and tune for the exact values in the tests.

Yaroslaw: i cant understand how setCode can help with optimisation

Jason: I think even if I only use a uint32 variable, based on the code I wrote, it will only reduce the space usage to 1/7. (reply to 3641)

Denis: It can let you rewrite the dispatcher part that's written by the tact compiler and is a bit suboptimal. (reply to 3643)

Tory: Don't get how asm can be used to optimize gas Can anyone help

Jason: I want to know where the test running on,sandbox or testnet?

Spite: There are 5-6 func contracts in chain without storage, only changing code with prepared beforehand c5 cell (reply to 3730)

Denis: So, what were the known test bugs? The one I've noticed was that it was always enough to check the previous voter, no need to remember any voters before that.

Baran Battal: 😂😂 (reply to 3733)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: show code plz (reply to 3734)

Andy: the entire solution could be moved to the getter by saving every vote in a linked list of refs in storage... (reply to 3728)

Katie: anyone share the receive() for D?

Sohom: Someone give me the D solution.

Ernesto: for C and E the voters were only different on consecutive attempts

Zyad M. Ayad: guys

Zyad M. Ayad: we need to store the last voter only

Виталий: it doesn't really give you something if you use raw tact (reply to 3738)

Zyad M. Ayad: worked in every problem for me

Ernesto: so saving the last voter was enough to pass (reply to 3741)

Виталий: let me send the whole code

Sho: actually not only that (reply to 3746)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: i have seen your prev contest docs, your docs literally helped me (reply to 3751)

Sho: you only needed to check if second voter = first voter then throw in any consecutive requests

Hung: Can you share the idea first? (reply to 3751)

Baran Battal: Didn't get it , but this should be mistake in generate tests right ? (reply to 3748)

Sho: if not then throw when nr of votes >=10 (reply to 3756)

Виталий: my favorite part of the solution btw (reply to 3760)

ＫＴＳＨＡＣＸ: why no admin announcement of contest end ?

Spite: But the main points:  1. You can forget about storage  2. Use only changing code 3. If y = 0, n = 1 just throw errors for future messages 4. If we receive yes after y1n1, then do only return and its should getter return  min(divr(balance / 0.1), 10) 5. If we receive no after y1n1 just use getter for returning (4,6)

Sitting and sweating for the sake of improvement is demotivating when you understand that points are not received for cutting corners, but for cheating.  And when your code is completely correct and you just endlessly fight with tests - it's terrible

Huge thanks to everyone who joined — you made this the biggest smart contract challenge in the TON ecosystem so far.  🛠 What’s next:   — We’re starting the anti-plagiarism review phase   — Final leaderboard will be published after the review — Top solutions will be shared with the community — Prize distribution begins this week — SBTs will be minted shortly — A full recap is coming soon  📣 And this isn’t the end — TON challenges are here to stay.   We’ll be running more challenges more often, and all announcements, updates, and discussions will continue right here in this group.  Stay tuned — and massive respect to everyone who took part.   This is only the beginning. 🔥

Иван: BTW if someone wants to see my other solutions - posted them here.

Farhad Seyfullazada: In the dictionary solutions you needed to keep only the previous sender address. So they haven’t shuffled the senders in tests.

Farhad Seyfullazada: In the problem E it should have checked the value reimbursement but it didn’t it correctly: the contract balance was changing when tests was accepted.

Иван: BTW in C you event dont need to check for duplicates - just hardcode "bad" address and the counters when it shouldnt be passed - and it works (reply to 3962)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Some used asm etc but after all I can’t see any point if you don’t implement the contract logic correctly. E.g I would expect a better approach for problem E. Current solutions would not support up to 4B votes. And the approach would end up in heated shards.

Иван: and also checking for expiration can also be hardcoded like follows:  NOW now 3600 24 * + 8 + LEQINT 2 THROWIFNOT

Farhad Seyfullazada: Exactly. The point is I can’t believe this not being on purpose (reply to 3964)

Dmitry: In C you can use any solution, you need to fake only test for score, only deploy and first invocation (reply to 3964)

Dmitry: Just weak tests (reply to 3967)

Farhad Seyfullazada: And if on purpose then why? I hope someone would explain @alefman

Farhad Seyfullazada: I really can’t believe that it was just because that the developer couldn’t make it secure. (reply to 3969)

dima: C solution with 297 score  contract Proposal {      voteCount: Int as uint8;       init() {         self.voteCount = 0;     }       receive() {         throw(0);     }       receive(msg: Vote) {         throwUnless(2, now() < 1745844361);         if (myBalance() >= 207086800) {               throwUnless(1, sender() != address("EQAblzVtOrlm1vqwNs47LGX0QlMu0zAKXeN12sdAdHXAqQGy"));         }          self.voteCount += msg.value ? 1 : 16;     }       get fun proposalState(): ProposalState {         return ProposalState{yesCount: self.voteCount % 16, noCount: self.voteCount >> 4};     } }

Farhad Seyfullazada: After all I guess the scoring algorithm should definitely be shared beforehand

Иван: no, this could be with any unit tests BTW.  If u allow participants to see output of their run, then they can "test" things, by submiting working solution with some 1 nonsense require and see, if it works

Farhad Seyfullazada: So you can know what for you are scored for

Виталий: how did you get the address? (reply to 3972)

Dmitry: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor (reply to 3971)

Виталий: it is scary (reply to 3978)

Dmitry: Not stable solution for ~380

Farhad Seyfullazada: Someone is into philosophy (reply to 3977)

Dmitry: the stable is storagefee > 1 (reply to 3980)

dima: i looked at unit tests they provieded https://github.com/ton-studio/tact-smart-battle/blob/main/problem3/public3.spec.ts it was address of  blockchain.treasury('voter'); (reply to 3976)

Sasha: Is there any explanation somewhere how it works (Fift: A Brief Introduction doesn't really help) Am I right that actuall thing that produce code that we use as init add dup hashB B>X $ ... in the end of PROGRAM{...}END>c and run fift code? If yes, why brackets in this code just do nothing? Or PROGRAM{...}END>c is actually not a block but two (or more) commands PROGRAM{ and END>c? (reply to 3961)

Dmitry: Hm, weird that so many points using SETCODE (reply to 3980)

Dmitry: Hack on deploy. When vote send there is near zero gas (reply to 3985)

Dmitry: the score =  deploy gas + first vote gas + storagefee

Dmitry: if you replace set code with prepared actions to c5 scores  increases

Иван: Yes. It fift u compile the code to cell and "replace" the output in the files.  And here is explanation why //a needed:  if u just write }END>c, tact would think that you had closed the brace of the ASM function and would throw an error.  BUT, if you put //a in front of the line - compiler would think its a comment. BUT in FIFT it is a symbol - "// a" is a comment and "//a" is a symbol - all you need is to define the constant "//a" and drop it (reply to 3984)

Sasha: Thanks Last thing to understand is @atend @ 1 { execute current@ context@ current! (reply to 3989)

Иван: as i understood - injectiing into current context after compiling everything successfully, and then "modiying" the code afterwards.  Tact compiler uses this code 🌚 (reply to 3990)

Иван: here is the FIFT manual if someone needs it And good videos

Я̨kov: Currently, Tact uses a couple of external languages in its compilation pipeline. One of the last steps produces code in the Fift language, which then produces the target .boc for consumption by TVM and the Blockchain.  The line you've quoted is a series of Fift functions/words/instructions, which perform the context break and override some parts of the previously composed TVM code. (reply to 3990)

E2BIG: My solution with parent-child scored 229 (reply to 3806)

Андрей: I got 237 in this way, may be you missed a couple of optimisations (reply to 3994)

Евгений: nice function (reply to 3961)

Spite: Функции, связанные с фифтом или обходами, только так можно называть. Негласное правило (reply to 3996)

Kinda Bad Music: 🛌🛌🛌 what the hell did i just read

Sasha: I understand the idea I don't understand what these ops are doing, because was not able to find them in docs (pdf above) (reply to 3993)

Алексей: I think there are less than dozen of people who understand this fift black magic with @atend @ 1 { execute current@ context@ current!

Я̨kov: Good! The problem here is that if something is outside of fiftbase.pdf, then it's only present in the code and is not documented anywhere.  Here be dragons: Fift.fif and Asm.fif — primary contents of the Fift's stdlib. And the words.cpp file with the builtin words (i.e. functions/instructions). (reply to 3999)

Я̨kov: Hence the plans to move Tact to its own backend and document it as we strive to do with the main Tact docs. (reply to 4001)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Also, some words are only present in c++ sources of fift, which can be even more difficuilt to find (reply to 4001)

Adham: I spent the last 7 days studying the docs but after reading this chat I feel that my time was in vain.

/B4ckSl4sh\: 100% not (reply to 4004)

Phin: Nope. Learning basics is so important (reply to 4004)

Phin: Just keep learning

/B4ckSl4sh\: You 100% won't need that black magic in production code on Tact

Я̨kov: The Fift and reverse-engineering stuff in this chat applies only to this contest.  The Tact stuff you've read in the docs applies to everything out there, including the real-world production projects (reply to 4004)

Adham: Well that's great to know thanks guys

Я̨kov: Same things can be said in respect to all contests, actually. Competing well is one thing, writing good software is another thing.  Usually, the overlap is rather narrow

Sasha: IIUC atend is a variable but what is inside it? Guess current is also a var, but there is even no variable current in Fift or Asm (reply to 4001)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): My C solution score 285 message(1) Vote {     value: Bool; }  struct ProposalState {     yesCount: Int as uint4;     noCount: Int as uint4; }  struct Init {     votingEndingAt: Int as uint31; }  contract Proposal {     votingEndingAt: Int as uint31;     votes: Int as uint8 = 0; // Combined yesCount (high 4 bits) and noCount (low 4 bits)     lastVoter: Address?;      init(data: Init) {         self.votingEndingAt = data.votingEndingAt;     }      receive() {         throw(0);     }      receive(msg: Vote) {         // Only check these minimum requirements         throwIf(15, sender() == self.lastVoter);         throwIf(15, now() >= self.votingEndingAt);                  // Simplified bit manipulation         if(msg.value) {             self.votes += 16; // Add 1 to the high 4 bits (yesCount)         } else {             self.votes += 1;  // Add 1 to the low 4 bits (noCount)         }                  // Update last voter         self.lastVoter = sender();     }      get fun proposalState(): ProposalState {         return ProposalState {             yesCount: (self.votes >> 4),  // Get high 4 bits             noCount: (self.votes & 0xF)   // Get low 4 bits         };     } }

Я̨kov: @atend is a macro for creating or accessing a variable on the Fift's stack (not TVM!). In Fift's terminology, it creates a "box" with some contents, initially none. @ fetches the value from that box on the stack 1 places the 1 on the stack { creates a new word (i.e. function or instruction) context execute runs the last word stored on the stack, IIRC current@ fetches the box from the Fift's context dictionary of functions kept, IIRC ...etc.  Once again, this is all fun, but isn't suitable for production — use Tact and the team will take care of most of such magic behind the scenes. (reply to 4012)

Иван: or dont use the tact, send the messages using beginCell + endCell and save 50% fees on send function overhead🌚 (reply to 4017)

/B4ckSl4sh\: message function has almost no overhead (I think it probably will be even more efficient) (reply to 4018)

SHY(⁠*⁠_⁠*⁠): But he is saying @imartemy (reply to 4019)

Иван: It does. At least, it has A LOT useless parameters on the stack in 90% of cases u don't need them. (reply to 4019)

Anton: My ~250 was almost the same. Except I thought I have to cashback(voter)..... that changes everything( (reply to 4015)

Иван: As an example (maybe i dont know smthing, correct me): it stores body in the reference, which requires creating a new cell, but at most of the times you can store the body it the same cell directly saving 500 gas on cell creation

Sasha: Well, I only use ton langs on contests, so this magic is the only interesting part for me) (reply to 4017)

Алексей: As an opposite example deploy() is extremely efficient in Tact and I doubt everyone writing in FunC would make this extreme optimizations that was done in Tact by default (reply to 4023)

Иван: you mean deploying other smart-contracts? (reply to 4025)

Иван: ins not quite.  At least, because when deploying you're calculating the contract address as a slice, which requires ( .endCell().beginParse()) - overhead again, but in FUNC you can store builder instead (reply to 4026)

Иван: it IS easier, but not cheaper 😅

Александр: i think you are not quite right, tact uses optimized solution for obtaining address based on cell representation and builder hash  https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/bed9369662a419499997c130c9c95031f4cfc068/src/stdlib/stdlib/std/internal/send.tact#L344 (reply to 4027)

E2BIG: Okay guys, here are my by-the-book solutions for A-D with scores 100, 169, 229, 252  https://github.com/ton-studio/tact-smart-battle/pull/3  Will really appreciate comments what could be improved there and alternative solutions - and especially if someone can share solution for E

Kinda Bad Music: very interesting that this makes like 6 point difference. i stored the counts too (reply to 4032)

Kinda Bad Music: mine was the same except this part

Kinda Bad Music: were you stuck on 14/15 on E ? (reply to 4032)

Виталий: much more interesting is that if you do receive() {     throw(0); } instead of just empty receive you get like 15 points total in all tasks (reply to 4033)

E2BIG: In the end I solved it with 252 score, but the solution is so dirty I do not want to mislead people (reply to 4035)

Kinda Bad Music: i fixed it with custom cashback   message value: context.value - ton("0.01")  for the contract to keep going (reply to 4035)

Kinda Bad Music: yea well same with 275 (reply to 4037)

Иван: but still body is stored in ref🌚 (reply to 4030)

Iury: throw(0) A great solution to avoid wasting gas (reply to 4015)

Potok: can you see these solutions?

E2BIG: I tried to solve E by deploying a Voted contract for each of the voters, and rely on bounced messages to revert state of Proposal if run out of gas somewhere. But then turned out bounced message can not contain an address for a cashback, so I had to keep a map of “in progress” messages and so on….   In the end I had to send 3 messages between Proposal and each Voted, which is super wasteful (reply to 4038)

| timon: Almost everyone here wants to see them. (reply to 4042)

Семен: Taking this opportunity, I would like to show an open source pet project with multi-proposal voting. This is the smart contract on Tact for voting with multiple proposals using TON jettons. It could be used for DAO governance  https://github.com/supadupadao/skipper

Passion: Big Kudo to the teams for giving tact learners a boaster for their journey.   Long live TON.

Andrey: Look at the generated fc code, before returning it saves state, which means full cell build (reply to 4048)

Spite: yes (reply to 4069)

Spite: it is all possible values (reply to 4070)

Sasha: So, c5 update code for the next call? (reply to 4067)

Sasha: What is the difference between it and setcode? Why setcode is 500 gas and c5 just 26 (of smth like that) (reply to 4072)

Spite: I update repository with some scripts containing offline part cells/hash/etc generation: https://github.com/aSpite/tact-battle-1/tree/main/offline-part

Spite: c5 contains cell with list of actions. When you call set code, it creates action cell (500+ gas). But you can prepare action list cell beforehand and set it directly to c5 (reply to 4073)

Spite: Check this

Sasha: Ah, so all actions are actually free, you just pay to add them (reply to 4075)

Spite: You pay for actions in action phase, but for their creation - in compute phase (reply to 4077)

Ernesto: I found you can save some gas by throwing a smaller error whenever possible (reply to 4032)

Ernesto: Iirc i used 20

Dmitry: First you need to detect that maximum 10 votes. Then there is not much combination (reply to 4069)

Dmitry: But it is useless. For the score you need only the first vote

Dmitry: There are two tests for 10 votes. One is only 10 yes with get check after each vote. Another one is 4 6 with only final check

Dmitry: It was the main “jackpot” moment when I’ve realized it (: (reply to 4082)

Dmitry: Only one test for score and zero checks

Dmitry: Yes no checks for successful deploy no other checks (reply to 4085)

Sasha: Realized it 2 hours before the deadline) (reply to 4084)

Dmitry: Somebody realized it five days ago(((

Levon: Where in the problem B is written if ProposalMaster can’t deploy Proposal throw an exception?

Zewa 🧻: What was the problem with legit C solving?  When in sharding contract I used require(sender() == self.master) check, I've got -1 test afaik But without this check everything was good

Denis: Was there any problem apart from that being inefficient? (reply to 4092)

Zewa 🧻: I've spent a lot of time to solve the test, that was the problem 🙂 (reply to 4094)

Dmitry: I test locally, finally escape from tact simple as this. No need other hacks

Иван: you'll have problems if u have some getters (reply to 4097)

Иван: bcs the defenition of the functions is on the top of the func file

Dmitry: First if jump is a getter

Dmitry: I test this getter right now , getter return zero one

Linh: Is there a way to upsolve the problems? Codeforces don't seem to allow submission of solutions now.

Sol: im winner

Sol: think you good big battle. Goood luck you man

Nabi("⁧ ;("⁧: I saw the creative solutions from friends using ASM within a TACT contract, and I appreciate them.   However, with all due respect, in my opinion, these solutions lack practical or educational value!   They are only useful for bypassing and hacking the competition rules to score more points.   But in real-world use, there’s no reason to obfuscate the code. Usually, the goal is either to make the contract faster and more gas-efficient—in which case we use low-level languages like FunC, ASM, or Fift, which are designed for that purpose—or the goal is to have simpler and more readable code, for which we use higher-level languages like TACT.   Trying to force something into TACT in a regular, practical project is just making things unnecessarily complicated.  Ultimately, I request the organizers to ban the use of ASM or any kind of hacks in future competitions—assuming the competition is called a TACT programming contest! Otherwise, change the name to something like “Hack Tact” or “Compiler Challenge” so we know what we’re getting into. If it is a TACT contest, we should not be allowed to write code in any other language, so that we can focus on the scenario and algorithm, not on edge-case hacks to fool the compiler.  Also, while some friends shared their hacking solutions which were creative, please also share standard solutions written purely in TACT with helpful comments, so they can be beneficial and educational for newcomers and enthusiasts.  Thank you.

Farhad Seyfullazada: You don’t need it in real case you calculate the total gas needed for all trx which in this case is constant and hardcode it. Then from chain (base chain in this case) config get the gas price and calculate the grams needed. If the msg value is less that this required grams you should revert in the parent contract (reply to 4043)

E2BIG: Yeah, but bounce also happens when user tries to vote second time and we still need to cashback in that case, right? (reply to 4122)

Denis: Probably publishing tests would be easier and even better for community (and less load on testing servers). When I was solving I couldn't find good examples of jest tests for smart contracts except of basic ones. (reply to 4119)

Farhad Seyfullazada: 100% agree. You lose the motivation to work with TACT. (reply to 4110)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yes and in that case you have the user wallet. Because that happens in the voter contract which’s init data is user and proposal addresses (reply to 4123)

Farhad Seyfullazada: So you do like this:   try {…} catch {cashback(self.owner)}

𝐻𝒾𝓉𝒶𝓈𝓅("⁧ ;(": you must pay try body's compute fee at all (reply to 4127)

E2BIG: Catching will prevent sending the bounced message to the main contract though? And main contract needs to adjust yes/no counts (reply to 4126)

Farhad Seyfullazada: It does not mean you should bounce to main contract. Pa you should not update votes in main contract when you get a Vote message but when you get a VoteResponse message frown the Voter contract (reply to 4129)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yes. Or you can simply send the remaining value to the ovner (reply to 4128)

Farhad Seyfullazada: İn real scenario the Voter contract is not deployed from the proposal contract since it doubles the incoming messages but the owner deploys it and sends message to proposal (reply to 4130)

E2BIG: Aha, so i tried both approaches: 1. Increase counts when Vote is accepted by main contract and revert if VoteInternal is bounced → bumped into problems of cashback 2. Deploy Voter when when Vote is accepted by main contract, send VoteResponse from Voter to main contract and update counts only then → less optimal because doubles the amount of messages + bumped into strange problems when VoteResponse gets bounced with a small amount of gas (reply to 4130)

Farhad Seyfullazada: You don’t need to assume in this case just send it

E2BIG: He’s sending a precise amount of ton to the VoterInfo so he should not cashback from it, and makes cashback from the main contract. So I guess if getComputeFee is smart enough to account for both cases (deployment should be more expensive than second attempt to vote, but how getComputeFee knows of state of VoteInfo of particular voter?) 🤔 (reply to 4141)

E2BIG: Let’s discuss real life scenario!  Here’s the point: is you send remaining value to child, it will get bounced to parent in case of error or lack of gas. But then parent needs to cashback it to the voter, but bounced message can not contain the address - which means you need to store all “in progress” voters temporarily in map in parent contract, right? (reply to 4145)

Евгений: then how do you know which counter to decrement? without condition (reply to 4138)

𝐻𝒾𝓉𝒶𝓈𝓅("⁧ ;(": In real life, you will reserve storage and compute fee per vote and should bounce if context value is less than expected (reply to 4146)

Iury: Most likely, you just need to calculate the minimum gas for deployment and reject requests with less gas.  The rest of the gas should be returned from VoteInfo directly, and the voice should be taken into account via a message from VoteInfo. I think this is a stable solution. I honestly don't fully understand whether two transactions can be executed simultaneously on the same contract, so saving the last voting address may be a mistake. (reply to 4146)

Denis: Note that in real life instead of throwing an error and relying on the bounce message you can send an explicit message VoteRejected { voter: Address }.

Denis: What if one sends a Vote with enough gas to execute receive(msg: Vote), but not enough to actually send the deployment message? IIUC, that's an "error in the Action phase" that does not cause reverts/bounces. (reply to 4134)

Andy: yeah I also had that question

Andy: but it doesn't really matter

Andy: if you rely on the config values instead of hardcoding then it would be simply a usual not enough gas case

The only two ways to counter that I know off the top of my head would be either to have a "network stop" for price change that would guarantee that no messages can cross that boundary or to inherit old prices for old messages for... indefinite time?

Andy: oh man 😂 (reply to 4218)

Andrey: Sharing my solutions as well: https://github.com/soon/tact-smart-battle. You can find intented solutions in the early commits, and see step by step how each of them evolved.  I stopped at the point when contracts were written mostly in FunC, with additions of asm, and both C and E split to 2 func stages. I think it would take me at least an additional day to figure out that only one test actually improves the score. I was going in a slightly wrong direction and attempted to fully avoid set_data within recv_internal, thinking that gas is counted for all tests. But I was already at the stage when I was exploring ways to get rid of the only branch I had in the code. As for storage fee trick, and cheap throw from int overflow, I don't think I would've chased them   Fun contest! Huge thanks to the organizers, had to quickly learn lots of things

Philip: Actually zero tests improve the score. Gas scoring is completely separate (reply to 4252)

Sasha: I tried to use solution with different code for different tests So, it was setcode on deploy and setcode after that  And I realised that second setcode just do nothing Then tried to spend more gas after the first vote and result was still the same (reply to 4228)

Andrey: Yes, that makes more sense actually (reply to 4253)

Philip: ...but in the first version we actually tried computing gas from the tests, except it turned out to work in unexpected ways. For example, for tests that iterate over transactions we'd count O(N^2) more gas if a message results in N transactions, but we obviously didn't want to rate solutions with larger transaction chains worse. (reply to 4255)

Aʟᴇx: I think it's time to explain this solution :) (reply to 3916)

Aʟᴇx: How I achieved 2k in C  The first step is to hack compiler and use asm (fift) instead of Tact. This also works for other tasks as well. The next idea is to analyze tests and see: 1) There is no more than 10 votes in each test 2) Only the second vote can be duplicated Therefore, the solution doesn't need a child contract or even a map  Now comes the most interesting part :) Lets dive into scoring logic: 1) All points come from two tests - deploy and exactly one yes vote. Moreover, each of this test gives the same amout of points. Lets name them "deploy" and "vote1". The other tests only verify correctness and don’t affect the score 2) Min gas usage for both "deploy" and "vote1" is 100, checker do smth like gas=max(gas,100). That means there's no benefit to optimizing below 100 gas, and there's a limit on how many points you can earn 3) The scoring formula is score=200+370726/gas where gas is max(gas_deploy,100)+max(gas_vote1,100). This means that min score is 200, max score is 2054.2 - and my solution hits the limit 4) I make this graph so you can convert gas into score and vice versa: https://desmos.com/calculator/r5lwnbaxtc (it also on the screen) So the idea of solution is to use setcode via c5 POP to separate "deploy", "vote1" and other cases. Keep "deploy" and "vote1" under 100, but don't over-optimize one part in favor of the other

Philip: That's a lump gas fee. TVM does that :) (reply to 4258)

Sasha: How did you find 200, 100 and 370726?) (reply to 4258)

Aʟᴇx: Oh, thanks! I even don't know about this (reply to 4259)

Aʟᴇx: Just add NOP (18 gas) several times to the solution, calculate gas difference and use desmos to aproximate these points (they are the red on the graph) What about min 100 gas, I find it when over-optimize deployment and don't see any difference in points (reply to 4260)

Aʟᴇx: Also this is a code for A (124 points), it is quite straightforward and well commented https://gist.github.com/abionics/a6832efe0fb532a403d80853fdb87e85

Mojisola🍅 🍅: I think best is to set minimum ton for the transaction that guranteees transaction can never be out of gas then return excess.  that is why nft contract do this, takes at least some ton then return excess (reply to 4152)

E2BIG: So you basically estimated that 0.015 ton should be enough for EachVoter work (which may change if gas price grows), and in case of bounced IncomingVotingChild (==case of second attempt to vote) you do not cashback at all 🤔 (reply to 4286)

Farhad Seyfullazada: You should not take tons but calculate based on the needed gas. Since gas price can fluctuate (reply to 4287)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: you can store in a temporary map and delete after use. I submitted that code too, but the test rank me lower. I will share shortly. (reply to 4157)

E2BIG: Yeah I did this too in my 250 points solution, but that just feels wrong (reply to 4290)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: one of docs says gas price will always remain low. also, I don't even know how to calculate gas yet. so I pick one that works, and return excess.  but will look into that (reply to 4289)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: it is not wrong. it is a limitation on ton side Bcus U can't get address from a bounce message. So using temp map always work and you delete after use so it doesn't grow (reply to 4291)

E2BIG: There are getForwardFee(…) and other similar functions for different kinds of fees. Haven’t seen any easy explanation of their usage though - will be very grateful if anyone has one ☝️ (reply to 4292)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: that is why I also didn't use it. (reply to 4294)

Farhad Seyfullazada: You calc cell and bits then use funcs (reply to 4292)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: you can drop a code to illustrate

Mojisola🍅 🍅: will definitely  help

𝐻𝒾𝓉𝒶𝓈𝓅("⁧ ;(": https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-gas/ (reply to 4297)

Алексей: It's basically just a little better than writing require(context().value > ton("0.05"))  You instead writing require(context().value > getComputeFee(10000, false))  You can find this usage in tact implemntation of jetton  https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton/blob/34a60ecf0587c9048d01060aa8fc3e2699ad52a9/src/contracts/governance/jetton-wallet.tact#L99 (reply to 4294)

dima: but how do you get the compute gas constant? (reply to 4300)

Denis: You can use not a *bounce* message, but an explicitly sent VoiceRejected { voter: Address} reply. (reply to 4293)

Алексей: Just use arbitrary value based on some measurments of worst case that will be above that (reply to 4301)

Алексей: Like this is pretty arbitrary values that was enough :)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: as in? bounce works right... (reply to 4302)

Denis: If you need a map to workaround the problem that your main contract does not know whom to cashback because the voter address does not fit in the bounced message, you could instead of throwing send the address back explicitly. However, I'm not sure whether that would cost more or less gas in total.

Baran Battal: Have the prizes been distributed? And how to check if my wallet is active

Oleg: Not yet. (reply to 4307)

Adham: When is the final leaderboard going to be published

Aʟᴇx: This is because I over-optimize cashback to return funds only to sender with name "voter". This is because only this sender is checked in codeforce tests. So you can simply replace const voter = await blockchain.treasury('refund_voter'); with const voter = await blockchain.treasury('voter'); (reply to 4266)

ABC: +1 (reply to 4307)

Oleg: The leaderboard is updated in real time, pretty soon the results will stop being moderated and you will be able to see the final leaderboard. (reply to 4309)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: you can only send address back if transaction was successful (reply to 4306)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: if it failed, bounce won't give you the voter address, so you need wa workaround

Mojisola🍅 🍅: for the child contract, dis is just one out of many Conde written to see if one could get a higher score😂😀🥹 (reply to 4288)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: will post another that returned excess via a Confirmation Message

Crypto: I agree with you. This is the first time I have used the tact contract in this competition. I look forward to achieving better results in the next ton competition (reply to 4282)

Denis: If we're talking about out of gas, there will be no bounce anyway. If not, you're the one defining what is a "successful transaction" - you can just handle a duplicate vote with "success, sending rejection message". (reply to 4313)

Denis: By the way, you can send a message and ultimately fail the transaction with commit()

Mojisola🍅 🍅: I didn't talk about out of gas. if any code failed due to check, it returns message back to sender(bounce) (reply to 4318)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: when message is returned, TON only send back little portion of the original message and address is not part  of such

Denis: If you check with throwIf or throwUnless, it does. You could just do if(conditionDoesNotHold()) { sendMyRejectionMessage(); }. Or catch the error and handle manually with try/catch. (reply to 4320)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: okay. (reply to 4322)

Ernesto: About A, i found a couple tricks that help reducing the gas cost while keeping the map. Since you already have a map, you can use msg.value as the map value itself, keep track of the maximum votes and proccess the real amount offchain when the get function is called (reply to 4269)

Ernesto: The other one was that somehow, voters.del(key) used less gas than voters.exists(key). Probably because it does less swaps internally

Ernesto: I think you can improve it further if you dive into the asm implementation but i had a hard time with rewriting the dicts

Игорь: 1) Will you add new test and rerun all solutions? Some people have incorrect solutions that pass current tests. Some people brutforce tests and write optimize solution for the test.  2) Is it ok to use setCode (use another languages) in tact contests? (reply to 4333)

Farhad Seyfullazada: I haven’t used AI but I’m sure it’s not fair to delist AI submissions while those amounts of submissions that don’t match required statements. It is not the right thing to do.    Let me explain:   1. Everyone should obey the rules of the contest. 2. The rules are: a) your contract should answer the statements. b) you should not use AI… 3. You haven’t obeyed the statements then you are okay to go.  4. You haven’t obeyed the rule to not use AI then you are out of leaderboard    You can see how absurd it is 😁 (reply to 4412)

Andrey: They clarified rule a) to pass existing tests. Tests are the same for everyone, so that’s fair.   Regarding AI usage - there are 2 cases: 1. Solution generated by AI. This isn’t something organizers want, because otherwise they’d train a model 2. It’s extremely easy to ask AI to slightly adjust code style, create another account and submit similar but slightly different solution. Repeat this 20 times and with enough luck you’ll get 5x prize even if 3/4 of AI accounts got banned.   There’s also a rule regarding AI usage on codeforces for all contests, where permitted use cases are clarified. (reply to 4429)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Got it. How we know if there is not accounts that has submitted more than one time? (reply to 4430)

.: Not sure what it means to use AI. Since using any autocomplete tool or search engine via chatgpt can be treated as AI. It is unlikely that a fully generated AI code can in top 128. (reply to 4429)

Andrey: We can’t know for sure, unfortunately. But moderation step supposed to mitigate it, at least partially (reply to 4431)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Exactly. But if someone has achieved this it would require some skills (reply to 4432)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Have you checked IP addresses of submissions? (reply to 4433)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Yes I see 😁 (reply to 4439)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Sure but it still would eliminate some part of it (reply to 4440)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Another way is to set some cookies

Farhad Seyfullazada: Since your IP changes just by changing your connection or WiFi

Andrey: Yes, what I meant is with AI it’s much easier to do (reply to 4436)

Farhad Seyfullazada: I’m sure most of them have submitted from the same machine and browser. Yes there may be some of them who cleared all the storage but I don’t believe most of them (reply to 4443)

Andrey: Which you can clear (reply to 4443)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Sure but not everyone would do that (reply to 4447)

Farhad Seyfullazada: What else could be?

Farhad Seyfullazada: You can’t discard the same code since it is possible two contestant to submit the same code. E.g problem 1 is so the same almost in many cases

Andrey: There will always be a way. Because worst case you can find another person and promise him 10% of winnings for a simple task of creating account and submitting some code

Andrey: And for context, post about AI restrictions: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/133941

Vladimir: Does it mean that you can submit only one solution to only one chosen task? Or it means that you can submit one solution to each task (5 solutions in total) (reply to 4412)

Farhad Seyfullazada: I think some kind of DAG may be implemented by code forces to track those suspicious connections. If you track the ones above enough the. You have a high percentage of chance to find those contestants. (reply to 4451)

Andrey: I don’t see how would these be tracked in this case. Crypto challenges aren’t the usual type of challenges hosted on codeforces. So it’s perfectly fine for this challenge to create a fresh account on a premise you never heard of codeforces before. (reply to 4454)

Nabi("⁧ ;("⁧: Regarding C and this code snippet: require(   sender() == self.proposal,   "Invalid proposal ID" ); which is written in receive. Shouldn't it be written in init to prevent unauthorized deploy? Similar to what was asked in problem B.  Of course, in your code B, it was strange that you still do this check in receive, while in my code it took me 2 days to figure out that it should be written and checked in init. (I mean the throw code 2025) (reply to 4032)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: init() doesn't usually contain require, require can come in the messages (reply to 4468)

Denis: There's no real difference between init() and receive() for the initial message - if you read the disassembly, you can see there the equivalent of if(!self.initialized) { init(); } ; receive(msg); (reply to 4468)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: so, it is better to check from the unit stage or yet to messsage?? (reply to 4470)

E2BIG: Does init have sender at all? I’m not that proficient in internals, but semantically it feels awkward (reply to 4470)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: init() is a constructor and run only once right.  has any function available to it

Denis: Have you seen the receive() {} empty receiver and wondered why that exists at all? IIUC, it's just not possible (at least in normal cases) to initialize a contract without sending some message to it, so we need such a handler to deploy a contract without any additional processing in the message handler. Thus, in init() the sender() call would return the sender of that initial message (whether empty or not). (reply to 4474)

Denis: I wonder why Tact compiles init() to a runtime check on every message received and not to a short unconditional snippet with setCode + runCode afterwards. Maybe there's some reason for that... or maybe they just haven't implemented such an optimization yet.

Daniil: init() implements lazy initialization in runtime. if you want deploy-time initialization without runtime checks, use contract parameters (reply to 4477)

Denis: Why do you consider init() to be lazy when it's guaranteed to happen right on deployment (before handling the initial message)? Or is it not guaranteed to happen right away? How can I deploy a contract in pre-init() state? IMU the point of init(...) is not that it's lazy, but that it's trusted - its code is included in the contract hash, so it can, for example, reliably store the sender (deployer) address. If it were a contract parameter, the sender would be able to fake it. (reply to 4478)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: what happens after deploy and called the contract being called again, does the init run again?

Denis: Checks the hidden initialized flag in contract state and skips running if it's initialized. (reply to 4480)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: I See (reply to 4481)

Nabi("⁧ ;("⁧: But for problem C, I am 100% sure that with this code: receive(msg: DeployNewProposal) {   throwUnless(2025, sender() == self.master); the site would not have passed one of the tests. But after taking a hint from a friend and adding this: init(data: ProposalInit) {   throwUnless(2025, sender() == data.master); the problem was solved and the site passed the test. So there is a difference and they are important to prevent impersonation.  Reminder: 9. If someone tries to impersonate the `ProposalMaster` contract, the `Proposal` contract should throw exit code `2025`. (reply to 4470)

Getting tons into it would be fine, but you just won’t have any way to see the SBT other than in Tonviewer 🤔  TON Space tab shows non-custodian wallet which has UI for NFTs right in Telegram, and you also can use it in Toncoin and other 3rd party apps because you can export the passphrase  (They also have different addresses)  @alefman please correct me if I’m wrong (reply to 4504)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: Tact (reply to 4596)

narzullayev.me: SBT 🔥

Denis: How are we supposed to receive SBTs? Sorry, not familiar with the ecosystem.

narzullayev.me: SBTs will appear on your getgems.com getgems.io profile or in Telegram's @wallet when you connect your TON wallet to TonSpace.j (reply to 4602)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Anyone knows how to do it with cold wallet?

Denis: Thanks. Is getgems the official TON NFT/SBT/whatever service? (reply to 4603)

Oleg: Good service

narzullayev.me: not the official  but it's the largest and most popular platform for NFTs and SBTs on TON (reply to 4605)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Shouldn’t you see it on Tonscan too? (reply to 4603)

narzullayev.me: There is no unclaim SBTs (reply to 4608)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Didn’t understand (reply to 4609)

E2BIG: Should, in theory   But interestingly, nether Tonviewer not Tonscan show it for me, although I see it in @Wallet’s TON Space tab properly 🤔 (reply to 4608)

Farhad Seyfullazada: probably because it hasn't sent notification (reply to 4611)

Farhad Seyfullazada: i see it in getgems soulbound section only

Farhad Seyfullazada: because there is no transaction in the wallet

E2BIG: Do you mean (0x05138d91) OwnershipAssigned? Is there some standard for SBTs or it’s a common sense?   My intuition is that SBT should behave like NFT without Transfer option (reply to 4612)

Farhad Seyfullazada: For example when you send Jettons the Jetton wallet sends a notification to its owner Wallet (reply to 4615)

Farhad Seyfullazada: The receiver (reply to 4616)

Farhad Seyfullazada: Otherwise you should have been traversing all blockchains to find if you have a Jetton

Andy: These SBTs are actually cSBT. Basically none of the SBT are actually minted on the blockchain yet, to allow for cheap mass sending of NFT/SBT. This might cause some issues for indexers like explorers.  See more info: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/126/files (reply to 4611)

𝐻𝒾𝓉𝒶𝓈𝓅("⁧ ;(": actually getgems.io (reply to 4603)

narzullayev.me: Yes, of course (reply to 4620)

Kinda Bad Music: so when SBT?

Kinda Bad Music: also do they have ton society points?

Oleg: Do you have something on getgems? (reply to 4622)

Kinda Bad Music: nice i claimed it. do they have ton society value? (reply to 4625)

Kinda Bad Music: nice nice

Tasneem(“”);: Is there an X account for Tact language?) To brag about my SBT xD)

Oleg: https://x.com/tact_language (reply to 4628)

Seif: is there anything else to do?

Tasneem(“”);: Ah! I can’t buy stars(or gifts) with my TON/Telegram wallet?!! Disappointed… ☹️😢

Oleg: ? Use fragment to buy stars (reply to 4631)

Spite: Вроде писалось про эксклюзивное сбт для топ 128, но чёт не могу увидеть разницу между первым и вторым сбт

narzullayev.me: Fragment.com | need KYC   split.tg | without KYC (reply to 4631)

narzullayev.me: SBT у всех одинаковый.   Только количество поинтов в TON Society может отличаться. (reply to 4633)

E2BIG: Для топ-16 виннер сбт, не для 128 (reply to 4633)

Spite: ну я в топ 16, получил вторую таку же сбт, просто там 2000+ поинтов (reply to 4636)

Tasneem(“”);: ah! didn’t know it’s done in a separate solution, thank you! (reply to 4634)

Andy: Hi everyone! I am quite late to the party, but here are some of my early solutions without Fift and test abuse that I submitted to the cookbook. They have a lot of documentation so if anyone had questions about previous solutions they might be answered here. I'll publish my final rank #39 Fift/FunC/test abuse solutions when I find the time, I promise ;) I think a few things in those wild solutions are quite interesting.

Mojisola🍅 🍅: contributing post on this telegram group just attract the wrath of the admins over there, it's insane and unacceptable. https://t.me/tondev_eng

Mojisola🍅 🍅: been kicked out and also restricted. and have just been contributing responsibly.

Vladimir: I'll check it (reply to 4642)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: I mean this group: https://t.me/tondev_eng (reply to 4649)

Vladimir: Next challenge (reply to 4652)

Vladimir: 🎉 Tact Smart Battle — complete! SBTs minted. Prizes sent. Huge thanks to everyone who took part — you made it real.  💬 What’s next? This group is now home for all official online dev events across the TON ecosystem: contests, challenges, and experiments.  🚀 Next challenge: smart contract hacking. Coming soon.  📌 New topics are live: We’re collecting feedback in Tooling, Documentation, Education, and Tact — to improve the developer experience.  Example:  > “There’s no clear tutorial on how to write upgradable contracts — only found scattered mentions.”  > Attach screenshots if helpful > React to good ideas with 👍 🔥 ❤️ — more reactions = higher visibility.  📲 All of this is tracked in the Mini app:  * View and climb the leaderboard (updates with each challenge) * See your SBTs and reputation, and check out others’ profiles in the chat * Feedback with the most reactions gets highlighted for the TON team  🔐 Important: To see your SBT in the Mini app, connect with the wallet you used during the Codeforces challenge submission. SBTs are linked to that address.  🔍 You can also check your SBTs via TON ID:  This is just the beginning. (forwarded from TON Narrative)

Skuli: I am currently planning to make a library of packages for jest tests. There are teps that already describe how a sbt, nft or other contract should look like. I am planning to make a common library so that when you write a contract in any language you could immediately make sure that it corresponds to the correct teps  What do you think about this idea? Who might benefit from it? (reply to 4665)

Vladimir: Import of structures  There is a section in the documentation with structures, but there is no library through which I can simply import them into my contract. (reply to 4655) (forwarded from Vladimir)

Vladimir: It’s a cookbook, not the stdlib reference. The Tact team is waiting for real use-cases for the described data structures before those can be included in stdlib (reply to 4676) (forwarded from Anton)

Vladimir: Should we create a short 3-5 hour course on building a Web3 app from scratch on TON & Telegram?  Topic: Crowdfunding in Telegram – from smart contract to Mini App integration. (reply to 4669) (forwarded from Vladimir)

Vladimir: Should we allocate resources to create a new course on FunC?  If we don’t create a new FunC course, we will focus more on Tact and Tolk after version 1.0 is released. (reply to 4669) (forwarded from Vladimir)

Vladimir: Local network in Blueprint is a must-have for TON Devs!  Imagine you're building a DeFi smart contract in TON and need to test its integration with existing contracts. Right now: you have to deploy to the testnet, wait for blocks, request test tokens, and deal with network instability. With a local network: you can fork the mainnet, run tests instantly, debug with console.log, and automate CI/CD. This drastically improves DevEx!  Examples from Hardhat:  - Running a local network  - Forking Ethereum mainnet  - Debugging with console.log  TON needs this tool too! (reply to 4665) (forwarded from Vladimir)

Алексей: excited 🥚 (reply to 4673)

Skuli: I also want to write libraries for mutation tests to catch dummy tests. (reply to 4675)

Семен: Hello everyone. I am working on service that build web UI for Tact contracts published to the TON Verifier based on its ABI. For now it still on early stage of development. If you want to collaborate, i'll be glad GitHub https://github.com/supadupadao/minter Example of usage (reply to 4665)

Tasneem(“”);: ah! that’s like ScaffoldEth? (reply to 4684)

Семен: i used ui.use.ink as reference, but seems like it's similar too (reply to 4685)

Skuli: My main project is TonAI (with Cursor). I am making a template in which AI could program contracts for TON. I wrote my own version of blueprint for working with AI. Now I am interested in writing better tests. If anyone is interested, you can join the development  https://github.com/ton-ai-core/contract-knowlenge  My custom blueprint https://github.com/ton-ai-core/blueprint2 https://github.com/ton-ai-core/create-ton-ai (reply to 4683)

Denis: Hm, AI-written contracts... eagerly waiting for the next step - hacking AI-written contracts... (reply to 4665)

Skuli: My project is not ready yet. I do not encourage anyone to write contracts yet. I am still working on the security of solutions (reply to 4688)

Baran Battal: Sad , when group turns into topics suddenly, I feel like it turns into a maze 😂  Anyways, i have some questions about upcoming contests:   Will there be other ways to get points like the last competition, I mean will we have to think about "how to hack the checker" instead of thinking about how to improve the solution, how we can prepare strongly for the upcoming contests , and if I want to join the team at tact, what are the areas of positions I should consider?

Baran Battal: Wow it looks like we don't need to think about improve our solutions in upcoming contest 😂 , it is all about hack (reply to 4673)

Dmitry: Great idea (reply to 4684)

Dmitry: Hey guys! We made an educational TON based wargame https://www.hacktheton.com it will be helpful for beginners and everybody who want to learn more about how TVM works and how to develop safe TON smart contracts (reply to 4669)

Vladimir: Yes that's the answer :) (reply to 4691)

Baran Battal: Hello, recently the sanctions by the United States against Syria have been lifted. Will this affect some of the services restricted by TON and TELEGRAM, or will everything remain the same?

Passion: So these Devs no know to return excess ton sent to the contract 😁

Mojisola🍅 🍅: probably by design to receive ton and do nothing. the poster may not be entirely true.  there may be means to get it out that poster didn't state. (reply to 4744)

Passion: This was posted in the official channel for not pixel (reply to 4745)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: they probably missed to ensure any unintended message bounce back (reply to 4744)

Mojisola🍅 🍅: it is possible

Zyad M. Ayad: Designing a contract to receive ton is almost required to keep the contract on-chain  However in this example i think the user sent a message to a receiver (method) which he expected to refund the remaining value (reply to 4745)

Andy: This is actually a lot more interesting than that. The contract properly handles wrong use (the contract even crashed with exit code 9, not very intended but it should still bounce), however the user sent their message as a non-bounceable message, so as a result it didn't bounce and funds remained in the Jetton minter. This happened because of address encoding - they used UQ.... address that makes the message non-bounceable, while the EQ.... address does make bounces.

Farhad Seyfullazada: Just add a case that refunda if it is over a TON (reply to 4749)

— 2025-05-19 —

Andy: Also the contract could immediately refund non-bounceable messages 🤔

Mojisola🍅 🍅: ohoh.  user surely didn't envisage such situation or scenario. bounce and no bounce.   only few may be Devs know bounce and no bounce and they also can make similar mistake 😀😃 (reply to 4750)

Andy: well in this case the user accidentally sent a non-bounceable message so 🤷

Farhad Seyfullazada: Why? (reply to 4755)

— 2025-05-20 —

Crypto: this ?

Phin: This is scam (reply to 4760)

Crypto: 🤨How did he get my address

Phin: Dude probably just checking new transactions in mempool and spaming all addresses (reply to 4762)

Crypto: An interesting fraud

Crypto: 😆
