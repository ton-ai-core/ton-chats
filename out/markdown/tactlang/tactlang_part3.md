Jiego: but if you can leverage without risk (as you only need to wait for your transaction to be on the green), how is it leverage?

Jiego: is more like a friend giving you money

Max: It’s probably irrelevant to Tact itself. Ill need to test maps and see how gas efficient they might be if we have thousands of entries — that was my key concern (reply to 42984)

Jiego: gotcha. What I said was that its probably gas efficient to have each loan work as an array, where each user gets a new contract deployed that tracks their debts (reply to 42986)

Jiego: if you get a gazillion users, gas is gonna blow them up

Denys: Hi everyone, I have this message: message BridgeFundsOut {     token: Address;     recipient: Address;     amount: Int as coins;     transactionId: Int as uint64;     sourceChain: String;     sourceAddress: String; } I need to calculate the hash of all its fields, so I wrote this code: let cell = beginCell()             .storeAddress(msg.token)             .storeAddress(msg.recipient)             .storeCoins(msg.amount)             .storeUint(msg.transactionId, 64)             .storeSlice(msg.sourceChain)             .storeSlice(msg.sourceAddress)             .endCell();         let hash = cell.hash();         return hash; but I get an error with these lines: .storeSlice(msg.sourceChain) .storeSlice(msg.sourceAddress) How do I properly store the string in cell to calculate the hash later?

Alexander: They are not slices they are strings. IIRC storesString is available but you should be careful that your cell now doesn’t contain references (reply to 43019)

Denys: I solved the problem simply by adding .asSlice: .storeSlice(msg.sourceChain.asSlice()) (reply to 43021)

Georgiy: That's right. You should also care about the amount of data you're going to store in the cell. It should not exceed 1023 bits, otherwise, it will fail with the Cell Overflow runtime error.  Misti will be able to detect some cell overflows starting from the next release: https://nowarp.io/tools/misti/docs/next/detectors/CellOverflow. (reply to 43022)

Denys: Thanks for the explanation. Maybe you can help me more with this, I have an event like this being created in my contract: emit(BridgeFundsOutEvent{             token: msg.token,             recipient: msg.recipient,             amount: msg.amount,             transactionId: msg.transactionId,             sourceChain: msg.sourceChain,             sourceAddress: msg.sourceAddress,         }.toCell());  and I'm trying to somehow process this event in blueprint tests to check if all the data is passed correctly: const transferResult = await bridge.send(receiver.getSender(), { value: toNano('0.5') }, fundsOutMessage);  const events = transferResult.transactions[0].events; console.log(events);  but the output I get is this:   console.log     Events:  [       {         type: 'message_sent',         from: EQBVL2212gyufws6tKtY2Fkn9r65Ys2kJqam7nUcgs6tH7uD,         to: EQBbz87xDR_ufbMtFbszj6byAaPWDJxlbhsKvRPSeuSbOQPp,         value: 500000000n,         body: x{3A60B3618016958C0DEEB4C24F74677D5D3AE348E0CBB23951839F493AD522F9E2C62957DD500154BDB6D76832B9FC2CEAD2AD6361649FDAFAE58B36909A9A9BB9D4720B3AB47C00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000174876E8001_}          x{0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008C_}           x{536F6C616E61}           x{307830303030},         bounced: false       }     ] (reply to 43023)

Guy: Is there a way to detect failed Jetton tx from within a smart contract? I am instructing my contract's wallet to transfer Jettons to a user.  the tx from the contract to my wallet succeeds, but the tx from the wallet to the user's wallet fails and bounces back to the wallet. Is there some kind of notification I can receive in my contract to be aware of this and make state changes accordingly? Or, is there a notification for a positive response (e.g. the the transfer succeeded), that I can then make state changes after receiving it?

Guy: send(SendParameters{             to: self.contractUsdtJettonWallet,  // The Jetton wallet to send from             value: ton("0.05"),  // This TON is for paying for gas fees of the transfer             body: JettonTransfer{                 queryId: queryId,                 amount: amount,  // Jetton amount to transfer                 destination: to,  // The recipient of the Jettons (owner of the jetton wallet)                 responseDestination: myAddress(),  // Set the contract as the destination to receive any excess TON                 customPayload: null,  // For simple transfers, this can be null                 forwardTonAmount: ton("0.1"),  // The TON amount forwarded to cover the recipient's processing cost                 forwardPayload: rawSlice("F")  // Simple forward payload for the transfer             }.toCell(),             mode: SendPayGasSeparately         });

⁭: I wonder how fragment selling usernames. For example, I connected my wallet ton to my username, it's stored on their server not in smart contract.

How this things consider to be safe or where it is stored, maybe I understand it wrong.

Deedee: is there any other way bro

Cyril M |: on my case, I create a separate contract for each user

MyName: Using sub-contracts, mb (reply to 43327)

Cyril M |: similar approach to jetton wallet

Cyril M |: i store the user's data on a new separate  contract instead of mapping

Cyril M |: then let off-chain store the # of users

Deedee: If I make a stake contract and I use the amount variable to map to each wallet, I can't create a contract for each user.

Dmitry: Hm, you mean Country contract should have empty receiver? (reply to 43317)

Cyril M |: take note, you can only utilize fully the 30k limit if you dont have any other variables being store on your contract (reply to 43333)

Dmitry: But it should work without it, no?

Cyril M |: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/maps/#limits-and-drawbacks

Cyril M |: i suggest you would create a contract of each user staking wallet (reply to 43333)

Deedee: Do you have the source code of the big projects on Ton, so I can refer to it?

MyName: Which proplem do you want to solve using maps?

Deedee: I have some questions as follows: 1. Who pays the fee for the sub-contract 2. How can the master contract know if a user has created a sub-contract? 3. How can the master contract know the sub-contract address of each user without saving the map (reply to 43362)

MyName: 1. Contract, calling master-contract via transaction 2. There is no way master contract knows about it. 3. You can use initOf method returns unique init data for each sub-contract by init params. And then you can get sub-contract address using contractAddress(init)

MyName: You can just save created ids in master-contract, but i think there is the same as using maps 😁 (reply to 43364)

Nikita Aplin: Is there a human way to get txHash from sendTransfer?  Now the logic is: 1) Received seqno BEFORE 2) Sent the transaction 3) Waited for seqno to change 4) Called the list of last transactions via the toncenter and took the last one  The doc says let transfer = await userWallet.sendTransfer(...) BUT transfer is an empty void  P.S.  import { TonClient, WalletContractV4 } from '@ton/ton';     let wallet = WalletContractV4.create({ workchain, publicKey: keyPair.publicKey });     let userWallet = tonClient.open(wallet);

Sergey: Hi everyone. I am new in TON ecosystem. Right now I starting with Tact language. I have experience in Solidity smart contracts. I understand, that concept of Tact and TON ecosystem is not the similar with EVM, it is clear. Could somebody guide me  (or give an example) how to implement the following scenario in Tact.  Scneario in EVM (solidity) Contract USDTReceiver - contract accept payments in USDT from various users. - contract tracks the total amount of payments from any user. - control allows to withdraw all usdt by the admin (doesn't matter why)  From the tech part, the user must call the method ERC20.approve({USDTReceiver}, {mount}). And then contract USDTReceiver is able to call the method ERC20.sendTransferFrom() to charge/transfer usdt from the user to contract.  How to do the same in Tact? Not sure, Jetton template has similar concept like approve and sendTransferFrom. Apparently another approach is used to accept USDT Jetton (or any other external jetton) inside Tact smart contract methods.  Please help to figure out with TON and Tact code. Thanks in advance

Denys: Hi everyone, is there any way I can get the TON balance from the contract in tact?

Denys: I faced the same problem, Jetton has only tokenTransfer and transferInternal methods, there is no such thing as in ERC-20 (transferFrom and approve methods). The only option I found is that the user himself should transfer his tokens to you. (reply to 43512)

Laisky: AFAIK, There are no standards related to Approve and transferFrom in Jetton. TEP-74 only defines transfer. (reply to 43512)

Georgiy: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-common#mybalance for your contract's balance, otherwise I would send the value as a message. (reply to 43514)

Sergey: hm.. but how people implement a case, when contract accepts usdt from other users? It is widely used scenario. (reply to 43515)

Denys: In the Jetton standard, when a user receives tokens to his wallet, a special TokenNotification message is sent to his address, so it should be processed (reply to 43519)

Laisky: The person sending the jetton will create a jetton wallet for the recipient. (reply to 43519)

Anton: does this page help? https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/jettons (reply to 43519)

Yevhenii: idk why my message here was reported, but i will repeat. Can anyone advice why this jetton transfer may fail?         send(SendParameters{         to: self.state.jettonWallet!!,         value: ton("0.05"),          body: JettonTransfer{         queryId: 0,         amount: tokenAmount,         destination: sender(),         response_destination: sender(),         custom_payload: null,         forward_ton_amount: 1,         forward_payload: emptySlice()         }.toCell()         }); It fails on this line of the jetton-wallet contract.   throw_unless(708, slice_bits(in_msg_body) >= 1); And it doesn't matter if   forward_ton_amount: 1 or 0.

Yevhenii: Should there always be some non-empty forward_payload? (reply to 43524)

Denys: Hi all, please help me with a problem, I have a contract to which the user transfers Jetton, the situation is like this, Jetton is transferred in three stages: 1. the first transaction is the user calls the tokenTransfer method of his Jetton wallet, where he passes the necessary data, such as the address of the recipient, the number of tokens to be transferred, etc. 2. the second transaction is tokenTransfer sends the tokenTransferInternal message to the recipient's wallet. 3. the third transaction is sending a tokenNotification message to the owner's address from the Jetton wallet contract. my contract has a method that processes the tokenNotification message and in case something goes wrong, it should rollback the transaction. But the problem is that it can only roll back the transaction with tokenNotification message, but the token transfer itself (which was in transaction 2) cannot be rolled back, how can I solve this problem?

Denys: I was told that I can send tokens back to the user if something goes wrong, but the problem here is that I have to pay a fee for this transaction, not the user. As a result, the user can just flood my contract with inappropriate transactions, and my contract, trying to send back tokens to him, will spend all its TON's. (reply to 43528)

nisarg: does anybody have a presale(ICO) smart contract please share me github link

Sergey: Looks like it the right approach. I can handle TokenNotification message in my AcceptUSDTContract and do any required logic around who is sent the usdt.  TokenNotification message has amount, from  fields and forward_payload as well. Apparently forward_payload is reserved to pass any arbitrary data to support custom logic (reply to 43520)

Denys: That's right, I also have logic that handles tokenNotification and in case I need to roll back the transaction, I can send the tokens back to the sender. But the problem here, as I said, is that my contract will pay the commission when returning the tokens, not the user. (reply to 43531)

Nazar: Hi guys👩‍💻, we want to make a contract with a deposit method for jetton tokens(as well as TON). As we assume, the deposit method should be sub-called inside the jetton transfer call.   But when we revert the deposit method (after logical checks) it doesn't revert the transfer. It's very different from traditional Smart Contracts from other chains.   How to implement this flow. Can you suggest any project to look after. Can you suggest any workaround for that?

Guy: Hi :), sorry if I keep coming back to this, but it is unclear to me.  In this tutorial, for USDT, we have: struct JettonWalletData {     status: Int as uint4;     balance: Int as coins;     ownerAddress: Address;     jettonMasterAddress: Address; }  // And the function to calculate the wallet address may look like this: fun calculateJettonWalletAddress(     ownerAddress: Address,     jettonMasterAddress: Address,     jettonWalletCode: Cell ): Address {      let initData = JettonWalletData{         status: 0,         balance: 0,         ownerAddress,         jettonMasterAddress,     };      return contractAddress(StateInit{         code: jettonWalletCode,         data: initData.toCell(),     }); }.  My questions are: 1.  All of the JettonWallet implementations I saw take in as constructor input parameters the owner address and the master contract address.  Should the USDT wallet take in as input the JettonWalletData struct? or should it take 4 paramters: status, balance, ownerAddress, jettonMasterAddress? 2. type 'uint4' does not exist in Tact, how should I define the status parameter then? Is there a way to limit integers in tact to the range of [0,15].  3. What is this status parameter? Should I store it as a state variable in the wallet implementation? Any help on this would be much much appreciated 🙏 .  If anyone has an example of a USDT wallet in tact and doesn't mind sharing it - also much appreciated.  Thanks in advance (reply to 43522)

S: This question is not related to the Tact language, but there are few examples of jetton multisenders and misunderstandings arise.  I already have a jetton and jetton wallet contract. I'm trying to implement a multisender contract, nothing complicated just receiving the recipients and jetton amount in msg then transfer in a loop. So my multisender can't store the jettons by itself (obviously), only on the jetton wallet instance that was created for him automatically (as I can understand), obviously I have to run the multisend function with "multisenderJettonWallet.send ... { $$type: 'MultiSend' ...}," but it can't accept this message because the jetton wallet contract itself can't receive this type of message.  So the question arises whether it would be a good practice to implement the multisend logic directly in the main jetton wallet contract and remove the multisender contract altogether or are there any other approaches to implementation?

P: sure. dm me. (reply to 42927)

Creator: Hello everyone Could be anybody face up this problem I can't find any info in the docs Dedust. Is it possible to find out the pool data from another contract? Or maybe exist another DEX which can response similar data for my logic? I'd like to compare prices of pair

— 2024-11-01 —

poppa: If you have the pool identifier yes you can query it from another contract, however because it would be N asynchronous queries to the N pools being queried the pool states you’re comparing cannot be considered equivalent. It is entirely possible for another mutation to occur prior to your contract being able to act upon the information.   For example, if you query NOT-USDT then query TON-USDT, compare the values and determine NOT is a better opportunity (or whatever), there’s no guarantee that the state will be the same as observed for either pool by the time you perform a swap.

Georgiy: I would start from misti.  You could also use its IR API which might be more suitable for your needs, as it includes more features needed for code analysis. Currently, you can use CFG, imports graph, AST store (it's like AST identifiers mapping, similar to HIR's map.rs from rustc), and the callgraph API will be merged today. (reply to 43742)

Georgiy: btw, there is no real IR yet. It will be implemented soon when FunC support is added and will be presented as a kind of lowered Tact/FunC, most likely in SSA form.

Max: Thanks, but I don’t really understand this code   I had two ideas:  1. Simply add require(context().value >= ton(“0.25”)) and in the end of the function do self.forward to send the excess TONs back  2. Change the value of the minting transaction from ton(“0.1”) into context().value / 2 - ton(“0.05”)   But none of them seem elegant. If we only had one jetton minting call, I could use the flag SendRemainingValue, but since I have two similar calls, I’m not sure how to do that properly (reply to 43858)

Laisky: If a transaction includes multiple sends and you wish to have precise control over the value, you might need to follow the implementation I provided. This ensures that you can control each send's value accurately, while also confirming that the ctx.value is enough to cover all sends. Additionally, use nativeReserve to protect the contract's balance, and refund any remaining ctx.value.  For the same reason that you cannot use SendRemainingValue, I think that you also cannot use self.forward. (reply to 43860)

Georgiy: No, it will coexist with Tolk and Func. Tact is more high-level and prevents you from shooting yourself in the foot, while Func/Tolk give you more control and risks. (reply to 43965)

Georgiy: Actually, after refining Tact's backend, its contracts should be as efficient as Func/Tolk.

Laisky: The doc doesn't even mention tact😓 (reply to 43966)

Georgiy: I suppose that's because of TF's internal structure. (reply to 43968)

GamerZero: tact's vscode formatter extension seems completely broken

GamerZero: like, here's an example of Array type implementation in docs: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/data-structures/#array  the formatter would remove mutates keyword from all of the functions thus breaking the code

Anton: thanks, opened an issue here: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-vscode/issues/49 (reply to 43975)

GamerZero: it's also non-deterministic sometimes (multiple attempts at formatting the same document keep producing different results), and seems to die when you put a return statement inside a while loop 😅  i would have reported that myself more thoroughly in issues but in a hurry rn (reply to 43978)

Guy: Hi, following on that.  Using the code in this link's code  I am calculating the contract's USDT address using the USDT master address intestnet and passing in the walletCode (which I take from the master's 'get_jetton_data').  I am assuming it is a hex string (https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQD0GKBM8ZbryVk2aESmzfU6b9b_8era_IkvBSELujFZPsyy?section=method).  Yet, when I send USDT on testnet to my contact - it always sends it to a different address.  What could I be doing wrong? Thank you.  Code snippet: // utils.ts import { Cell, Address } from '@ton/core';   export const USDT_MAINNET_ADDRESS = Address.parse("kQD0GKBM8ZbryVk2aESmzfU6b9b_8era_IkvBSELujFZPsyy"); export const USDT_WALLET_BYTECODE = "b5ee9c7201020f010003d1000114ff00f4a413....";   export function hexToCell(hex: string): Cell {     const bytes = Buffer.from(hex, 'hex');     return Cell.fromBoc(bytes)[0]; // Convert the byte buffer to a Cell } (reply to 44001)

Я̨kov: I've found people reporting similar issues, and the consensus of sorts is that you have to check that the version of the client from @ton/ton is correct and the wallet type is matching too.  • https://github.com/toncenter/ton-wallet/issues/196 • https://github.com/toncenter/ton-wallet/issues/207  Hope that helps :) (reply to 44183)

GamerZero: Yeah but I'm not sending external messages in this code rn (reply to 44185)

GamerZero: Does Wallet itself send them on my behalf?

Я̨kov: Seems like it, but I'd double-check (reply to 44188)

GamerZero: It's also random. I have a cron job running that sends the same exact transaction every time. Most of the time it works but one of the runs had this error out of nowhere

Nerses: can receive method accept two different messages at same time ?

Mirheydar: Here the query id has to be 42 or I need to provide a different id each time?

Babagana: Yes (reply to 44272)

Mirheydar: So, same all time? (reply to 44273)

Я̨kov: Different id each time. The purpose of this id is for the contracts on receiving end to not process the same message twice.  If messages in your contract are processed idempotently (i.e. multiple received messages all yield same results as the first received message), then you won't need this queryId (reply to 44272)

Mirheydar: What is wrong with this syntax? It works with blueprint test, but throws error when deployed  When I use blueprint run I get this error Error: Unsupported stack item type: tuple  when I call through tonviewer I get exit code 7

Ali: Hey everyone! is it possible to use Merkle Tree in Tact? If it yes, is there a any example? unfortunately i couldnt find it also i am not sure is it possible.

Nerses: Why do you need it ? All TON blockchain is tree of Cells and you can prove any subtree in it (reply to 44383)

Ali: i want to create a vesting contract for possible +100k user.

Ali: i mean like in EVM, i cant push that much data to contract in one function for gass problems etc. so thats why we usually using merkle tree. i am just try to understand how can i make in TON for that much user.

Nerses: To be frank I am not aware of vesting contracts.But I am sure architecture of Jetton can somehow help you (reply to 44386)

Alexander: It’s possible, I used merkle tree in a vesting contract. You’ll need to use FunC though for a small part of code to parse merkle proof cells (tact cannot do that currently) (reply to 44383)

Ali: its just a basic claim contract, i am just allowing to claim spasific amount every month. I beleive i can do that somehow but idk how. (reply to 44387)

Ali: gotcha (reply to 44388)

Ali: thanks

Ali: can you share an example for Func?

Nerses: You mean Jetton contract ? (reply to 44392)

Ali: No i mean, example of merkle tree in Func

Nerses: I haven't seen but I will do some research (reply to 44394)

Ali: ohh its fine, you dont need to do

Alexander: (slice, int) begin_parse_exotic(cell c) asm "XCTOS";  (slice) get_entry(cell proof_cell, int merkle_root, int index) {     (slice cs, int exotic?) = proof_cell.begin_parse_exotic();     throw_unless(42, exotic?);     throw_unless(43, cs~load_uint(8) == 3);     throw_unless(44, merkle_root == cs~load_uint(256));      cell dict = cs~load_ref();     (slice entry, int found?) = dict.udict_get?(256, index);     throw_unless(45, found?);      return entry; } (reply to 44392)

Alexander: It’s only to parse a proof cell. All the rest you can do in Tact

Ali: awesome

Ali: maybe I can just create a structure that will fix the proof. I can deploy this func code and with the merkle data I get from each message, I can solve the root and record the amount the user requested on the map and create a successful vesting contract.

Я̨kov: No, this won't result in any error and that is by design (reply to 44420)

Rus: So I need to add fizz.del(7)!! for it to crash? (reply to 44428)

Я̨kov: Nope. If you really want it to crash, do the following:  nativeThrowIf(42069, fizz.del(7) == false); Where 42069 is the exit code that will be thrown when .del() didn't do anything to the map (reply to 44429)

Rus: Alright, thanks (reply to 44430)

Shakil: yes here is is the compiler output let updateBalance = self.balance.get(sender()); > 63 |         let newBalance = updateBalance - amount;                                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   64 |         self.balance.set(sender(), newBalance);

Shakil: Invalid type "Int?" for binary operator "-"

/B4ckSl4sh\: Maybe I am doing something wrong? I can provide any additional info (reply to 44462)

Shakil: i have two question  1) how to use nested mapping in tact as we use in solidity  2)can we call getter funciton in another function

Aish: Hi guys,   How do we check the version of tact?

Shakil: npx tact --version  paste this in terminal (reply to 44473)

Я̨kov: 1. Put one map inside a Struct, then use that Struct for the value type of your map  Something like:  struct Idk { m: map<Int, Int> }  fun showcase() {     let m: map<Int, Idk> = emptyMap();     // here you go } 2. Nope, getter functions are only there to be called off chain. Getter cannot call another getter, but can call, say, a global function that won't modify contract state (reply to 44472)

Shakil: require(sender() == self.owner, "only owner");     return self.balance.get(address);     }       fun transfer(to: Address?, amount: Int?){          let recBalance = self.balance.get(to);         require(amount >= recBalance,"Insufficient funds to transfer");          //update sender mapping update         let newBalance = balances(sender()) - amount;         self.balances.set(sender(), newBalance);          //update reciver mapping update         self.balances.set(to,amount);         send(SendParameters{             to:to,             value:amount,             mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors          });     }  so this is wrong approch that i am calling a getter function to get the value from mapping?? (reply to 44477)

Shakil: and i am not able to subtract the amount from the previous balance

Я̨kov: No, it is perfectly valid. But you seem to call send() — it obviously modifies contract state and therefore not allowed inside of a getter (get fun _() {...}) (reply to 44479)

Shakil: ohk but i think i have not call send() funciton in getter function i have call send() in transfer function which will emit the event after transaction completed

Laisky: Is there a way to convert an int to a HEX format string in tact?

Я̨kov: Yeah, but not directly. If you have an Int, you can call .toString() on it, and then you'll have the String (Slice) with bytes of that Int, which can be represented as hex by your logic.  https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-strings/#inttostring (reply to 44483)

Laisky: Not sure I get it. 🤔 If I have two ints, a & b, how do I do hex(a) + hex(b) in Tact? (reply to 44484)

Aish: Thank you😊 (reply to 44474)

Aish: Hi guys, Does any one know, how do we get verified tag on tonviewer for your jetton?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Is there any guide on how to use Tact not in blueprint?

Я̨kov: Probably by using https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template, which uses Sandbox, but not Blueprint (reply to 44494)

/B4ckSl4sh\: thx (reply to 44496)

Я̨kov: Something like this would work, but at this point it is probably best to move some of this logic off chain:  ```tact fun hex(x: Int): String {     let neg = x < 0;     let nextPos = (neg ? -x : x).toString().asSlice().bits() / 8;     let store: map<Int, Int> = emptyMap();          let quotient = (neg ? -x : x) / 16;     let remainder = (neg ? -x : x) % 16;     while (quotient != 0) {          store.set(nextPos, remainder);          nextPos -= 1;          remainder = quotient % 16;          if (quotient / 16 == 0) {              store.set(nextPos, remainder);          }          quotient /= 16;     }           let num = beginString();     if (neg) { num.append("-") }     num.append("0x");     foreach (_, v in store) {         if (v < 10) {             num.append(v.toString());         } else if (v == 10) {             num.append("A");         } else if (v == 11) {             num.append("B");         } else if (v == 12) {             num.append("C");         } else if (v == 13) {             num.append("D");         } else if (v == 14) {             num.append("E");         } else if (v == 15) {             num.append("F");         } else {             require(v < 16, "Some remainder is greater than 16!");         }     }      return num.toString(); } ```  The function above works by calculating and storing digits of the soon-to-be hex number in a map going right to left by the number, and then composing the actual number by going in reverse, since foreach obtains entries in ascending order of key values. I didn't test it much, but figured the ideas of this function might be helpful to you elsewhere (reply to 44486)

Anton: let neg = x < 0 ? true : false;  looks like   let neg = x < 0; (reply to 44498)

Laisky: Thank you so much! (reply to 44498)

E: What is the error, when try to send TON to smart contract?  [TON_CONNECT_SDK_ERROR] z Context must be an Activity

Я̨kov: Looks like something to deal with Android activity lifecycle, but I might be wrong here, so try looking for their GitHub for similar issues and ask the question there:  https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk (reply to 44503)

E: reinstall tonkeeper is helped, thanks (reply to 44505)

Urban: Perhaps someone can point me in the right direction. I'm transferring Jettons w/ comments and I need to process the comment inside a contract (via jettonNotify message). Think of this like a metadata check: if metadata OK do something, if not send jettons back/do something else. The "metadata" should hold a few pieces of information, so I'm inclined to pass a map into to jetton transfer comment and somehow parse that in the contract. For the jetton transfer Im thinking about using something like this from tonutils: https://github.com/nessshon/tonutils/blob/main/tonutils/utils.py#L145 and deserializing that in the contract. But I'm probably overthinking this. Has someone done something similar or can point me in the right direction?

Laisky: Jetton notifications aren't always guaranteed to be sent. By the time you receive a notification, the jetton transfer has already taken place. You'll have to cover the cost of sending it back, which can lead to additional expenses. (reply to 44511)

Laisky: here is an example of how to generate and verify signature https://github.com/Laisky/tact-utils/blob/main/tests/Sample.spec.ts#L32 (reply to 44528)

bc1p: 🫡 GM everyone, has anyone run into this problem?  I transferred official USDT (fc jetton) to a specified contract (tact) with a forward_payload, but when I tried to parse the forward_payload inside the contract(inside message TokenNotification), I got an error: "code 9 Cell underflow." However, the same process works fine when I use tact jetton for the transfer and parse.

Howard: your Tact code? (reply to 44532)

bc1p: @howard_ton   Here is the tact code      receive (msg: TokenNotification) { // 0x7362d09c         dump("enter TokenNotification ...

And here is the ts code, package the forward data:   usdtWallet_1 = blockchain.openContract(UsdtJettonWallet.createFromConfig(             jettonWallet_params_1,              usdtJettonWalletCode         ));          console.log('111 Deployer`s USDT Jetton Wallet: ' + usdtWallet_1.address);         let curBal = await usdtWallet_1.getWalletData();         console.log('Deployer`s USDT Balance: ', curBal.balance);          //--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         const notifyBody = beginCell()             .storeUint(1, 32)                  //             .storeAddress(treasury.address)         //             .endCell();                  const buyResult = await usdtWallet_1.sendTransfer(             deployer.getSender(),             toNano(0.77),             toNano('0.123'),             nftsale.address,             deployer.address!!,             null,             toNano('0.55'),             notifyBody         );

bc1p: when I try to parse "forwardPayload.loadUint(32);"   Cell Underflow

Shakil: yes

Andrei: Hey! Looking for an advise. I'm developing a smart contract. Basically upon the call to the smart contract, object should be initiated, then upon other calls, it get's modified, and eventually distributes the funds. After that I don't really need the object anymore.  So, my question is, what is the best design approach here? Should I create 1 smart contract, deploy it, and store/clear objects  Or should I rather deploy a new instance of smart contract upon every object creation (not even sure yet if it's possible though)?  Thanks

/B4ckSl4sh\: Both approaches is actually possible. So all depends on your needs (reply to 44559)

dmytro affixpin: Hi everyone! Is Tact ready to be used on mainnet right now? Maybe there's already a live project written in Tact?

dmytro affixpin: The language looks great with excellent documentation, but it seems like Func is deprecated now and Tolk is coming. Will Tact also be compiled into Tolk?

Georgiy: Tact is ready for production and the implementation has been audited for security issues.  AFAIK the most interesting production Tact contracts don't put their implementation in public access, but there are a few. (reply to 44608)

Georgiy: I don't think so. Most likely, it needs its own TVM backend, but that's my personal opinion. (reply to 44609)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes, for example Gas Pump use contracts written in Tact (reply to 44608)

Anton: afaik, PixelSwap is implemented in Tact (reply to 44608)

kira: thank you so much for your answer! i also got another problem when i want to transfer an amount of jetton from contract to my own wallet i config the message message(0xf8a7ea5) JettonTransfer {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     destination: Address;     responseDestination: Address?;     customPayload: Cell? = null;     forwardTonAmount: Int as coins;     forwardPayload: Slice as remaining; } message WithdrawUSDT {     amount: Int as coins; } and  receive(msg: WithdrawUSDT) {         self.requireOwner();                   send(SendParameters{             to: self.myJettonWalletAddress,             value: ton("0.05"),             body: JettonTransfer{                 queryId: now(),                 amount: msg.amount,                 destination: sender(),                 responseDestination: sender(),                 customPayload: null,                 forwardTonAmount: ton("0.05"),                 forwardPayload: rawSlice("F")             }.toCell(),         });         emit(WithdrawUSDTEvent{amount: msg.amount, balance: self.myJettonAmount, sender: sender()}.toCell());     } But when i run the script  export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {   const pawsPurchase = provider.open(     PawsPurchase.fromAddress(Address.parse(CONTRACT_ADDRESS)),   );    // Send USDT to the contract   await pawsPurchase.send(     provider.sender(),     {       value: toNano("0.3"),     },     {       $$type: "WithdrawUSDT",       amount: 5000n     },   ); } i don't receive any jetton from contract, but i still lost 0.3 TON do you see any error in above code?

Navpreet: Hi everyone, I need some help with TonConnect. I’m working on a Telegram mini-app project built with React.js. I've successfully implemented the 'send transaction' method, and transactions are being sent successfully. However, I want to know how to verify if a transaction has actually occurred and if the funds have been received in our wallet, so I can proceed with further processing. Any guidance or resources on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

bc1p: GM everyone 🫡  this function get_nft_address_by_index is must implement in a nft collection  if I defined it to getNftAddressByIndex will cause someting problem?

Laisky: I am facing an issue while trying to compute the SHA-256 value of a string in Tact. When the lengths of v1 and v2 are 63, the on-chain and off-chain calculations yield consistent results.  However, when the length of v is 64, the result from the on-chain calculation does not match the result obtained off-chain using sha256(v1 + v2). What could be causing this discrepancy?

Anton: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math/#sha256 (reply to 44927)

Anton: sha256 at run-time uses the SHA256U TVM instruction, which only works with data with up to 1023 bits, so strings of length 128 bytes basically get truncated

Anton: @laiskycai Will be resolved in Tact 1.6: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/1056

Ash 🤓: Hi guys

Ash 🤓: New to tact

Ash 🤓: If someone is really good at tact dm me guys got a amazing ideas to work on long term as partners

Ash 🤓: Why is it so difficult to write test cases on ton tact

Ash 🤓: Guys just some body correct me here so we code contracts in tact and what's the use of wrapper and the scripts are wrappers contains the code that tact contacts have but just in ts and the scripts are just used for deployment?? And why is ur difficult to write test on this tact and let's say can we deploy contract without caring about the tests and then develop ui and make it's interaction with it ??

Я̨kov: The wrappers are for you to test, deploy or otherwise interact with the code Tact produced for execution on TON.   Without them, you'd need to write a lot of glue code yourself in order to, say, add tests. (reply to 45311)

Я̨kov: I assume you're taking about the tests that are written in Blueprint-based contract projects, regardless of their language of implementation (FunC, Tact, or something else).  I don't know what exactly you mean by "difficult", but I generally agree. To quickly iterate with Tact you might enjoy this setup instead of writing tests: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/debug/#lab. But once you're confident in your logic, it's better to start thoroughly covering your contracts with tests. (reply to 45311)

Ash 🤓: So if we want to interact with contracts do we need to interfere with wrappers let's ra say u created ui to interact with contracts what you need do u need wrappers to interact with it and all the functions in the contacts need to be in wrapper (reply to 45313)

The gas is same, no code change on the contracts. Does anyone know why?

traceur: Is it common in Ton network, that sometimes messages won’t be delivered to the end, and exit silently without any error?

Laisky: F sends out more value than it receives. Once F's balance is depleted, it can no longer send messages.  Additionally, I guess you configured SendIgnoreErrors in the send function, which is why no errors were shown. (reply to 45350)

kim: Hi guys!When calling Tonconnect/UI, how to configure the payload to set the token to USDT?

traceur: “F sends out more value than it receives. Once F's balance is depleted, it can no longer send messages. ” But why the first transaction fail and the second transaction succeed? In the second transaction F should has less balance. (reply to 45356)

Laisky: The first sending attempt failed, so the balance stayed in F, allowing it to have enough balance to send a message on the second attempt. (reply to 45365)

Laisky: IMHO, it’s best to ensure that the value of out is always less than the value of in. (reply to 45365)

Alex: I have a buch of fields in my contract. I want use them to provide TEP64 onchain metadata for my NFT collection. How I can construct and seriliaze collection_content to met TEP64 requirements? Data seriliazation paragraph is not very clear for me.

Anton: @B4ckSl4sh would you be able to provide some pointers here? (reply to 45506)

Mehran: Hello everyone, is there any sample code or guide to get info from Oracle in TACT?

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton/blob/main/sources/utils/jetton-helpers.ts#L18  Here you can find an example of building onchain meta. (It's for Jetton, but obly difference from NFT is that there is some other fields in dictionary, as described here https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md#nft-metadata-attributes) (reply to 45506)

Семен: you can use func native storeDict for your contract fields. I did something similar. But i am not sure that is good practice for building metadata onchain (reply to 45506)

Alex: yep, that works with small string values. with the bigger ones it doesnt’ meet TEP (reply to 45513)

Alex: Thanks, that is good starting point (reply to 45518)

Alex: export function makeSnakeCell(data: Buffer) {     // Create a cell that package the data     let chunks = bufferToChunks(data, CELL_MAX_SIZE_BYTES);      const b = chunks.reduceRight((curCell, chunk, index) => {         if (index === 0) {             curCell.storeInt(SNAKE_PREFIX, 8);         }         curCell.storeBuffer(chunk);         if (index > 0) {             const cell = curCell.endCell();             return beginCell().storeRef(cell);         } else {             return curCell;         }     }, beginCell());     return b.endCell(); }  is there any way to replicate same logic in tact?

/B4ckSl4sh\: It may be implemented, but it is not very easy. Maybe you consider implementing offchain meta? Or it is possible to send builded metadata fron backend? (reply to 45525)

Alex: Unfortunately I can’t store this metadata off chain. I think I’ll try to make snake cells on frontend and pass packed fields separately to contract

Mehran: Is there any way to get data from another blockchain contract for example from ETH contract from TACT?

مُهندس: How can I create a temporary wallet address, but when the coins arrive, they reach my main account?

Andrei: I guess you need a smart contracts mechanism that simply sends the full balance to another address.  However it sounds like a scam attempt… (reply to 45532)

مُهندس: No it's not a scam I just want when someone sends me coins let's say worth 50 give him a title 50 Only but the coins reach my main account (reply to 45533)

مُهندس: In short, a temporary address that only takes .50 and the balance is transferred to my main account automatically. (reply to 45534)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes, you need to use SendRemainingBalance sendmode (reply to 45532)

Andrei: Ok, you’d need to create a smart contracts mechanism that does what you described (reply to 45536)

A: Anyone tried this repo? https://github.com/Laisky/tact-utils/tree/main  After deploying to testnet,  jettons doesn't transfer from a wallet to another wallet (Always fails) The sender and receiver have enough $TON balance to cover network fees on their wallet

/B4ckSl4sh\: If you need Jettons you can try this repo https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton/tree/main  Feedback will be appreciated (reply to 45541)

A: The implementation is good bro. But make it txable (reply to 45544)

/B4ckSl4sh\: What do you mean by txable? (reply to 45546)

A: You can add a capability to tax users for minting and transferring Jettons. The repo I have mentioned above has this capability (reply to 45547)

Илья: Hi all, can you please tell me what are the most popular vulnerabilities in TON smart contracts and how to protect against them? For example, I know about Reentrancy Attack

Georgiy: These are mentioned in the Tact documentation.  Additionally, you can review what Misti is currently capable of detecting: https://nowarp.io/tools/misti/docs/next/detectors#built-in-detectors. This includes some optimization and code style detectors, though. (reply to 45634)

Илья: Thank you ❤️

Anton: please check out https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/security-best-practices/ (reply to 45634)

Anton: re-entrancy attack is not possible on TON, but there it’s second cousin — message-in-the-middle attack (reply to 45634)

Anton: it can happen for instance when your contract is expecting a reply from some contract and can be vulnerable to an unexpected malicious message that can get in the middle and exploit the vulnerability

undefined: Thank you 😊 (reply to 45627)

Alex: I’m wondering if there are any common patterns for contracts evolution/upgradability? I suppose quite a lot of changes in my contracts after MVP. How to deal with that? I came up with idea of proxy contract which will point to latest deployed main smart contract version. Are there any other options?

Anton: It will be supported in Tact natively, see this issue: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/27. Hopefully in the next release in December. Although, some advanced users described/linked workarounds in the issue (reply to 45643)

Guy: Regarding Replay attacks - so every message pretty much needs to have a uniqueId (like queryId in JettonTransfer)?

Guy: And in the contract I would need to save a map of all processedQueryIds?  Is there any other solution?

Anton: Not necessarily, it depends on your protocol (reply to 45651)

Anton: If you really need it, then a counter would suffice (reply to 45652)

Guy: In functions that change important state / send= Jetton/TON or accepr paymnts

Guy: Thanks for the reply, but then I would need to run a 'getCounter' before every call? Concurrency wise also a single counter can be problematic (reply to 45654)

Anton: It’s case-by-case, hard to say in advance. But you don’t usually need this. It’s just you might need it for some cases (reply to 45657)

Guy: OK thanks :).  I wonder why Ton does not take care of that with a nonce in a every message similar to Ethereum

Anton: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/jettons/ (reply to 45685)

Rus: Can I use getters as internal functions i.e. Can I call a getter within the receive for example?

Rus: let sender = sender(); let senderSlice = sender.asSlice(); dump(senderSlice.bits()); // 267 for me  I want to convert Account ID of Address of the user to Slice as bytes32.  Is it safe to assume that I can take last 256-bits from that slice?   let address: Slice = sender().asSlice(); address.skipBits(address.bits() - 256); // get only account ID  dump(address.bits()); // 256

/B4ckSl4sh\: It's safe to assume it, but why don't you use ParseStdAddress? (reply to 45691)

Илья: . (reply to 45686)

Илья: In this guide for jetton wallet address need code (reply to 45700)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You need to store the JettonWallet address (reply to 45685)

Илья: Thank you. How can I do that after I'm done with my contract? There's a JettonWallet address for it somewhere anyway

Илья: For minting I use TonMinter

/B4ckSl4sh\: Well, you can deliver this address from offchain. Or, in some cases, you can assume that contract, that is sending JettonNotify to you is your jetton wallet (reply to 45703)

Rus: Are there examples of Jetton smart contracts on Tact?

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://tact-by-example.org/00-hello-world (reply to 45712)

Anton: Nope, ton() is a compile-time function (reply to 45717)

Mehran: Hello everyone,  Which one is cheaper (in gas fee):  1) saving a record containing struct in a map   2) Sending a message to another contract to retrieve data  I'm writing a contract in TACT, wondering which is a better approach

/B4ckSl4sh\: Depends on the size of a map (if quite big, second approach is better) (reply to 45724)

— 2024-12-02 —

Mehran: I went trough all doc's but can't find any source to determine the Gas fee of sending message between contracts, is there any source? Is there any way to know it? (reply to 45725)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Best way is to determine this value through sandbox tests. The way to determine fwd_fee exists, but i don't think you need this value in nanotons precision (reply to 45744)

mnemotiv: does sandbox reflect mainnet? (reply to 45745)

mnemotiv: I mean in fees

/B4ckSl4sh\: And testnet also (reply to 45746)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes (reply to 45747)

mnemotiv: nice, same fees across all network modes, so it's very predictable, I needed it for nft minting

mnemotiv: off topic: I'm new to tact, and I'm missing up-to-date NFT subdomains example in tact... I hope someone will commit it, because your git examples are not finished... (reply to 45749)

mnemotiv: regarding ton DNS...

mnemotiv: just because almost nobody is using stdlib/dns (according to GitHub search)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Okay, will add this article (reply to 45751)

Guy: Hey, can I use the built in Resumable trait? or is it prone to such a replay attack? e.g. if a 'stop' my contract then 'resume' it - an attacker can replay the 'stop' command again? (reply to 45658)

Rus: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard  Why isn't it in @stdlib? Are there plans to add standard Jetton trait there? I would trust it more. (reply to 45713)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Because we are already working on official jetton implementation. Draft can be found at github.com/tact-lang/jetton (reply to 45765)

Rus: That's nice. Thank you for sharing. Will it stay as a separate project? (reply to 45769)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Maybe it will be merged in main repo. But now we need to ensure that everything is identical to official implementation (reply to 45771)

kalix: hello. can i use testnet with telegram wallet?

Bad: Yes (reply to 45814)

Anton: ⚡️ Completely overhauled exit codes page in the documentation  Sometimes pages in the Tact documentation are more detailed than you'll find elsewhere. The exit codes page is a case in point.  Not only do you get a comprehensive description of what exit codes are, how they are defined, and which ones are reserved, but you also get a handy table of them with short descriptions and quick navigation to each exit code in the table of contents. Since each of the exit codes has its own headings, linking to a specific exit code is easier than ever!  In addition, all descriptions of compute phase exit codes show examples of how you might encounter them. And sometimes even help you to anticipate and avoid them.  By the way, for exit code 50 (not listed anywhere else), we've also described the current limits on config param 43 related to account state, max number of bits and cells in messages, and much more.  🧑‍🍳 Contributor: Novus Nota 🐙 Implementation: #978 ✈️ Delivered: docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes  🍲 code: dismissed ♨️ @tact_kitchen (forwarded from Tact Kitchen)

Blockchain: Hello. How do we call a function of a contract address in tact? We use interfaces in solidity. How does this happen in tact?

Я̨kov: Off-chain? By calling getter functions On-chain? Only by sending messages, contracts cannot call getters of each other (reply to 45864)

Blockchain: I want to call a deployed contract with the contract address. (reply to 45866)

Rus: Is there something like approve for jettons?  I have a DEX contract.  A user interacts with that contract.   During that interaction I would like to transfer user's jettons (from user's jetton wallet) to the escrow (to the jetton wallet of my DEX contract). Suppose I know jetton master's address.

Rus: I see one possible solution now:  1. user transfers to the DEX's jetton wallet directly interacting with its jetton wallet (TokenTransfer) forwarding some payload and possibly ton amount  2. DEX's jetton wallet accepts TokenInternalTransfer and sends a TokenNotification with a forward payload and/or ton amount to the DEX contract itself  3. DEX contract accepts TokenNotification and processes according to the parsed payload...   Is it correct? (reply to 45938)

Anton: @B4ckSl4sh please take a look when you have time (reply to 45939)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes, that is correct approach. Jettons on TON do not support explicit approval and the only contract that can transfer them is their owner. (reply to 45939)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes. That is the data that will come with JettonNotify (reply to 45936)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Best approach of interacting with Jettons can be seen here https://docs.dedust.io/recipes . User transfer jettons to a Vault and then Jettons are processed without actually sending them (reply to 45938)

Rus: I wonder what happens if my DEX's contract reverts when reciving TokenTransferNotification.   The message bounces back? (reply to 45944)

Rus: In this case this would mean that the Vault reverts. (reply to 45944)

/B4ckSl4sh\: No. JettonNotify in unbounceable and user will lose the tokens. But nevermind, it's only his responsibility to attach enough tons (If the user builds message manually). If you are building a message for him and sending it using TonConnect, you should correctly estimate fee, and return excesses. (reply to 45948)

Rus: got you, thanks (reply to 45950)

Blockchain: send(SendParameters{                 to: _ticketContract,                 value: ton("0.01"),                 mode: SendIgnoreErrors,                   body: BuyticketMes{buyer: sender(), isRef: false}.toCell(),             });  In the code above, I am calling a contract address. I am trying to access the receive function called "BuyticketMes{buyer: sender(), isRef: false}" in the contract. How can I access the returned value? or is this method correct?

/B4ckSl4sh\: receivers do not return a value. A contract may send a message in receiver but it is not obligatory. Ton is not Eth and here contracts work differently (reply to 45958)

Blockchain: How to return value? Is there a method? (reply to 45967)

/B4ckSl4sh\: No. Receivers do not return a value (reply to 45968)

Blockchain: How do I read data from another contract? Is there a way to do this? (reply to 45969)

Bohdan: Messages (reply to 45971)

Blockchain: Yes. But the function I read returns an Int value. How do I get that Int value? (reply to 45972)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You cannot call get functions of other contracts onchain (reply to 45973)

sajad: hi I made a staking contract, can I check balance of address of jetton using internal functions of staking?

/B4ckSl4sh\: If I understand your question right, no, you cannot check jetton/ton balance of other contract onchain (reply to 45975)

Blockchain: I want to call “receive”. Is this possible? (reply to 45974)

Bohdan: here is an example https://tact-by-example.org/03-messages-between-contracts (reply to 45977)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You can send a message, that will be processed by this receiver (reply to 45977)

sajad: yes (reply to 45976)

sajad: how can I check it?😶

sajad: I want to check with get functions

sajad: can I?

Я̨kov: If said contract has such get functions, then you can call them off-chain and get any data they provide (reply to 45982)

sajad: So, impossible, right? (reply to 45984)

sajad: I mean on-chain

Я̨kov: Then — yeah. However, when implementing your contracts you can send replies to any messages received, thus "checking the balance of the contract" by sending the balance as a reply (reply to 45985)

sajad: 👍ok  thanks a lot

......: What's the carrying remaining mode meaning here? I noticed that part of the gas fee in A contract will be charged in A balance?

......: From my initial understanding, the gas fee must be paid by the incoming message value?

A: I can use a DEX like stonfI to get my required token but it seems that Stonfi is not available on testnet. (reply to 46001)

Ali: How can I query the get function of a smart contract that is already deployed and whose source code I have, from another contract?

Anton: There is no way. This is just how TON blockchain works (reply to 46004)

Ali: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/multi-communication/

Ali: i think sending message are exist but get function is not right? (reply to 46005)

Anton: Yep, only through sending and receiving messages you can get any info onchain

Rus: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/jettons/#accepting-jetton-transfer  Why doesn't jetton wallet contain a receive("get_wallet_data"). This way we would be able to check the sender by extracting the code and master from the received wallet data. Of course we must trust the jetton.  I want to accept (in theory) any jetton transfers to the Vault but I must check the sender of the JettonTransferNotification is the Vault's jetton wallet every time. I don't really want to have a whitelist of supported jettons.

/B4ckSl4sh\: Unfortunately that is how jettons work (reply to 46013)

Gosha: Hello! I am working on writing an NFT Collection smart contract with on-chain generation of individual content. I tried to rewrite this TypeScript code for building on-chain content: export function toSha256(s: string): bigint {     return BigInt('0x' + sha256_sync(s).toString('hex')) }  export function toTextCell(s: string): Cell {     return beginCell().storeUint(0, 8).storeStringTail(s).endCell() }  export type collectionContent = {     name: string,     description: string,     image: string }  export function buildCollectionContentCell(content: collectionContent): Cell {     const collectionContentDict = Dictionary.empty(Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256), Dictionary.Values.Cell())         .set(toSha256("name"), toTextCell(content.name))         .set(toSha256("description"), toTextCell(content.description))         .set(toSha256("image"), toTextCell(content.image));          return beginCell()              .storeUint(0,8)             .storeDict(collectionContentDict)             .endCell();  } into something like this on Tact:     fun toTextCell(text: String): Cell {         return beginCell().storeSlice(text.asSlice()).endCell();     }      fun buildCollectionContentCell(content: CollectionContent): Cell {         let collectionContentDict: map<Int, Cell> = emptyMap();         collectionContentDict.set(sha256("name"), self.toTextCell(content.name));         collectionContentDict.set(sha256("description"), self.toTextCell(content.description));         collectionContentDict.set(sha256("image"), self.toTextCell(content.image));          return beginCell()             .storeUint(0, 8)             .storeRef(collectionContentDict.asCell()!!)              .endCell();     } However, it’s not working as expected—the metadata of the NFT items is coming out empty.  Could you please help me with this?

مُهندس: What is the solution (reply to 46020)

مُهندس: ؟

/B4ckSl4sh\: You are not storing prefix in toTestCell and also you store Slice (so just one cell) not string tail. (reply to 46015)

Gosha: How to store string tail in tact? Builder has no such method( (reply to 46023)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You should write that method manually (reply to 46024)

مُهندس: @B4ckSl4sh (reply to 46020)

/B4ckSl4sh\: This screen does not explain anything). Only thing I can say - why do you provide null as a parameter in send method? What exactly do you want to send? Just Toncoins? What is the purpose of this test? (reply to 46032)

مُهندس: This test is for receiving coins (reply to 46033)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Well, ton blockchain itself will take care of it) (reply to 46034)

مُهندس: This is the code

/B4ckSl4sh\: Sorry for my incorrect answer. You can utilize stringBuilder. It has a support of building tail strings (reply to 46024)

Gosha: You mean something like this?     fun toTextCell(text: String): Cell {         let sb: StringBuilder = beginTailString();         sb.append(text);         let textCell: Cell = sb.toCell();         return beginCell().storeUint(0, 8).storeRef(textCell).endCell();     }  (metadata still empty 😭) (reply to 46041)

/B4ckSl4sh\: TailString already prefixed with null byte and do don't need to store that in ref (reply to 46045)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Did you make it? (reply to 46045)

Gosha: I tried this, without storeUint(0,8):     fun toTextCell(text: String): Cell {         let sb: StringBuilder = beginTailString();         sb.append(text);         let textCell: Cell = sb.toCell();         return beginCell().storeRef(textCell).endCell();     } but nothing changed (reply to 46047)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Why don't you do return sb.toCell() ? You get an extra ref now (reply to 46049)

Gosha:     fun toTextCell(text: String): Cell {         let sb: StringBuilder = beginTailString();         sb.append(text);         return sb.toCell();     }  still empty metadata( (reply to 46050)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I doublechecked your meta. And here is the difference from meta that should be valid. (reply to 46124)

/B4ckSl4sh\: That null byte is valid. Here is the only difference in your meta to TypeScript generated (reply to 46127)

/B4ckSl4sh\: That must be not .storeRef (reply to 46053)

/B4ckSl4sh\: That must be storeMaybeRef (or store dict)

Cyril M |: anyone here who have experience creating nft with tact?

Cyril M |: @here

Cyril M |: can we make the content_url of the nftitem as an api with json response?

Olumo: I have experience with that (reply to 46133)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I fixed your metadata. You should initialize your map like this.  let collectionContentDict: map<Int as uint256, Cell> = emptyMap(); (And, as said above, use storeMaybeRef, or StoreDict, or storeBit(true) and then storeRef) (reply to 46054)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Try it out please, should work perfectly) (reply to 46054)

Why does such an error occur?

/B4ckSl4sh\: it is not an error. Map (as any other TON type in storage) is Cell or a part of Cell. And you get base64 representation of Cell (reply to 46194)

Blockchain: fun Prices(){         let a: Int = 0;                  repeat (18) {             if (a >= 1 && a <= 6) {                 self.stagePrice.set(a, 100);             } else if (a >= 7 && a <= 12) {                 self.stagePrice.set(a, 200);             } else if (a >= 13 && a <= 18) {                 self.stagePrice.set(a, 300);             }              a = a + 1;         }     }  i make this.

Mehran: In IJ IDE I have TON plugin installed, created a project for TACT using blueprint, built and deployed the project on test-net and everything works fine, but IJ IDE always show 'Unresolved reference' error for known TACT functions like   .notify or .asComment  (Attached screenshot)  Is there anyway to get ride of this error? (Don't prefer to disable all inspection errors)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): what about neovim, Helix? (reply to 46270)

Mehran: Hmm, prefer to fix IJ as I always worked with Jetbrain products and am more comfortable with that. So is it a TON plugin known issue for IJ? (reply to 46271)

Rinat | ZilPay (Will not Call or DM you): i hate vscode and any simular editor, i use helix for now and i a bit sad because it hasn't grammarly for tact (reply to 46272)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You can buy them on tonconsole (reply to 46292)

Rus: Hi, haven't found a notion of token decimals in jetton master contract.  How to know what is the smallest jetton amount precision?  Is it possible to learn it on-chain (or it needs to be hardcoded e.g. jettonMasterAddress => decimals)? (reply to 45769)

Alex: found diagrams here, if somebody needed   https://github.com/Laisky/tact-utils/tree/main/contracts/jetton#flows (reply to 46291)

/B4ckSl4sh\: In Blockchain no decimals exists actually. It is only for off-chain representation (reply to 46314)

Rus: Oh, okay, I just need to do some calculations with different jettons and must ensure the precision stays the same.  e.g. dst jetton amount = src jetton amount * exchange rate  But jettons may have different precision, right? (reply to 46321)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes (reply to 46322)

Rus: Okay I guess I need to hardcode their precision explicitly on chain

/B4ckSl4sh\: You can set your exchange_rate based on both decimals (reply to 46322)

Rus: Interesting idea (reply to 46325)

Rus: thank you! (reply to 46325)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You can make a receiver for Deploy opcode (or use deploy trait from stdlib). Or you can just attach incorrect opcode - contract will be deployed and you will receive your TONs with bounced message.

Tea the Bottle: receive("Mint") { // Public Minting         let ctx: Context = context();         let amount: Int = context().value; // Amount of TON sent with the transaction         dump(amount);          // Ensure the user sends a valid amount         require(amount >= 200000000, "Minimum 0.2 TON required to mint");         require(self.mintable, "Minting is not enabled");          // Define the Jetton conversion rate (e.g., 1 TON = 10 Jettons)         // let conversion_rate: Int = 10;         let jettons_to_mint: Int = 50000;          // Ensure the minting does not exceed the maximum supply         require(self.total_supply + jettons_to_mint <= self.max_supply, "Max supply exceeded");          // Mint the calculated amount of Jettons for the sender         self.mint(ctx.sender, jettons_to_mint, self.owner);          send(SendParameters{                 to: sender(),                 value: 0,                 mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,                 bounce: false,                 body: TokenNotification{ // 0x7362d09c -- Remind the new Owner                     query_id: 0,                     amount: jettons_to_mint,                     from: myAddress(),                     forward_payload: beginCell().endCell().asSlice()                 }.toCell()             }         );      }

Sol: Hello. I really need an experienced person who can write on time, to consult on the project.

wizardev: @Thea

wizardev: Are you ton dev ?

wizardev: would you plz help me one thing ?

wizardev: I've deployed one jetton contract

wizardev: and have to interact with that contract but confused how to interact with it

wizardev:   // // Log the contract address     // console.log("Reading Contract Info...");     // console.log(`Contract Address : ${contract_address.toString()}`);      // Instantiate the contract and open it with the client     const contract = await JettonLaunch.fromAddress(Address.parse("kQAkEa4fhU2XJe9zmXUI51kp4kKDD8JE0zfG0lfhW-g0zLhs"));     const contract_open = await client.open(contract);      const initMintAmount = toNano("400000000")      const InitMint: InitMint = {         $$type: "InitMint",         amount: initMintAmount,     };      const provider = client.provider(Address.parse('kQAkEa4fhU2XJe9zmXUI51kp4kKDD8JE0zfG0lfhW-g0zLhs'))      const temp = await contract_open.send(deployer_wallet.sender(provider, secretKey), { value: BigInt('10') }, InitMint)      console.log("result : ", temp);

wizardev: This is current codebase

wizardev: JettonLaunch is jettonmaster contract

wizardev: kQAkEa4fhU2XJe9zmXUI51kp4kKDD8JE0zfG0lfhW-g0zLhs

wizardev: is jetton address

wizardev: I've to mint jetton from that contract but how can i access that contract ?

wizardev: plz help me out

wizardev: blueprint is working well

wizardev: Can we do it on here plz (reply to 46514)

wizardev: It might be helpful for other beginners

wizardev: plz leave me msg here

Sol: Consultation 30 min (reply to 46497)

Alex: Hey, could you please share some good example (not from the docs) with simple jetton transwer logic (usdt)?

Anton: would this help? https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/jettons/#usdt-jetton-operations  it’s from the Tact docs but it’s in the recipe format (reply to 46532)

Alex: Hi Anton, thanks for sharing the docs, it is really great, but i still misunderstood some key concept from it so i hope that having a good example with the tests will cover that (reply to 46533)

Alex: Maybe you could anwser this questions? I found a diagram with token transfer flow. Seems that user or contract might have two wallet addresses - wallet and jetton wallet. So how can i get jetton addrees from contract? Is this jetton wallet should be initialized on the deploy? For me these topics is not very clear since i'm coming not from funC and blockchain. Lets say i have a simple contract witch main responsible is to distribute incoming jettons (usdt) to two wallet (let say contract owner and orginizer). How to communicate with such contract from the frontend (user wallet)? (reply to 46533)

Alex: is this necessary to have uint4 in status of JettonWalletData struct for USDT contract? What does it mean?  Seems i have a problem with Tact version, but i have 0.22 blueprint version

Я̨kov: Perhaps your Tact version is quite low, try yarn upgrade -p @tact-lang/compiler (adjust for your package manager) (reply to 46540)

Alex: thanks, at least a can build a contract now (reply to 46548)

Alex: what is jettonWalletCode in init of contract? https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/jettons/#sending-jetton-transfer

Mo30: is there's a way use env or variable when we deploy contract?  i mean build time environment variables like dart  I don't want use init , i want define some const variable but they changed during deployment

Mo30: because these are shared between multi contracts and i don't want to pass these to other ones each time   one workaround i thought is genereting this file on fly (reply to 46552)

Alex: deploy your contract using TypeScript and put any data into init (reply to 46554)

Mo30: i know these are global static variables which i have to change when i want to deploy on mainnet or testnet and local testing (reply to 46556)

Alex: if you are using programmatic deploy then use env vars from them (reply to 46557)

🙏🙏🙏: Good day everybody!  Can somebody help me with handling asm functions in Tact? I am not sure if I'm doing sha512 right inside my contract:  asm fun sha512( s: Builder ): Slice {     ONE HASHEXT_SHA512 }  asm fun sha512Two( s1: Builder, s2: Builder ): Slice {     TWO HASHEXT_SHA512 }  Should it return Slice? Or Cell? Or smth else? I know that it returns two 256 bit integers from TVM but I don't see any explanation on how to handle such data with Tact (I know that we can do it in func).  Thanks!

Anton: @novusnota42 please take a look (reply to 46563)

Илья: How can i fix this error: "If the balance is not enough to pay for gas_usage gas then the compute phase fails with skip reason cskip_no_gas."? When I try to transfer jetton to contract

Я̨kov: If you just want an on-chain hash that'll produce correct results (same as H-strings in FunC) for Builders/Slices (viewed as Strings) with any number of bytes allowed within account limits, then refer to this comment (soon to be in the docs).  Now, in general, whenever you expect multiple return values (tensor or tuple return types OR multiple stack values), then you have to provide a Struct to capture those. For example, it can look something like this:  struct Sha512 { h1: Int; h2: Int } asm fun sha512(s: Slice): Sha512 { ONE HASHEXT_SHA512 UNPAIR } asm fun twoSha512(s1: Slice, s2: Slice): Sha512 { TWO HASHEXT_SHA512 UNPAIR } Btw, there is HASHEXTA_SHA512, which would also append the result to the provided Builder and return the new Builder. That is, no extra Structs for mapping needed :) (reply to 46563)

🙏🙏🙏: Thank you so much! I was actually doing the Struct approach but I didn’t know that asm functions could handle destructuring directly  Thank you so much again! (reply to 46570)

Oleksandr: Hey.  Created a simple counter contract on TACT  I want to know how I can interact with contract on front-end.  Found that I needed use contract wrapper from contract folder and import it to my front-end - which is weird.  On EVM I can use wagmi and ABI contract and easily  interact, but how I TON?

Blockchain: When I deploy it with sandbox, the data appears without any problems. But when I deploy it on the testnet, it appears as base64. Why is this so? Where am I doing wrong? Can you help with this? urgent!

Alex: ⚡️Just a quick reminder that we're collecting your feedback on the developer experience.  Today is the last chance to share your thoughts with the Tact team, and your input will be taken into account!🧐 (reply to 46113)

Rus: New jetton standard is highly needed :) (reply to 46113)

Anton: what should be in that standard? (reply to 46761)

Anton: or do you mean a jetton implementation in Tact?

Rus: I mean the whole standard.   I find approval functionality like on Solana SPL tokens or Ethereum ERC20 tokens safer than Jetton Notifications solution, where the token transfer transaction is not reverted (bounced) even if the notification is reverted (bounced).  Also the jetton standard does not has decimals field to rely on the token precision on chain.  Are there any open discussions on that topic?

sajad: hi may you share your code( transfer jetton ) (reply to 46764)

/B4ckSl4sh\: There is no need of that. Fractional number of tokens is just convenient for humans, but there is no need of such information onchain (reply to 46764)

Anton: Discussion like that can be conducted here: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs (reply to 46764)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Such a standard is possible in theory, but it would make transactions more expensive, so now it's done this way (reply to 46764)

sajad: tx is confirm

/B4ckSl4sh\: I believe that in your case you need to send TokenTransfer (not TokenTransferInternal) to your JettonWallet (reply to 46772)

sajad: just this? (reply to 46774)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Wait, in receiver, what you are trying to process? If you want to process incoming Jettons you need to create receive(JettonNotify) (reply to 46775)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I believe this article will help you to understand https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons

sajad: thanks a lot, let me check it 🌱👍 (reply to 46776)

sajad: hello again   receive(msg: JettonTransferNotification) {   if(sender() == self.owner){    self.balanceJettonContract += msg.amount;   }   if(sender() == self.token){    self.balanceJettonContract += msg.amount + 1;   }    emit(JettonInfo{sender: sender(), msgSender: msg.sender, amount: msg.amount}.toCell());           self.forward(msg.sender, null, false, null);   self.reply(JettonInfo{sender: sender(), msgSender: msg.sender, amount: msg.amount}.toCell());     }   I use this code, how can find Jetton Address is right?

sajad: I want to grow up self.balanceJettonContract

/B4ckSl4sh\: You should validate that JettonNotify comes from your JettonWallet. In most cases you need to ship information about this address from offchain. In rare cases, TEP-89 could help, but not all jettons implement TEP-89 (reply to 46781)

Victor: Hi guys, how to calculate op_codes in tact?  According to docs we should use CRC32 from TL-B Schema https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/crc32  but according to tact's docs we should use type signatures instead of tlb https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L935 i.e. I've got TLB and Signature from .md project file after tact building  TLB: check_in#722bfa86 chatId:int257 = CheckIn Signature: CheckIn{chatId:int257}  I've tried to get crc32 from signature and got  crc32("CheckIn{chatId:int257}") = 0x7ec9b591 I've tried to use & 0x7FFFFFFF according to the 1st url and got 0xfec9b591  So, anyone knows how to get 722bfa86 opcode for CheckIn{chatId:int257} in tact?

Anton: you most likely do not need to calculate the message opcodes, since you can specify those like so:   message(0x722bfa86) Checkin {     chatId: Int; } (reply to 46801)

Victor: but I want to calculate  :D (reply to 46802)

Anton: here is how it’s calculated by the Tact compiler for a message: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/607c2872ea5a13c343ddb3e33bdaf8135438e0e0/src/types/resolveSignatures.ts#L185-L200 (reply to 46803)

sajad: thank you so much 🌱 I must be check it (reply to 46835)

Alex: Trading, do you mean “swap” or “sell”? From what you texted in following text, I conclude you mean swap.  The best way to follow the documentation of DEX(dedust and ston.fi) where you plan to manage swap.  Additional examples: - https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/cookbook#third-party-decentralized-exchanges-dex - https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/dexes/dedust/ - https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/dexes/stonfi/ (reply to 46836)

Андрей: how do I execute something in the smart contract when certain time passes? e.g. a Campaign should be closed on the deadline, and the funds should be distributed. deadline is a Contract’s state that has been initialized when the contract was deployed

Андрей: like I understand a message needs to be sent to the contract, but the whole idea of the app is that campaign gets created with a specified deadline when it should be closed. then on the deadline, the funds are transferred to the participants — who is sending the message to close the campaign?

Erfan: you should have a admin wallet authenticate it with it's address and trigger the deadline after sending the message (reply to 46855)

Андрей: but how to automate so that the message is sent right on the deadline? there won’t be anyone who is sending the message manually when the deadline date/time comes, right?   I’m coming from the web development and my head is wrapped around the concept of cron jobs that do these types of tasks. (reply to 46860)

Erfan: i believe you should make a script connect to your wallet inside it and send the message to contract use cron to run the script on deadline (reply to 46861)

Nothing: how i can create a fun like this in tact  function receiveUSDT(uint256 amount) external {         require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");          // Transfer USDT from the sender to this contract         bool success = IERC20(usdtToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);         require(success, "USDT transfer failed");     }

Nothing: contract need a receive function of usdt(jetton)

sajad: I use this for transfer jetton (reply to 46777)

sajad: read this docs (reply to 46869)

Erfan: can i use a get method from another contract and wait for it's answer on ton blockchain?

/B4ckSl4sh\: No, you cannot call get methods onchain (reply to 46908)

Erfan: i need to check a value from a master contract for every call on sub contract sending a message to master contract and getting it back in form of a message. is this a bad idea? (reply to 46919)

Mo30: This is the only way (reply to 46921)

Erfan: but is it a bad idea? (reply to 46922)

Erfan: will the gas usage be to much?

Mo30: it costs every time (reply to 46923)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Depends on the amount of data you transfer (reply to 46924)

Erfan: imagine if master contract would get like 10k messages a day  will it become slow?

Mo30: you can add a extenal listener and update it value by api or external code (reply to 46924)

Erfan: i need this for frozen tokens part of tokens will be frozen and part of it can transfer

Erfan: on chain? (reply to 46928)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Are you planning to implement honeypot?) (reply to 46929)

Erfan: master contract is the minter and sub contracts are wallets

Erfan: no and sorry i don't know what that is (reply to 46932)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Anyway, in your scheme you can store a bool in every wallet that represents the ability of wallet to transfer funds. And this bool variable may be updated by master (reply to 46934)

Erfan: so i will have to update every wallet? (reply to 46935)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes (reply to 46936)

/B4ckSl4sh\: There is no better way to do that onchain

Erfan: ok man and thanks for answering (reply to 46938)

Mo30: create a separated contract for frozen tokens  and a contract for not frozen tokens for every user and hold value of frozen tokens in init function of it  on frozen contract add a method for withdrawing  and check if it withdrawing enabled Then check sender  with address of contractAddress(initOf UserContract(msg.wallet,msg.frozenAmount))  if sender is equal to this send frozenAmount to their contract or wallet (reply to 46929)

Erfan: but to unfroze i need to send a message to all contacts from the main contract? (reply to 46941)

Mo30: to your FrozenContract only  then tell to your users to withdraw (reply to 46942)

Erfan: i think i understood thank you (reply to 46943)

Nothing: who to listen event off chain

Bohdan: Hi, I'm trying to calculate storage fee according to this example  https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#computation-fees but I don't know what should I set for 'const size'? As I understand it, it should be the contract size, but where do I get it? Is it the size of the .tact file or .compiled.json or something else?

Rus: Hey. Thank you for the idea. I am experiencing some issues implementing it:  Suppose src jetton and dst jetton are of the same precision of 9 decimals.  Remind dst jetton amount = src jetton amount * exchange rate  Suppose I want to set exchange rate to 0.5 [dst/src]. I want 1 src token to be worth 0.5 dst tokens.  Since we can't work with decimal numbers, we must represent exchange rate with some precision based on both src and dst jetton decimals.  Let's set exchange rate to be 0.5 * 10^9 (9 decimals). Then: dst jetton amount = (src jetton amount * exchange rate) / 10^9  We must also divide src jetton amount * exchange rate by the "common" decimals for src jetton amount and exchange rate.  I am not sure if this value we divide by can be set as some constant and we may provide only exchange rate... (reply to 46325)

Rus: I think it is possible to hardcode the value we divide by to e.g. 10^9 and calculate exchange rate precision based on that then. (reply to 47069)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes, it's usually done by that (reply to 47071)

Rus: Btw, do you have some examples of how people do that? (reply to 47080)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Math stdlib will be soon available for tact, for now you can check funC math lib (reply to 47081)

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto%2Fsmartcont%2Fmathlib.fc (reply to 47081)

Rus: do you mean some particular function from mathlib?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Not really, there just was some interesting examples on fixed point numbers (reply to 47084)

Rus: Could you please make an announcement when the official tact jetton implementation is ready? (reply to 47085)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Of course) (reply to 47110)

jude: Hello guys I'm new here

jude: Why is there a Tact Language.  Is FunC and Fift not sufficient enough??

jude: Which language is this ? (reply to 46896)

Dr. Aria: Ah (reply to 47210)

jude: Which language is the best and recommended for writing smart contracts on TON blockchain?

Dr. Aria: because it made Working with TON network easier   Like comparing c and python (reply to 47208)

jude: So in this case Tact is like python.  More like how python syntax is easier than C ? (reply to 47213)

Dr. Aria: Yes  idk it was example (reply to 47214)

Rus: Is it normal that in the during the deployment I get 130 exit code?

Rus: Is it possible that one sends a JettonTransfer with amount set to 0?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes (reply to 47274)

/B4ckSl4sh\: There is no such rule (reply to 47270)

Dreon: I tried like in documents but in jetton transfer it did not work

Tea the Bottle: hi, may anyone explain me progress to let a user mint him self 1 NFT after finished 1 quest in my system ?

Tea the Bottle: User play game/ finish a quest and he have right for 1 NFT  X. How can I create NFT and send him mint transaction ? ( he must pay gas fee him self )

Iřřøďẽr: I have 2 questions.   Context:   Tact_code import { beginCell, Cell, contractAddress, StateInit, storeStateInit } from '@ton/core';  const [tonConnectUI] = useTonConnectUI();  const init = {     code: Cell.fromBase64('<CONTRACT_CODE>'),     data: Cell.fromBase64('<CONTRACT_INIT_DATA>') } satisfies StateInit;  const stateInit = beginCell()     .store(storeStateInit(init))     .endCell();  const address = contractAddress(0, init);  await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({     validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes     messages: [         {             address: address.toRawString(),             amount: '5000000',             stateInit: stateInit.toBoc().toString('base64')         }     ] });  This code is the standard for the deployment of a contract via a tonconnect.   1 question - what should I put in contract_code? I have an import of @stdlib/deploy in my code. Is it easy to insert it along with the rest of the code on the clock in this place?   2 question - what exactly and how to insert into contract_init_data? What is in the code under the word init? Or without that word? Can you show me an example, please?  As I understand it, the tact does not document how exactly the contract input data should be formed, so you need to look at the auto-gen wrappers. But that's the problem. I need to deploy the contract at the time of sending the transaction

Bohdan: Hi, in this example https://tact-by-example.org/06-unbounded-maps we don't use seqno or id for TokenChild, is it because we pass an owner address to TokenChild and it serves like unique identifier?

Yash: Hello everyone, As we are having a limit of 30000 entries in a map in Tact. Is the same limit applicable in FunC as well or not?

Dr. Aria: You should avoid use maps in TON Blockchain   that doesn't specified to language (reply to 47431)

Я̨kov: Yes, since this limit stems from the limits of the blockchain itself (reply to 47431)

Bohdan: @novusnota42 👍 - does it mean yes? ) (reply to 47430)

/B4ckSl4sh\: yes (reply to 47441)

Rus: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes/#36

Rus: Will the message bounce back in case we sent to the invalid destination address?  Suppose A sends message M to E (where E is invalid destination address).  Then we can catch the bounced<M> at A? (reply to 47447)

/B4ckSl4sh\: what is invalid destination? (reply to 47448)

Rus: If the destination address is invalid (reply to 47449)

Rus: e.g. it doesn’t conform to the relevant TL-B schemas, contains unknown workchain ID or it has invalid length for the given workchain

/B4ckSl4sh\: message will not be sent. you will get exit code 36

Rus: ok, thank you

Rus: What if the destination address was correct, but   e.g. I sent "hello" message, but the receiver does not support receiving "hello" messages.  A "hello" -> B  In this case the message will bounce from B to A?

Rus: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes/#130 (reply to 47454)

/B4ckSl4sh\: if you set bounceable flag - Yes (reply to 47454)

Rus: nice, thank you (reply to 47456)

John: Hi everyone, is there any example about how to upgrade wallet contract? For instance , the jetton minter only need to upgrade one contract, but there are too many jetton wallets, and the are called dynamically.

Bohdan: how can I measure my contract size?

Anton: you can check in the compilation report: look for a .md file produced by Tact  see e.g. https://t.me/tact_kitchen/21 (reply to 47463)

Rus: get fun pathId(         srcJetton: Address,         dstJetton: Address,     ): Int {         let path: Slice = beginCell()             .storeAddress(srcJetton)             .storeAddress(dstJetton)         .asSlice();          return sha256(path);  Why does this exit with https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes/#9?

Rus: Does the slice size must be divisible by 8 as well?

Rus: Seems to be so let path: Slice = beginCell()             .storeUint(parseStdAddress(srcJetton.asSlice()).address, 256)             .storeUint(parseStdAddress(dstJetton.asSlice()).address, 256)         .asSlice(); This helped (reply to 47474)

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math/#sha256 (reply to 47474)

Rus: Is it better to send 1 big message or 2 smaller messages?  I can divide them.

Никита: Hello everyone, I have encountered a problem that the hash that I receive from boc has not been looking for a transaction in tonview since yesterday. Has anyone else encountered this?

/B4ckSl4sh\: hash of the boc != transaction hash, moreover, you cannot get transaction hash if only thing you have is message boc (reply to 47549)

Никита: Based on the hash from boc, I could find the transaction in tonview, the problem is that since yesterday it stopped finding them. Here is an example of the code that found the cache and everything worked const transactionRes = await walletConnect.sendTransaction() const cell = Cell.fromBase64(transactionRes.boc) const buffer = cell.hash(); const hashHex = buffer.toString('hex'); // hashHex: 57123dffb9029bdaa9187b5d035737eea94a1b8c018e2ab1885f245eb95c6e30

/B4ckSl4sh\: They updated those methods and now it finds only transactions that are not in Blockchain yet (reply to 47552)

Никита: Yes, I noticed that only processed transactions can be found using it, but I found in the request https-tonapi.io-v2-traces in the inMsg property a hash by which you can search for a transaction

Никита: thanks btw

Никита: Can you please tell me where you found the information that they updated the method? (reply to 47554)

Rus: I've managed to fix it by removing the as remaining from the structure of my forwardPayload.  struct NotificationPayload {     jetton: Address;     type: Int as uint8;     payload: Slice; } If I set here the field payload to Slice as remaining I get bit builder overflow. Remind forwardPayload is Slice as remaining itself. (reply to 47286)

/B4ckSl4sh\: :) https://t.me/TonDevGang/7647 (reply to 47563)

Rus: I think this is because that payload field was too huge and overflowed the cell. Removing as remaining makes it be stored as a ref. (reply to 47564)

Никита: thx (reply to 47565)

P: Hi, everyone. How can we fix this compile error?    'Static function "log2" does not exist'    code: let logval: Int = log2(amount / 1000000000);

Ivan: Hey folks! 👋 I'm working with a TactCounter smart contract (code below), and I need some help crafting a working example to call the MyAdd method using sendTransaction via TON Connect.  The contract looks like this:   import "@stdlib/deploy";  message MyAdd {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as uint32; }  contract TactCounter with Deployable {     id: Int as uint32;     counter: Int as uint32;      init(id: Int) {         self.id = id;         self.counter = 0;     }      receive(msg: MyAdd) {         self.counter += msg.amount;     }      get fun counter(): Int {         return self.counter;     }      get fun id(): Int {         return self.id;     } }  Here's an example of a basic transaction with a comment:  const body = beginCell()   .storeUint(0, 32)   .storeStringTail("Hello, TON!")   .endCell();  await connector.sendTransaction({   validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 360,   messages: [     {       address: destination,       amount: toNano("0.05").toString(),       payload: body.toBoc().toString("base64")     }   ] });  I need to adapt this approach to send the MyAdd message, filling in queryId and amount fields properly. Can anyone help with the payload construction? 🙏  Thanks in advance! 😊

/B4ckSl4sh\: Check *yourcontract*.ts file in output directory. There you will find wrapper for sending MyAdd (reply to 47573)

Ivan: Thank you so much for the guidance! I managed to make it work by adding the op at the beginning of the cell manually. However, I’m planning to write a project in Dart/Flutter, where we don't have access to the wrappers generated by Tact.  Is there a way to calculate the op value programmatically ahead of time? (reply to 47583)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I guess the best solution is to specify op manually (reply to 47592)

Blockchain: When I call the CreateTicket contract, why does the same contract address get generated for each ticket creation, even though the _time value is variable?

Santosh: Hey guys, i have a master contract which calls a Jetton contract. Any error in the jetton contract bounces the message back to admin contract. Now i am trying to add a generic handler which will send the remaining balance back to the sender.

Nothing: how to deploy a contract from Another contract in tact

/B4ckSl4sh\: Or with bounceable true. Deployment will work anyway (reply to 47937)

Laisky: I just updated the tact template project tact-utils, adding a function to convert hash integers to hex, a fullSha256 on-chain function that doesn't truncate input parameters, and a function to verify the Merkle root on-chain.

Илья: Hi all, I have a contract that allows jettons to be taken out and a database that stores the allowed amount that can be taken out. How do I keep track so that those who are not stored in our database cannot call the contract. The database is on postgresql

Skuli: It doesn't work in web3 either. Your database is completely centralized. Can't you create a variable in the contract to store everyone's addresses? (reply to 47971)

Илья: I want users to invoke the contract themselves so I don't have to pay a fee for them. Is this even possible? What are the options?

Skuli: There are two options. Either you pay a commission or they pay a commission. (reply to 47973)

Илья: they pay a commission.

Илья: But then how do I get the information that they got jettons in postgresql when calling the contract

Skuli: May be this helped u I ask in Tact GPTs (reply to 47976)

Diego: Hi everyone, does anybody knows how Telegram’s Stars affect to receive TON on mini-apps? It’s just reading about it and I found that mini apps can ONLY receive stars so I’m confused here.

User<7118646036>: Hi guys, is there an example of a smart contract here that allows you to buy stars?

Zoroaster: Hi, as I know stars can subsequently be converted via Fragment and receive a Ton in return. As I understand this method bypassed the problems associated with implementing payment methods in the app. Thereby minimising the problems with regulators on the outside. As I understand it, Telegram circumvents this by the fact that stars are just an in-app purchase, like in-game purchases in games. All in all, something like that, if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me) (reply to 48264)

/B4ckSl4sh\: AFAIR it means that you cannot call get method for non-deployed contract (maybe you called get_wallet_data for non-deployed jetton wallet?) (reply to 48477)

Suhrad: GM Guys

Anton: @novusnota42 please look into this (reply to 48554)

/B4ckSl4sh\: It should be some api exit code, not tact-related (reply to 48558)

Я̨kov: Docs cover TON and Tact-specific exit codes, whilst the -13 you've encountered is most likely the one from Axios (used in @ton/ton) or some standard code from Node.js (reply to 48478)

Bohdan: Hi, I'm testing my dapp using orbs and testnet but from time to time requests to orbs fails with 504 error. Is it because of I use the testnet or the mainnet is also not so stable in orbs?

Илья: Somebody can help with checkSignature

Илья: always get false

Ivan: Hey everyone! I'm stuck with creating jetton content to initialize it from my smart contract. Is this even possible?  I've looked at the implementation in contract.deploy.ts but it seems like they adapted to TACT rather than the other way around =) Does anyone have a working example?  I tried creating:  struct JettonContent {     name: String;     symbol: String;     description: String;     image: String;     decimals: Int;    }  and calling .toCell() but it didn't work - since 0x00 needs to come first.

Anton: @B4ckSl4sh please take a look at it (reply to 48636)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You definitely misunderstood how structs in Tact work. Example of building onchain metadata in Tact can be found here https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/1115 . This is for nftCollection, but is works same for Jetton/NFT. Example of building onchain metadata for Jettons can be found here https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton/blob/main/sources/utils/jetton-helpers.ts#L18 (reply to 48636)

Tea the Bottle: hellp, I can not figure out what did I was wrong with this code:

Tea the Bottle: 0QB7ZWUcPrJvNcXebx26ufbiIvArUZPFh89j1jnIW29wbaQT   message(0x6017b34e) Mint {     query_id: Int as uint64;     nft_content: Cell;     receiver: Address }       receive(msg: Mint){         self.requireOwner();         require(self.next_item_index >= 0, "non-sequential NFTs");          let ctx: Context = context(); // get sender Info         let msgValue: Int = ctx.value;         let tonBalanceBeforeMsg: Int = myBalance() - msgValue;         let storageFee: Int = self.minTonsForStorage - min(tonBalanceBeforeMsg, self.minTonsForStorage);         msgValue = msgValue - (storageFee + self.gasConsumption);          let init: StateInit = initOf NftItem(self.next_item_index, myAddress(), self.owner, msg.nft_content);         let nft_item_address: Address = contractAddress(init);          // https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/send         send(             SendParameters{                 to: nft_item_address,                 value: msgValue,                 bounce: false,                 mode: SendIgnoreErrors,                 code: init.code, // initial code of the contract (the compiled bytecode)                 data: init.data, // initial data of the contract (arguments of init() function of the contract)                 body: Transfer {                     query_id: msg.query_id,                     new_owner: msg.receiver,                     response_destination: msg.receiver,                     custom_payload: emptyCell(),                     forward_amount: 0,                     forward_payload: emptySlice()                 }.toCell() // message body as a Cell             }         ); // Fields [code] and [data] are what's called an <init> package, which is used in deployments of new contracts.          self.nft_addresses.set(self.next_item_index, nft_item_address);         self.next_item_index = self.next_item_index + 1;     }

Tea the Bottle: may anyone help ?

Tea the Bottle: Im trying to create a mint mess allow owner mint NFT for selected address

Tea the Bottle: this is off chain mess:     await nftCollection.send(         provider.sender(),         {             value: toNano('0.2'),         },         {             $$type: 'Mint',             query_id: 0n,             nft_content: nftContentCell,             receiver: address('0QB7ZWUcPrJvNcXebx26ufbiIvArUZPFh89j1jnIW29wbaQT')         }     );

traceur: Hello guys, I’m using Tact’s Slice.hash to calculate slice hash https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-cells/#slicehash, but no matter what data I store in the slice, it always output the same hash. Does anyone know  why? My code is as below:  fun calculateExternalId(nonce: Int): Int {     let b: Builder = beginCell();     b.storeUint(nonce, 64);     b.storeUint(now(), 64);     return b.asSlice().hash(); }

Anton: The storeUint method has the following signature:  extends fun storeUint(self: Builder, value: Int, bits: Int): Builder;   it does not have mutates keyword so it just returns a new modified builder, it does not modify its self argument in-place  you need to change your function as follows:   fun calculateExternalId(nonce: Int): Int {     let b: Builder = beginCell();     b = b.storeUint(nonce, 64);     b = b.storeUint(now(), 64);     return b.asSlice().hash(); } (reply to 48756)

Я̨kov: Or even:  fun calculateExternalId(nonce: Int): Int {     return beginCell()     .storeUint(nonce, 64)     .storeUint(now(), 64)     .endCell()     .hash(); } (reply to 48760)

Anton: endCell() is an expensive operation (reply to 48761)

Я̨kov: Replaced with .asSlice()  UPD: Back to .endCell(), it was indeed better (reply to 48762)

Dr. Aria: .asSlice also calls endCell internally (reply to 48763)

Dr. Aria: why (reply to 48762)

Anton: it compiles down to the TVM ENDC instruction which costs 518 gas units (reply to 48765)

Anton: it depends on the datatype you work with, for Address it’s a no-operation (reply to 48764)

Dr. Aria: asSlice calls endCell too so how its cheaper than that? (reply to 48768)

Anton: you are right, I just forgot about that

Petr: Fift ASM code for both options for those who are interested:   $Foo$_fun_calculateExternalId PROCREF:<{ ;; asSlice       NEWC   64 STU       NOW   SWAP   64 STU   $Builder$_fun_asSlice INLINECALLDICT       HASHSU }> $Builder$_fun_asSlice PROCINLINE:<{       ENDC       CTOS }>  $Foo$_fun_calculateExternalId2 PROCREF:<{ ;; endCell       NEWC   64 STU       NOW   SWAP   64 STU       ENDC       HASHCU }>

Anton: afair, some hash operations can be used on builders directly

Dr. Aria: okay 👌🏻 (reply to 48770)

Petr: Looks like asSlice is even slower due to the additional CTOS here 🤔 (reply to 48771)

Petr: Moreover, HASHCU (in `endCell`) requires only 26 gas, while HASHSU requires 526 (https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/tvm/instructions)

Anton: for instance, HASHEXT_SHA256 might be a better approach here (if the choice of a hash function is not important): it works on builders too and costs 1/33 gas units per byte

Tea the Bottle: mocking from offchain that Owner can mint new NFT and direct send it to user's wallet (reply to 48757)

Tea the Bottle: will replace wallet address in code by input latter

Anton: 🎄 Merry Christmas, Folks!  As we wrap up 2024, it's time to celebrate all that we've accomplished together.  🚀 Adoption, Features and Tooling  Your biggest achievement this year was getting GitHub to support Tact on the entire website! We say you, because it wouldn't have been possible without you writing contracts, finding and reporting bugs & suggestions, and supporting Tact elsewhere ❤️  Regarding features and compiler updates, there were so many, that Tact has practically been reborn into a fresh, secure, easy and accessible language language for complex smart contracts, quick onboarding and fast prototyping.  In terms of tools, an awesome static analyzer Misti raised from 0 to hero: with over 25 issue detectors, CI/CD and Blueprint integrations. Additionally, the tree-sitter-tact and many editor packages and highlighting plugins were frequently updated to keep up with compiler updates.  📚 Documentation  Working on the clearest and most comprehensive documentation, we often had to dig deep into TON sources and discover what was really going on under the hood. And it was and is very worth it: the exit codes and assembly functions pages are the most vivid proofs.  We try to cater to both the experienced professionals and beginners on TON Blockchain, which is why you can expect more in-depth research of TVM, more production-ready examples of common contracts in Tact, and an even more streamlined onboarding experience ✈️  🐞 Bugfixes  The release 1.4.1 in particular squashed so many bugs, that the security audit of 1.5.0 went silky smooth — no critical vulnerabilities found, as announced on TON Gateway.  As for the next release, we're fixing the internal representation of Address type, reworking the type system to support more TVM types with the most safety and convenience, and making rapid strides to reduce the gas consumption 🛠  🎁 A Small Holiday Request  Finally, we have a small holiday wish: If you’ve enjoyed our progress this year, consider gifting us a GitHub star. It’s a simple gesture, but one that means the world to us. Your support helps Tact grow and reach even greater heights.  🎅 Happy holidays from the Tact team! ❤️ Take care, get some well-deserved rest and prepare for 2025 — we've got big plans for the next year  🍲 sparkling future ahead ♨️ @tact_kitchen (forwarded from Tact Kitchen)

Tea the Bottle: hello, Im stucking here:

Tea the Bottle: with this code, address show up was diff from my Ton keeper address

Tea the Bottle: let mnemonics = (process.env.mnemonics || "").toString();  console.log(mnemonics.split(" ")) let keyPair = await mnemonicToPrivateKey(mnemonics.split(" "));  // Create wallet contract let workchain = 0; // Usually you need a workchain 0 let wallet = WalletContractV5R1.create({ workchain, publicKey: keyPair.publicKey }); console.log(wallet.address);

Tea the Bottle: I can not figure out why from same mnemonics it was gave out 2 address

Aniruddh: Are you using the same exact wallet contract version in TON Keeper as the one in your code (WalletContractV5R1)? (reply to 48868)

Tea the Bottle: I try and V5 gave out diff address but V4 is ok (reply to 48872)

Tea the Bottle: I switched wallet V5 to V4 (reply to 48879)

Tea the Bottle: V4 is better because most docs was written for V4

Tea the Bottle: yes, Im working on this. Passed that problem.

Martin: Can someone help me? I have a deployed token (using the standard, @interface("org.ton.jetton.wallet")). I tested the transfer functionality, and everything worked before. However, now users cannot send tokens to each other. As I understand, this is due to forwardTonAmount() that Tonkeeper sets to 1 by default. When I test the script without forwardTonAmount, the transaction goes through, but with this value, an error occurs. What should I do?

Nerses: As in the TON blockchain, a wallet is also a smart contract, and if it hasn't been used for a long time, the next operation from the wallet incurs higher fees. I want to understand if this behavior also applies to other smart contracts — will the fees be higher if the last call to the contract was a long time ago?

Dr. Aria: yes (reply to 49154)

Nerses: thnx a lot (reply to 49155)

Yavər: I'm working on Testnet but I got this issue, testnet slowdown or something else ?

djan: hello,  may i ask how to get blocks sequence in tact smart contract?

Yavər: on your own contract, you need to create 'seq' value then you should get it. on other smart contract, check its code if it has seqno value and get function (reply to 49164)

Yavər: you can do nothing, u need to make your own smart contract (reply to 49148)

djan: thanks for your help, i thought rely on current block number, now i foud it's best practice is to  rely on the current time instead.  reference: https://tact-by-example.org/04-current-time (reply to 49165)

Nerses: in func there is accept_message()  which has some effects on tx fees, is there smth like that in tact  or maybe under the hood of receive() is called it ?

/B4ckSl4sh\: accept_message have a meaning only in external messages, so receive() does not call it (reply to 49185)

Although, you can, as @B4ckSl4sh mentioned, clone the repo and build it locally, or just install it from github using npm. That kind of beta-testing would be very much appreciated.

SynthLuvr: Thanks I'll take a look. I don't see any update in the repo regarding #27 contract upgrades (reply to 49273)

Anton: there are some workarounds, but we are going to solve this issue in a few weeks (reply to 49286)

SynthLuvr: I wonder this as well. Upgrading the parent contract is straightforward. But when there could be thousands of wallet contracts deployed, how do you go about upgrading them? (reply to 47458)

— 2024-12-29 —

John: Maybe let users do manual upgrade? (reply to 49289)

SynthLuvr: Yes of course, but there's much more complexity than that. You need to be able to determine how the upgrade works and what it's being upgraded to. That's quite a challenging problem

SynthLuvr: I've got upgrades working via Tact and locally the tests work, but on testnet it's failing with "Not a cell: null"

SynthLuvr: The problematic part is setting the data setData(msg.data); nativeThrow(0);

SynthLuvr: Did anyone find a solution for this? (reply to 28816)

Made by: gh issue has a full description of how to handle this (reply to 49465)

SynthLuvr: I didn't see a working solution in github. I saw proposed solutions, none of which work. Or is there another issue with more discussion? (reply to 49466)

Made by: issue describes general ways to make an upgrade, but unfortunately there's no "native" way to do this in tact rn. Because you should define some transition mechanism between states of your storage, you shoud create temporary migration function to do so. But I haven't tried it, it's just an idea of implementation. Imho there should me some Migration entity as a part of a language to define transitions between storage states like in good old sql databases (reply to 49467)

Made by: code upgrading is working fine btw (reply to 49467)

SynthLuvr: Yes code upgrade is fine, it's the data upgrade that's problematic (reply to 49469)

SynthLuvr: Updating the data values seems fine too. Specifically what seems problematic is modifying the shape of the data (reply to 49474)

ed: Don't touch the existing shape, add something like reserveData: Cell field, which you would utilize later on for/with possible upgrades, manually parsing additional new data (reply to 49475)

Hunter: how to verify user's ton address is correct or wrong using python ?

Hunter: without api request (reply to 49946)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Use pythoniq_core for example. There is address class that validates address when creating class instance (reply to 49946)

Thomas: EXPERIMENTAL MODEL FOR LOAD BALANCING IN CLOUD COMPUTING  USING THROTTLED ALGORITHM   Can anyone help with this please

SynthLuvr: Thank you for this. It's working great. One issue though is that Cell can only hold primitive types, so an upgrade is unable to add new composite type data (reply to 49499)

Mr Shark: Guy, apparently you don’t have all the information (reply to 50291)

Pedro: why createpost bounces here tho? https://paste.debian.net/1342438/ the tx bounces between my v4r2 to my jetton wallet, however i have createPost func in jetton master and other receivers... Been stuck in this for a while, appreciate some quick help here pls

nonam3e: Both are real, the first one is private (reply to 50291)

Pedro: considering this jetton template: https://github.com/nikandr-surkov/Sample-Ton-Jetton-Contract/blob/master/contracts/sample_jetton.tact  Why when I send ton to the jetton master it bounces back to my v4r2 wallet?

/B4ckSl4sh\: With what opcode you send a message? (reply to 50364)

Pedro: 0x0f8a7ea5

/B4ckSl4sh\: It's jetton transfer. It should be sent to jettonWallet. It is not eth. https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons#jetton-architecture (reply to 50366)

Pedro: I've been all over that page... I already tried to send to jettonWallet address and it bounces as well.

Pedro: I don't know perhaps some definition on TokenInternal, TokenInternalTransfer on that particular jetton template? Or is it fine?

Pedro: I already tried to send TON just like that:  // Constructing the message body for the transaction         const payload = beginCell()         .endCell();      const transaction = {         validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 360,         messages: [             {                 address: jettonMasterAddress.toString(),                 amount: toNano('0.1').toString(),                  payload: payload.toBoc().toString('base64'),             }         ]     };  and it bounces back, same behavior

/B4ckSl4sh\: Maybe just try different one? (reply to 50369)

Pedro: Which one?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Calculate JettonWallet that belongs to your walletv4r2 and send to it (reply to 50370)

Pedro: const wallet = useTonWallet() const userAddress = Address.parse(wallet.account.address);             const jettonMaster = client.open(JettonMaster.create(jettonMasterAddress));              const jettonWalletAddress = await jettonMaster.getWalletAddress(userAddress);             const jettonWalletContract = client.open(JettonWallet.create(jettonWalletAddress));

Pedro: doesnt work...

Pedro: bounces

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes/#130 (reply to 50379)

Pedro: men.... i've been getting 130 with many different code I tested...

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton  Try with this one

Pedro: https://github.com/nikandr-surkov/Sample-Ton-Jetton-Contract/blob/master/contracts/sample_jetton.tact  this one works, it does create the jetton properly. Can't you see the contract and check if something there is blocking such thing?

Pedro: I mean, I can't see no difference between yours and that one

/B4ckSl4sh\: well. Actually yes. Maybe you've deployed wrong code? idk (reply to 50383)

Pedro: Will try with your repo

Pedro: indeed... (reply to 50389)

Pedro: B4ckSl4sh can you take a look at this, https://paste.debian.net/1342479/ i am trying to send ton to my jetton master thru frontend using tonconnect. The tx is bouncing

/B4ckSl4sh\: Do not send tx to jettonMaster. Send to JettonWallet and share tx link (reply to 50399)

Pedro: bounces too..   https://testnet.tonscan.org/tx/90e6c26bba4e404dab5fa6d89a292d8879769764dc188ed116b52b252ab39971

Pedro: I changed to: messages: [      {          address: jettonWalletAddress.toString(),          ...

/B4ckSl4sh\: Incorrect opcode

Pedro: yes but see the code, i dont know where that opcode comes from

Pedro: im using the right one  .storeUint(0xf8a7ea5, 32) // JettonTransfer opcode

/B4ckSl4sh\: Probably error is somewhere else. Try act.ghwnd.cc to test your contract (reply to 50453)

Pedro: im using default tact-lang/jetton

Pedro: the code i am giving you is front-end.

Pedro: i havent changed anything from the standard... How hard is it to send ton to a jetton master or even jetton wallet lol

Pedro: I dont even know how I am supposed to test a jetton transfer on act.ghwnd.cc

Pedro: mad confusing UI/UX there

/B4ckSl4sh\: I understand. And I think that your problem is there (reply to 50457)

Pedro: it's only 46 lines that I sent you lol

/B4ckSl4sh\: But opcode in your tx is incorrect lol (reply to 50462)

Pedro: can you spot something wrong in the code instead?

Pedro: I was able to make it work....

Pedro: https://testnet.tonscan.org/tx/6140badc3b649dadcee2e7cab0830d4d06c511eb356791bc544dc0134689b01f

Pedro: There are a lot of docs saying it needs internal messages, well seems it doesnt..

Pedro: B4ckSl4sh if you are around, can you take a quick look at this? https://paste.debian.net/1342562/  I am triggering a cell underflow though not sure what i am missing when parsing the message from the frontend. It is getting the right opcode, here's a tx

Pedro: https://testnet.tonscan.org/tx/fb59445d88aea1492574a2b99485af25432580e8b3dfeb8ff0bf25690965368c

Pedro: spotted one thing, should use loadRef().beginParse();`instead of `beginParse()

Pedro: not really, loadRef() is on the frontend, in the contract is only beginParse because Type "Cell" does not have a function named "loadRef"

Pedro: can you take a second look please

/B4ckSl4sh\: I think you need .beginParse().loadRef() (reply to 50520)

Pedro: let _img_url: Cell   = msg.imageURL.beginParse().loadRef();  Invalid type "Cell" for argument "cell"

/B4ckSl4sh\: You probably don't understand what you are doing (reply to 50524)

Pedro: imageURL comes from the frontend parsed as such:  .storeRef(beginCell().storeStringTail(formData.imageUrl).endCell())  my receiver (which receives from the frontend) Is trying to store such value.

Pedro: you mentioned beginParse().loadRef() but that seems frontend syntax from ton/core and not tact ?  I really dunno lol

Pedro: as you work at tact perhaps can clear whats wrong

Pedro:  .beginParse().loadRef() thats not even valid my friend.

Pedro: and loadRef.beginParse() is frontend

Pedro: I am still stuck on the same issue after giving it several tries, perhaps i am missing something minor, updated code: https://paste.debian.net/1342588/ Exit code: cell underflow.  I'd appreciate someone that can actually look at that short snippet of code and tell me what's wrong codewise (some explanation would be cool)

SynthLuvr: Error indicates the cells aren't being parsed correctly. Is there a reason you're doing the parsing manually? It's safer to use structs (reply to 50563)

B74849🤬🤬: Hello. Please tell me how to send a Mint message from a contract to JettonMaster, which I made using minter ton org? I changed the owner of the token to the address of my contract. But I can’t figure out how to make the correct body message now. In my ts code I do this - static mintMessage(from: Address, to: Address, jetton_amount: bigint, forward_ton_amount: bigint, total_ton_amount: bigint, query_id: number | bigint = 0) {     const mintMsg = beginCell().storeUint(0x178d4519, 32)                                    .storeUint(0, 64)                                    .storeCoins(jetton_amount)                                    .storeAddress(null)                                    .storeAddress(from) // Response addr                                    .storeCoins(forward_ton_amount)                                    .storeMaybeRef(null)                     .endCell();          return beginCell().storeUint(21, 32).storeUint(query_id, 64) // op, queryId                           .storeAddress(to)                           .storeCoins(total_ton_amount)                           .storeCoins(jetton_amount)                           .storeRef(mintMsg)                .endCell();     }     async sendMint(provider: ContractProvider, via: Sender, to: Address, jetton_amount: bigint, forward_ton_amount: bigint, total_ton_amount: bigint) {         if(total_ton_amount <= forward_ton_amount) {             throw new Error("Total ton amount should be > forward amount");         }         await provider.internal(via, {             sendMode: SendMode.PAY_GAS_SEPARATELY,             body: JettonMinter.mintMessage(this.address, to, jetton_amount, forward_ton_amount, total_ton_amount),             value: total_ton_amount + toNano('0.015'),         });     }.

Anton: https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact (reply to 50799)

jay: I have developed a tool for issuing SBTs. You’re welcome to connect your testnet wallet and give it a try!  https://sbt-hub.vercel.app/

jay: It includes an SBT implementation written in Tact, utilizing on-chain metadata.

Anton: Is your SBT implementation open-source? (reply to 50842)

jay: Not yet, it’s modified based on the SBT template from getgems.

Nerses: Can you provide an example of an external message? The documentation states that an external message is one sent from outside the blockchain to the blockchain, but what are some specific scenarios where this occurs?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Check out code of any wallet (reply to 50847)

Nerses: Will the message sent from wallet to contract A be external message for A ? In docs it is stated like that,so I wonder how should be handled accept_message in receive ?Most probably I am confusing smth (reply to 50848)

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/external/#messages-have-to-be-accepted-manually (forwarded from /B4ckSl4sh\)

/B4ckSl4sh\: There will be two messages - one external to wallet and one internal from wallet to A (reply to 50849)

Nerses: can this flow be used to attack smart contracts ?   https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/accept-message-effects#internal-message:~:text=of%20bounce%20messages.-,EXAMPLE,-For%20instance%2C%20if

/B4ckSl4sh\: Well, maybe i'm wrong and acceptMessage() may be called for internal message, but i've never seen this technique because it is nearly never applied (reply to 50856)

Nerses: got it.Is there any other way to be sure that this isnt attack flow ? I meant any platform to ask or someone who knows exactly (reply to 50864)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Just don't use acceptMessage or setGasLimit in receivers, until you are 100% know what you are doing, and everything will be okay (reply to 50865)

Ali: Hey everyone!  On the EVM side, transactions can theoretically be reversed. Therefore, when building structures that include central systems such as bridges or CEX, we wait for Transaction Finality for the relevant transaction and if there are enough approvals, we record the relevant transaction in the backend.  Is TON Blockchain has kinda same think? How do we understand that the transaction is confirmed and cannot be reversed?

Nerses: How can storage optimization be approached in TON compared to EVM? In EVM, storage is structured slot by slot (32 bytes), making it efficient to organize data types like bytes32, bytes20, and bytes10 sequentially (e.g., bytes32, bytes20, bytes10 instead of bytes20, bytes32, bytes10). However, in TON, storage is based on a cell tree structure. Does this mean there are no similar considerations for storage efficiency in TON?

Nerses: Is the Tact-lang/compiler version 1.5.3 backward compatible with version 1.4.1 ?

Anton: It should be, modulo fixing bugs or unintended behavior (reply to 50887)

Anton: Yep, it is totally different (reply to 50882)

Nerses: thanks a lot (reply to 50888)

Nerses: Can gasConsumed or myStorageDue in TACT be used in production smart contracts, or are they still under development?

Anton: both are available since Tact 1.5 and can be (and should be) used in production (reply to 50898)

Nerses: are there any examples of usage ? (reply to 50901)

Nerses: For example, gasConsumed is intended to indicate how much gas has been used so far (as stated in the documentation, it includes the gas used by the calling function itself). Can it be used to determine the gas consumption before a specific line of code?

/B4ckSl4sh\: With some limitations, yes. You will have to count tvm assembly instructions that were executed before gasConsumed(). Not that gas consumption may differ for same instructions, depending on other things (for example beginParse() consume 100 gas on fist parsing of cell, and 25 gas on futher calls (with same cell as argument)) (reply to 50905)

/B4ckSl4sh\: In most cases using @ton/sandbox with tvm logging enabled will solve gas-counting problems (reply to 50905)

Nerses: for unique ID generation I use such method in EVM keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, address(this), block.chainid));  is there a way to achieve this in TON,that even for validators cant be predictable (for example timestamp cant be changed by validator as consensus will not accept)

Ali: fun generateId(): Int {         let data: StringBuilder = beginString();         data.append(sender().toString());         data.append(now().toString());         data.append(myAddress().toString());         return sha256(data.toString());     }   check this out (reply to 50914)

Nerses: this will work,thanks for assistance,but I was seeking for more gas effective approach (in this method the computation fee will increase) (reply to 50916)

Ali: I dont have any ideas about reducing gas, i hope it works for you.

Zoroaster: Hi guys, I'm just starting to dive into this area and would like to ask you guys if it makes sense to learn Tact rather than FunC right away. I've taken a small course on Tact, but I'm not quite sure where to get more knowledge and if Tact-a is really enough. I'd also like to understand what application tasks I can use these skills in. I want to write my first project that will allow me to buy telegram stars through smart contracts, but I don't know how to do it, where to start and whether it can be done only through Tact. I myself am a mobile developer on Flutter and this area is really very new to me, so if you could give me a hint I would be very grateful.

Anton: You can deploy a new contract by sending it a message with its initial code and data (reply to 50977)

Ali: In my contract, when i send some token with EVM address as a comment, EVM address value is completely blank in the transfer exit code. What could be wrong in here?   message BridgeDepositEvent {     amount: Int as coins;     address: Address;     bridgeId: Int as uint256;     evmAddress: Slice as remaining; }      receive(msg: JettonTransferNotification) {         require(             sender() == self.jettonWalletAddress,             "Notification not from your jetton wallet!"         );          self.myJettonAmount += msg.amount;         let newId = self.generateBridgeId();          emit(BridgeDepositEvent{             amount: msg.amount,             address: sender(),             bridgeId: newId,             evmAddress: msg.forwardPayload,         }.toCell());          self.bridgeNonce += 1;          // Forward excesses         self.forward(msg.sender, null, false, null);     }

Anton: Does the incoming message have non-empty forwardPayload field? (reply to 51016)

Ali: nope, here is my transfer code   function prepareTokenTransferMessage(     amount: bigint,     destination: Address,     responseDestination: Address,     forwardTonAmount: bigint,     evmAddress: string ) {          const forwardPayload = beginCell()         .storeUint(0, 32) // op code 0 for simple text message         .storeStringTail(evmAddress) // Store EVM address as a string         .endCell();      return beginCell()         .storeUint(0xf8a7ea5, 32) // op code for token transfer         .storeUint(0, 64) // query_id         .storeCoins(amount) // Token amount to transfer         .storeAddress(destination) // Bridge contract address         .storeAddress(responseDestination) // Sender's address for the response         .storeBit(false) // No custom payload         .storeCoins(forwardTonAmount) // TON amount for forwarding         .storeBit(true) // forward_payload is included         .storeRef(forwardPayload) // Include forwardPayload with EVM address         .endCell(); }

Nerses: I have a wallet address with a balance and the corresponding mnemonic, but I'm unable to recreate the exact wallet with its balance using Tonkeeper. Could this issue be related to differences in wallet contract versions (e.g., w5 beta, w5, or others)?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yes (reply to 51022)

Nerses: is there a way to handle it ? As in block explorer i see my balance but in wallet versions for every version it shows 0 balance https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/0QBWRYE3_suXo4Ihtii5ZP4KTgY8bJ5ZRgCvxi5LqpJ7UO_H#source (reply to 51026)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Idk. Looks like it is correct v5 wallet (reply to 51028)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Where did you create it?

/B4ckSl4sh\: In Mytonwallet?

Nerses: I used tonkeeper (reply to 51030)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Then Idk😢 (reply to 51032)

Семен: Hello everyone. I'm making web application - UI tool for contracts based on Tact ABI. Initially i was studied of making smart contracts on Tact and made jetton on Tact with minter app for it, but i improved application. Now it load ABI from TON Verifier and build UI with contract interface.  At the moment MVP compatible with jetton master contract is ready. In future i will add support for every ABI type. If someone want to contibute it will be awesome  Here is github repo: https://github.com/supadupadao/minter  And here is example of UI for jetton master in deployed application: https://minter.supadupa.space/manage/kQC1I2HcAkUSfMCQCezbL9bVtC_kqnX-gQIToAqXJNTP7yVj

Amirhossein: Does anyone here work professionally with cocos creator?

Nerses: In what cases smart contract throws Null reference exception exit code ?

Amirhossein: For 2d game development with typescript (reply to 51060)

Nerses: In previous versions of TACT it wasnt possible to assign value to struct,can it be done in version 1.5.3 ?         let reward: Reward = Reward {                 amount: 0,                 timelock: 0         };                  if(self.rewards.exists(msg.Id)){             reward = self.rewards.get(msg.Id)!!;         }

Anton: Yep, should be possible. Please let us know if there is any issue with that (reply to 51063)

Denis S: Hey, TON Friends.   We are building MemeIndex DAO analytic platform with DEX and DeFi tools as contribution to TON Ecosystem.

Vincent: hi tact builders. how the complier make a tact contract to the op code? I saw in my built file, the op code is generate automatically, so how does this opcode be calculated?

Anton: Hi, the opcode is either specified at the point of message declaration:   message(0xFFFF) Foo {     // <— here in parens    … // fields }   or if it’s not specified, the Tact compiler computes it using the textual representation of the message declaration like so: name + "{" + fields.join(",") + “}”, then it’s hashed with sha256 and and only the first 32 bits of the hash are taken.  You can also get that computed value from the compilation report Tact produces (look for a .md file in the build folder). (reply to 51093)

Vincent: In my case, my function name is "SwapNativeInStonfiV2" (reply to 51095)

Vincent: how to calculate to 1718339489?

Vincent: the HEX is 0x666bc7a1

Anton: just the name is not enough, you need to combine the message name + TLB representations of the message fields + convert it to a string and feed into the newMessageOpcode function  here is how newMessageOpcode function is implemented:  https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/408995bc0c824059f74a2fd7e259997bc9d0620f/src/types/resolveSignatures.ts#L276  here is how that combining is done https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/src/types/resolveSignatures.ts#L193-L196 (reply to 51097)

Anton: on the other hand, if you are trying to interface with Ston.fi, then all the opcodes should be fixed and documented in their docs

Anton: you might want to check out this page in the Tact docs: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/dexes/stonfi

Sapperava: Hey guys. Can you please tell me when it is planned to introduce upgradeability in Tact?

Anton: it is planned, yes, you can check for workarounds and track progress here: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/27 (reply to 51103)

Александр: It is possible through FunC injection but not so convinient (reply to 51103)

Sapperava: great, thank you. will there be some kind of backward compatibility mechanism? If I write contracts based on the current version now, can they be updated later? (reply to 51104)

Sapperava: thank you, right now I'm looking more at the architectural aspect of what needs to be incorporated into the project than the implementation aspect itself) (reply to 51105)

Anton: unfortunately, we cannot provide guarantees on the format of the contract storage, although, we will try our best to provide some kind of escape hatch, for instance, in the form of a tact.config.json option that recovers previous behavior (reply to 51106)

Suraj Yadav | Decentralized Guild: GM G, I have a question for Tact/TON roadmap  if  I have to onboard a new user or a beginner in TON ecosystem. What should be the roadmap for him/her?  Assume: He/She have basic programming knowledge and concepts

Anton: I would suggest reading tact-by-example.org for now. It’s a bit outdated but still a very good example-driven resource (reply to 51109)

Sapperava: maybe there are common patterns in Tact to abstract the storage and then replace only the implementation of methods that work with the data? (reply to 51108)

Anton: for instance, now the contract storage has the “lazy loading” bit at the beginning and the dictionary of the code cells of the child contracts, but this is a subject to change in the next version, since it is more gas efficient and we are currently implementing a series of gas optimizations (reply to 51111)

Sapperava: ok, sounds good. thank you (reply to 51112)

Nerses: In my contract, users send funds to lock them, and after some time, the funds are released. To ensure the same amount is released, I use ctx.value to fix the amount sent by the user during locking. However, this creates an issue because ctx.value includes the gas cost, meaning the contract balance ends up being less than the fixed amount. As a result, when releasing funds, the user could receive more than the actual balance of the contract. Is there any method or approach to handle this issue and exclude the gas cost from ctx.value or ensure accurate fund handling?

Dmitrii: Hello guys, how do handle this issue, i import helper functions from my code, but generated ts is full of ts errors:   #13 29.00 ../contract/build/Moneypot/tact_JettonMasterTemplate.ts(65,21): error TS7006: Parameter 'src' implicitly has an 'any' type.

/B4ckSl4sh\: In this case user may send you TONs and specify the amount they want to lock in message. You will take needed TONs and send remaining back. Example of this approach can be seen in dedust, when swapping tons to jettons. (reply to 51117)

Dmitrii: and i don’t wanna loose my strict tsconfig

Nerses: Great seems this is really solution. If you are familiar with dedust could you point me the mentioned code ? (reply to 51121)

/B4ckSl4sh\: What functions are you importing? You need messages (types) and just Send function. Or I misunderstood (reply to 51120)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Unfortunately dedust has closed source code so I can't point it :(. But maybe this page will help you https://docs.dedust.io/recipes/write-a-func-contract-to-swap-ton-to-scale-and-send-to-recipient (reply to 51123)

Nerses: I wanted to explore how Dedust handles fixing the amount and sending back the remainder, as gas-related issues might arise. Should I send the remaining amount with a value of 0 and use the mode SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors to ensure that the fixed amount + gas + returned amount equals ctx.value? (reply to 51124)

Suraj Yadav | Decentralized Guild: What if we start a video format to explain in regional language as we discussed with you during Gurugram TON Bootcamp (reply to 51110)

/B4ckSl4sh\: SendIgnoreErrors are not required actually. But yes, this will work (reply to 51126)

Nerses: thanks for clarification and assistance (reply to 51128)

Anton: That would be great, the Tact team does not have the capacity to work on it at this point, but would be happy to support you otherwise (reply to 51127)

Suraj Yadav | Decentralized Guild: We will try our best (reply to 51130)

Dmitrii: i need message builder functions (reply to 51124)

Nerses: In my contract, funds are deposited, and I want to lock a fixed amount specified by the depositor (msg.amount). How can I send back the remaining amount (ctx.value - msg.amount - all paid fees) ? I used the following code:  nativeReserve(myBalance() - ctx.value + msg.amount, 0);  send(SendParameters{     to: sender(),     value: ctx.value - msg.amount,     mode: 0,     body: Excesses{}.toCell(), }); However, it doesn't seem to work. What could be the issue?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Use nativeReserve + SendRemainingBalance (reply to 51149)

B74849🤬🤬: Guys, how to track tonconnect/ui-react events, by type like in tonconnect/ui? I've already broken my head

Bohdan: give the link please (reply to 51160)

— 2025-01-10 —

Nerses: i used the method like you mentioned             nativeReserve(myBalance() - ctx.value + msg.amount, SendRemainingBalance);              send(SendParameters{                 to: sender(),                 value: ctx.value - msg.amount,                 mode: 0,                 body: Excesses{}.toCell(),             });  but it threw error 5 (integer out of expected range) . here is the tx https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/38adfcebeeb42aaa7a39f643afd315cd8f0c4b5eddc9aa7aa3e0f4ffbde2cfc4    I think it occurs because of behavior Beware, that all message sending functions of Tact can change the actual contract’s balance, but they won’t update the value returned by this function. . what you think of this ? (reply to 51157)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I think that you misunderstood my message. Native reserve is good, leave it untouched. Just send a message with SendRemainingBalance, not SendRemainingValue (reply to 51209)

Nerses: got it thanks a lot (reply to 51211)

{ дүние } ақырет: Guys, Hello everyone! I need the help.  How can I compare two strings and check how many the chars are same in the same indexes?  Btw I am creating the smart contract, which will be like "Quiz Contract", which have the answers and should check how many answers are correct and send it, like the message.   If you have some advices or suggestions, I'll be feel well.

Nerses: is it good practise to hard code storage fee in smart contract ? or is there better way to make message sender to pay for storage fees ?

Nerses: I need to modify my contract so that the user pays for the storage fees, and the remaining value is sent back to them. How can this be achieved (perhaps using myStorageDue())? Currently, I use the following code to return the remaining value:  send(SendParameters{     to: sender(),     value: 0,     mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,     body: Excesses{}.toCell(), });  However, in this setup, my contract ends up paying for the storage fees. How can I fix this?

/B4ckSl4sh\: In any case, storage fees will be payed from your balance (reply to 51223)

/B4ckSl4sh\: SendRemainingValue should work correctly in this case (reply to 51223)

Nerses: I have an idea to use nativeReserve and myStorageDue so it will be payed by message sender (reply to 51224)

/B4ckSl4sh\: SendRemainingValue will handle it (reply to 51226)

Nerses: I will try it out now thanks (reply to 51227)

Nerses: seems that version doesnt work . here is the tx https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/05f7086b40e3af52c7288fe758623437c7dc8f26b289be5884f4e9e1133c27bd  it take out as much from contract balance as the storage fee is (reply to 51227)

Nerses: here you can see that balance of contract was 1 ton before that sent message after it balance is reduced as much as storage fee need to be paid for sending the message

/B4ckSl4sh\: Hm, let me check (reply to 51230)

Nerses: you can pm me in case you need any additional info (reply to 51231)

/B4ckSl4sh\: If user will send bounceable message to you, it should work correctly (reply to 51230)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Don't ask me why - I don't know

/B4ckSl4sh\: I think even guys from TON Core don't know why does it work like that

Nerses: and it is super strange (reply to 51237)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I know. But it is 100% true https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ea0dc161639ef2640876d6de06f7224ac5873847/validator/impl/validate-query.cpp#L5553-L5571 (reply to 51238)

Nerses: @AntonTrunov maybe you know why it works so ?

Nerses: here for a lil bit context (reply to 51235)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I asked TON Core about it, maybe someone will share why does it work like that))))))))))) (reply to 51242)

Nerses: I have tested.Yeah it worked like you mentioned previously (reply to 51244)

/B4ckSl4sh\: But you can fix it anyway. Just nativeReserve storage fee in case of unbounceable message arrived (reply to 51245)

Nerses: I tried but wasnt able to do that. What you think using nativeReserve will keep more funds in case of bounceable message ? (reply to 51246)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Hm, but I don't exactly know how to check in Tact if the incoming message is bounceable (reply to 51246)

/B4ckSl4sh\: @Gusarich any ideas?

Nerses: I used nativeReserve(mybalance() + storageDue(),0)  but it threw exit code 37 (gas error) (reply to 51246)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Well, that is the solution too. Not ideal, but still a solution (reply to 51249)

/B4ckSl4sh\: MyBalance() includes incoming message value (reply to 51252)

/B4ckSl4sh\: so something like nativeReserve(myBalance() + storageDue() - context().value, 0) should work (reply to 51252)

Nerses:         nativeReserve(myBalance() - context().value + myStorageDue(), 0);          send(SendParameters{                     to: sender(),                     value: 0,                     mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,                     body: Excesses{}.toCell(),                 }); used that and send bouncable message again the issue raised.🤦‍♂️ (reply to 51255)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Well, you can throw in case of unbounceable message ahahah (reply to 51256)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Or just ignore it

/B4ckSl4sh\: Your contract will freeze only on -0.1 TONs

Nerses: the problem is that the contract is created for swaps.so having such issue means that someone else will pay instead of others (reply to 51260)

BAKU: Hello everyone, what could be the problem? More precisely, what do errors 9 -130 mean when sending a transaction to a contract, the money comes in but returns automatically with these errors

/B4ckSl4sh\: Hmmmmm, maybe you should add one more myStorageDue in case incoming message is unbounceable (reply to 51256)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I still don't know how to check it in tact thought (reply to 51264)

/B4ckSl4sh\: @NersesA try context().bounced (reply to 51265)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Maybe it is misspelled idk, should be bounce, not bounced  Or you can parse manually from context().raw (reply to 51266)

Nerses: I will try now (reply to 51267)

Илья: Hi all, please tell me what can be the problem. If I leave the message Slice, then why the error 9 Cell underflow comes out. But if I remove it, everything is normal and there are no errors.  message code: message (0x972c818e) SendTokens {     timestamp: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     signature: Slice; }  send message: def get_send_jettons(contract_address: str, transfer_fee: int, jettons_amount: int):     timestamp = int(time.time())     signature_data = begin_cell().store_uint(timestamp, 64).store_coins(jettons_amount).end_cell()     signature = sign_message(signature_data.hash, bytes.fromhex(PRIVATE_KEY))     signature_cell = begin_cell().store_bytes(signature).end_cell()     data = {         'address': contract_address,         'amount': str(transfer_fee),         'payload': urlsafe_b64encode(             begin_cell()                 .store_uint(0x972c818e, 32)                 .store_uint(timestamp, 64)                 .store_coins(jettons_amount)                 .store_slice(signature_cell.to_slice())                 .end_cell()                 .to_boc()         ).decode()     }          return data

BAKU: ? (reply to 51263)

Daniil: first thing that comes to mind is parsing in_msg_full cell (reply to 51250)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yeah, but how that can be retrieved in Tact? (reply to 51273)

Daniil: sadly, context() only has a slice of this cell with bounce flag skipped. and as far as I know incoming message is not stored anywhere else (reply to 51274)

Nerses: is there any differences on signing and signature verifying between wallet version w4 and w5r1 ?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Afair yes, message for v4r2 won't fit for W5 (reply to 51280)

Nerses: is there any solution for that ? for example to make applicable one version signature for another (reply to 51283)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Why do you need that? (reply to 51285)

Nerses: User signs of chain and signature is verified on smart contract.That worked previously when I used w4 wallet but same code doesn't works for w5 (reply to 51287)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I still don't really understand (reply to 51288)

Nerses: I used script to sign message (wallet w4) that message should be verified by contract so that it will know specific user has signed it.All that worked in w4 but now in wallet w5 it doesn't work.I mean signing with wallet w5 (reply to 51292)

Alex: Good day. I have a question, a number of transactions in the application can sometimes fall under the category of suspicious. The question is, can the choice of the programming language of the bot that uses the smart contract for transactions affect the quality of operations? That is, for example, my bot is written in Python and some transactions have a suspicious sign. However, if I write Here in JavaScript, this sign disappears. Can this really make sense, or is it still a matter of the operation and organization of the transactions themselves in the Tact FanС language.. and the choice of programming language for the Bot does not matter?

/B4ckSl4sh\: All you mentioned does not matter at all (reply to 51346)

Alex: Ok, but why the suspicious transactions appear? Only, because neural network of ton-network dreams about some internal parameters or frequency my transactions? (reply to 51350)

/B4ckSl4sh\: TON itself does not know anything about how suspicious your transaction is. Tonapi/Tonviewer somehow determines, does it look suspicious or not (reply to 51352)

Anton: @braglop the working language in this chat is English and the chat is moderated strictly to make it a useful place for all devs of any origin, so I removed your discussion in Russian.   To answer some of your concerns: - there are production contracts written in Tact, for instance GasPump. The language is growing in terms of adoption: a lot of contracts on verifier.ton.org are implemented in Tact; - you can check the WIP Jetton implementation written in Tact here: https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton. It is WIP because we want to implement a few features based on modern TVM instructions. We are using this contract as a benchmark to improve gas consumption of Tact contracts, some of those are already implemented and will be released in Tact 1.6, you can check the results in the table here: https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton/wiki#gas-benchmark-results - TON Studio is building many useful Tact contract templates, like Jettons, NFTs, simple DEXes, for devs to make it easier to build on TON with Tact

Mikael: Hello!  I try to calculate jetton wallet address of the smart contract inside it  And do it using   struct JettonWalletData {     status: Int as uint4;     balance: Int as coins;     ownerAddress: Address;     jettonMasterAddress: Address; }  // And the function to calculate the wallet address may look like this: fun calculateJettonWalletAddress(     ownerAddress: Address,     jettonMasterAddress: Address,     jettonWalletCode: Cell ): Address {      let initData = JettonWalletData{         status: 0,         balance: 0,         ownerAddress,         jettonMasterAddress,     };      return contractAddress(StateInit{         code: jettonWalletCode,         data: initData.toCell(),     }); }  I took Cell from explorer, which i received using get_jetton_data, but when i passed it to  ``` jettonWalletCode: Cell = "CODE_FROM_EXPLORER" ``` I received error   How to convert data from exlorer to Cell inside Tact?

/B4ckSl4sh\: I don't understand what you are trying to do (reply to 51559)

SweetJesus: He wants to take jetton wallet's code boc in hex from explorer and convert it to cell inside the contract. (if I got it right) (reply to 51568)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Hmmmm, not a usual task actually) But I think this can done like asm fun getCell() {B{*your boc*} B > boc PUSHREF}

Семен: If you want to calculate Tact contract address via init code + init data you need to add system cell to init parameters  afaik tact implicitly add additional parameters to init data (contract constructor)  Recently I came across with it and solved like this (link) In short init data will be something similar to this:  let init = beginCell() // Implicit Tact init data .storeRef(SYSTEM_CELL) .storeUint(0, 1) // Jetton wallet init data .storeAddress(master) .storeAddress(owner) .endCell()   I didn’t find in docs recommended way to solve similar issues. Maybe it bad practice (reply to 51559)

Vincent: hihi how to handle the message of a bounced message: eg:     bounced(msg: bounced<SomMessage>) { msg.count = 0; }  I just want to set this data but I cannot do it due to compile error. Anyone can give me a hand?

/B4ckSl4sh\: Why do you want to modify data from incoming message? (reply to 51614)

Vincent: I have two smart contract A and B, the external user send a message to A, A then forward the message to B, then B bounced the message to A, In the smart contract A , I want to return the ton to this external user. If I use sender(), I don't think it will be right becasuse the sender() is now B. So I want to decode from incoming bounced message from B and get the address of this external user. (reply to 51615)

Vincent: In this case, handling the bounced message from B, I don't know whom to refund to.

/B4ckSl4sh\: It is impossible, as bounced message contain only 255 bits of original message (address occupy 267) (reply to 51616)

Ivan: Hi everyone! I'm encountering an issue with the Tact Language in VSCode.  Getting multiple "Request textDocument/definition failed" errors with the message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'body')".  Has anyone faced this before or knows how to resolve it?

j: help me, how can i call smart contract in web?

Adam: use ton sdk

Adam: or use get methods with any api

Adam: depends what you mean by call

Adam: if a call that need gas than use sdk

Adam: if doesnt need gas use liteserver with the get method

/B4ckSl4sh\: transactions also may be sent using http api (toncenter/tonapi, etc) (reply to 52318)

Adam: yeah you just need to sign it (reply to 52322)

油饼: Is there an example of a Tact contract code that interacts with USDT? I don't know how to import the USDT contract code for verification. (reply to 52010)

Adam: get method to the jetton master (reply to 52327)

油饼: thank you very much, What I mean is, when deploying the contract, how can I obtain the USDT code, which is the code cell, to use as a parameter for stateInit? The USDT code is written in FunC language. (reply to 52328)

Adam: You wan to calculate the jetton wallet inside the func ?

Adam: Here is it for usdt

油饼: Do I need to first compile the USDT contract code into BOC and then import it?

Adam: You can pass it in the transaction you are making (reply to 52330)

Adam: In the message

Adam: Make a cell and load it inside than pass it to the contract with the call message

Adam: But here is the jetton wallet code if you need it

Adam: b5ee9c72010101010023000842028f452d7a4dfd74066b682365177259ed05734435be76b5fd4bd5d8af2b7c3d68

Adam: This the one for usdt (reply to 52339)

Adam: num: 0x5148e3baabcb0  num: -0x1  cell: b5ee9c72010101010024000043800c881fc78d28207072c728a2e7896228f37e17369ae121cb0eef7b4b0385f33310  cell: b5ee9c7201010701007d00010300c00102012002030143bff872ebdb514d9c97c283b7f0ae5179029e2b6119c39462719e4f46ed8f7413e640040143bff7407e978f01a40711411b1acb773a96bdd93fa83bb5ca8435013c8c4b3ac91f400601020005003e68747470733a2f2f7465746865722e746f2f757364742d746f6e2e6a736f6e00040036  It will return this the last cell is the jetton code

Adam: b5ee9c72010101010023000842028f452d7a4dfd74066b682365177259ed05734435be76b5fd4bd5d8af2b7c3d68 for usdt this is the jetton code just load it and pass it to that fucntion (reply to 52341)

油饼: i'm a new noob, how to send the message to usdt master contract through tonhub or other ways? (reply to 52347)

Adam: What message ??

Adam: If you want to check it in web

Adam: Just go in tonviewer to section web

Adam: If you want to do it with js

油饼: thank you, i got it (reply to 52354)

Adam: if you want to get the cell than you can with java script

油饼: which method should i use? (reply to 52357)

Adam: fromHex

Adam: wallet code is

Adam: const UsdtWalletCode = cell.fromHex("b5ee9c72010101010023000842028f452d7a4dfd74066b682365177259ed05734435be76b5fd4bd5d8af2b7c3d68");

Илья: Hi all. How can I return the remainder of the contract call, I tried via a separate send call, but as I realized everything goes away the first time this method is called  receive(msg: SendTokens) {         require(!self.stopped, "Contract was stopped");         require(now() - msg.timestamp <= 120, "Request expired");          let msgHash: Int = self.getMessageHash(msg.timestamp, msg.amount);          let isValid: Bool = checkSignature(msgHash, msg.signature, self.publicKey);         require(isValid, "Invalid signature!");          self.queryId += 1;          send(SendParameters{             to: self.myJettonWalletAddress,              value: 0,             mode: SendIgnoreErrors,             body: JettonTransfer {                 queryId: self.queryId,                 amount: msg.amount,                 destination: sender(),                 responseDestination: sender(),                 customPayload: null,                 forwardTonAmount: 1,                 forwardPayload: rawSlice("F")             }.toCell(),         });          send(SendParameters{             to: sender(),             value: 0,             mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendRemainingValue,             body: Excesses{}.toCell(),         });     }

Anton: might be the issue described here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/send/#outbound-message-processing (reply to 52369)

Adam: can you clarify the issue ? (reply to 52369)

Adam: pretty sure you it doesnt have leave enough gas for second one to  send

Илья: Yeah, it can be

Илья: How does SendPayGasSeparately work? (reply to 52370)

Adam: it will be the msg.amount + gasfee if using this method (reply to 52374)

Илья: Fee of first send

Adam: without it the gas fee will be taken from the amount itself (reply to 52375)

Илья: O (reply to 52378)

Илья: I just have a question: how do I accurately calculate what amount of ton to send to issue tokens and what amount to return (in bounce message)?

Adam: normally even without that the normal token contract after issuing tokens it will send the remaining (reply to 52380)

Adam: responseDestination: sender()

Adam: the remaining will be sent here (reply to 52382)

Илья: it's just that the tonkeeper doesn't indicate that I got anything back.

Adam: send the tx if you can

Adam: ill check it

Илья: иthat's why I didn't realize what was going on

Илья: https://tonviewer.com/transaction/1090935419031c601f95b3deda2f229f8687f879777747dde950d18ca9019c8d?utm_source=tonkeeper

油饼: hello, can help me to solve this problem?

Byebye: Hello, how i can send bulk/multiple transaction ?

Anton: The address field does not fit into the 224 bit limits for bounced messages, because addresses take up 267 bits (reply to 52448)

油饼: How can I solve this problem? For example, a user sends a message to Contract 1, Contract 1 sends a message to Contract 2, Contract 2 bounces the message back to Contract 1, and then Contract 1 returns the amount to the user. (reply to 52452)

油饼: Do I need to temporarily store the user address in the Contract1? (reply to 52453)

Adam: You can manage that with op code (reply to 52453)

Adam: The contract 1 needs to open the body of the bounced message

Adam: Check it’s a bounce

Adam: Oh I see where is the problem we dont have the address of the sender

油饼: My current approach is to temporarily store the user address in a map within Contract 1, and then retrieve and delete it after the bounce. I'm not sure if this approach is reasonable. (reply to 52458)

Adam: It will the up the fees alot (reply to 52459)

Adam: Because it will storage fee with tx too

油饼: Could you give me some reasonable suggestions? (reply to 52461)

User: Is that possible to avoid bounce in your contract 2 and just send it back to user address? (reply to 52453)

User: Why it can be bounced?

Adam: I dont think contract 2 it’s his contract (reply to 52463)

Adam: If it was his contract he can just manage it there

Adam: Is contract 2 yours too?? (reply to 52462)

油饼: yes ,it's mine.  Contract 1 is the main contract that records total data, similar to the main contract of a jetton. Contract 2 is a user-specific contract used to record the user's exclusive data, like a sub-contract of a jetton. The user sends a staking message to Contract 1, which deploys Contract 2 for the user and confirms whether the user has already staked. If the user has already staked, it does not allow the user to stake again and refunds the amount. (reply to 52467)

Adam: That simplifies things alot (reply to 52468)

油饼: I understand now. It's reasonable and practical to use Contract 2 to refund the amount to the user, right? I hadn't thought of that. Thank you very much for your suggestion. (reply to 52469)

Adam: contract MyContract {     bounced(msg: bounced<MyMessage>) {         // ...     } } (reply to 52468)

Adam: use this on contract 1 this allows you to process bounced message that was sent form contract 1

Adam: and get the adrress from the message

Adam: so instead of storing the address in the contract storage store it in the message and if bounced process the bounced message and send it back to user

油饼: can't bounce address in bounced message (reply to 52452)

油饼: the address size is too big

Adam: I see than send the message to contract 2 and make it non bounceable

Adam: then proccess the error on contract 2

油饼: Yes, I understand now. Thank you for your suggestion. (reply to 52482)

Adam: You welcome any time

Adam: nice (reply to 52487)

BAKU: make a joke that for my business I have a store and I want to make gifts for my workers, the logic is that my contract can create a coin, a random amount, and when a person connects his wallet, he should have a contract call written and not just send, the logic of the contract is already written and everything works, you send him an amount and it gives a random amount of coins, but still I can't call it, the button is on the site where my workers will go (reply to 52613)

djan: Friends, can you help me? I have Contract 1, where users can stake a certain amount each round. Contract 1 continuously generates revenue and periodically calculates dividends based on the proportion of the players' staked amounts, then enters a new round. To address the issue of unlimited user growth, I designed Contract 2 for each user, but I don't know how to solve the problem of infinite growth of dividend historical data. Can you give me some reasonable suggestions?

Adam: Using ft (reply to 52707)

Adam: fingible tokens will allow you to store nothing but still kmow who staked and how much they stake

djan: What I mean is that I want users to actively claim their earnings, but the amount they can claim is determined by their staked amount and the earnings, which are dynamic. I don't know how to store the earnings data for each round. (reply to 52709)

djan: I originally wanted to design a Contract 3 for the earnings, but since the earnings are calculated, users cannot determine the address of Contract 3 when they claim their earnings. (reply to 52710)

Adam: you can store it in interanal storage of contract but I dont recomment that (reply to 52710)

Adam: the best way is when a person stake either genrate a proof of stake and store it somewhere in your local data

Adam: or for each stake for exemple let's say they staked 50000 token issue for them 50,000 staked-token like how lp work

Adam: like that there is nothing to store uk how mucch they staked just by how much staked-token they own

djan: Okay, thank you very much. I'll first understand how this mechanism works. (reply to 52715)

djan: Is there any open-source code for liquidity staking mining on the TON blockchain that I can study? (reply to 52715)

Adam: I don't think so (reply to 52718)

Adam: you can check in dedust they their contracts

Adam: I am working on one anyways I ll make it open source as soon as I finish it it will solve the storage issue (reply to 52718)

Adam: 🚀 Staking Made Scalable! 🪙  Hey everyone! 👋  Here’s a small idea for a staking contract using the Jetton principle it took me some time to apply . Here are the keyfeatures:  Scalability: Each Jetton wallet tracks its own staking data, solving the problem of storing infinite dividend history. 📊 How it works: 1️⃣ Stake TON → Master contract mints staked Jettons and keep the staked ton. 2️⃣ Withdraw → Burn Jettons, get TON back and get data from your jetton wallet to calculate reward .  Simple, efficient, and perfect for scaling! Let me know your thoughts!  Check my git so you can read the contract:   https://github.com/Vodka2134156/staked-TON/   Thanks for motivations  Note :In my contract I stored just date of staking you can store more data of staking and the contract is detected as token so people will be more familiar with it (reply to 52718)

Adam: Note: this is not liquid staking this time lock staking , staked ton or token can t be moved through wallet, this is just a solution for pool staking contracts needing alot of storage (reply to 52732)

Adam: can be turned into pool staking you need to remove the restriction in the contract and not record the time on the contract (reply to 52735)

djan: Thank you very much for providing the source code for me to study. I will carefully read through the project's code and master the relevant knowledge of TON smart contract development. (reply to 52736)

Adam: You welcome, sharing is what help chain grow I used this logic on some staking project (reply to 52738)

Adam: the difference is just no stocking data in one main contract but stocking in small contract in case here the jetton wallet contract

Adam: which make it infinitely scalable as the data is decentralised hahaha, we are on blockchain so think decentralized

Adam: that's how tokens can store ifinite amount of holders

Adam: like that you can store infinite amount of stakers token act like a proof of stake in there

djan: Yes, I am slowly grasping the core ideas of the architecture. I need to carefully read the code you provided to gain a deeper understanding of some important development details, such as security issues. Once again, I appreciate your enthusiastic help. (reply to 52744)

Adam: Yeah, no worries. (reply to 52745)

Adam: There are some imperfections as I coded in only 3 hours. If you don’t understand some points just write me a message here (reply to 52745)

Adam: Just follow in you json the format that get gems support (reply to 52866)

djan: hello, how to build the mint  message in tact ?

Adam: Sure give me a second (reply to 52908)

Adam: message Mint {     amount: Int;     receiver: Address; } receive(msg: Mint) {         let ctx: Context = context();         require(ctx.sender == self.owner, "Not Owner");         require(self.mintable, "Can't Mint Anymore");         self.mint(msg.receiver, msg.amount, self.owner); // (to, amount, response_destination)     } fun mint(to: Address, amount: Int, response_destination: Address) {         require(self.totalSupply + amount <= self.max_supply, "The total supply will be overlapping.");         self.totalSupply = self.totalSupply + amount; // Update total supply          let winit: StateInit = self.getJettonWalletInit(to); // Create message         send(SendParameters{             to: contractAddress(winit),              value: 0,              bounce: false,             mode: SendRemainingValue,             body: TokenTransferInternal{                  queryId: 0,                 amount: amount,                 from: myAddress(),                 response_destination: response_destination,                 forward_ton_amount: 0,                 forward_payload: emptySlice()             }.toCell(),             code: winit.code,             data: winit.data         });     }

Adam: and define Token Transfer internal Like this

Adam: message(0x178d4519) TokenTransferInternal {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     from: Address;     response_destination: Address;     forward_ton_amount: Int as coins;     forward_payload: Slice as remaining; // Comment Text message when Transfer the jetton }

Adam: this is how to build a mint in the jetton master contract , if you want just a mint message to send to another master contract than just follow the same structure to build the message cell in tact

djan: this message i defined is right? (reply to 52908)

Adam: master message is not needed (reply to 52915)

Adam: minting doesn't need more infors then to address and amount to mint

djan: if no master mesage, the total_supply will be right? (reply to 52917)

djan: I am sending a mint message to another already deployed Jetton contract (written in func).

Adam: In that case you need the master message (reply to 52919)

Adam: store the master msg as a refferencein the main boy

djan: Is it correct to define the Tact structure like this according to the code in the screenshot of Func? (reply to 52915)

Adam: Let MasterMessage:cell =  beginCell()     .storeUnint(randomOp,32))     .storeUnint(Id)     .storeCoins(AmountToMint)     .endCell(); let MintMessage:cell  = beginCell()     .storeUnint(Opcode,32))     .storeAddress(ToAddress)     .storeRef(MasterMessage)     .endCell(); (reply to 52922)

Adam: define master messgae

djan: Okay, I understand. Thank you very much for your help.

Adam: the message above is what you need to send (reply to 52926)

Adam: But the contract needs to be the owner of the jetton (reply to 52926)

djan: Why doesn't the Mint message you constructed here have an amount field? Isn't the mint_tokens function supposed to take the amount parameter? Also, I don't quite understand why the amount and jett_amount variables are separated in the Func code. Aren't they the same?

Adam: this amount is not used for anything and you cant add the amount in the message dirrectly because you must follow what that master contract accepts (reply to 52929)

Adam: It's a smart contract already deployed so you have no choice other then to follow the message structure they are using

djan: okay, thank you (reply to 52932)

Adam: the problem is that if you send amount as parmeter token will be sent to you

Adam: but the total supply will not be updated

Adam: so both you need master message too

djan: Okay, I understand now. I didn't quite grasp the significance of this design before. Perhaps this design offers more flexibility in certain scenarios.

djan: thank you very much

Adam: yeah master message updates the total supply (reply to 52937)

Adam: and the mint message amount is sent back to user

djan: okay

Nerses: How TACT file and contract name can be renamed so it will compiles later ? as just simple renaming causes error "could not determine executable to run"

Anton: It’s not entirely clear what you are asking. How do you run Tact? Do you use Blueprint, tact-template, something else? (reply to 53115)

Nerses: I use blueprint. I used to compile contracts with command npx blueprint build. Is there anything I can describe better so the problem will be clear ? (reply to 53116)

Александр: Maybe problem with .compile file located in wrappers. Make sure that targets include new contracts file name (reply to 53115)

Cyril M |: hi guys, I wanna know if there's a cheaper way to airdrop jetton? right now the estimates shows 7 TON per 100 address. we have like 109,000 address to airdrop and it would cost around 7.6k TON

Cyril M |: how did $Dogs able to airdrop to 2.5m address

Cyril M |: ithat'

Cyril M |: that's 1,750,000,000 TON

Johnny Le: https://t.me/tondev_news/152 (reply to 53142)

Johnny Le: try this

Cyril M |: or $8,750,000,000

Johnny Le: its  Mintless Jettons

Johnny Le: https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/mintless-jettons#retrieving-airdrop-information

grachzy: Hi all, how can I implement in tact to analyze a transaction by asset type (nft, jetton and other crypto assets)? For example, I have a wallet contract called from the main contract, which receives assets from 2 users, the contract analyzes these assets, if they correspond to the declared ones, then the exchange between the users takes place.

Aniruddh: I have experience with Tact and can help fix and refine your smart contract. Let’s discuss the issues and possible improvements. I’m available for consultation and any necessary adjustments. Looking forward to working on this! (reply to 53183)

Adam: You want to make an exchange between two users right ??? (reply to 53195)

Adam: You can either maka contract that do that and deploy it the contract will like a box when bothe users give it the adviced amounts it send the items

Adam: Like a third person who assist the exchange

Adam: Or can be done programtically using the api and checking the later txs

Adam: But the contract approach is safer

Равиль: Hi. Help please. I am sending a usdt token to the contract address, but the smart contract is not included in the TokenNotification function.

Fire: Ensure your contract implements ITokenReceiver, correctly processes Jetton transfer messages with op code 0x7362d09c, includes a valid payload, has enough TON for gas fees, and debug using TON Explorer or CLI tools. (reply to 53407)

Павел: Hello everyone!  I recently read this post https://t.me/nextmayor/655  I found myself in points 1 and 3 (especially about the shit)  And this motivated me to verify smart contracts.

Mikael: Error: Malformed response:  Why this error cause during script exectuion? I made npx blueprint run command and selected necessary script and mainnet as a chain

Nerses: I am doing jetton transfer to smart contract and based on jetton notify message forward_payload the contract does some action. After successful transfer in contract accumulates some amount of funds, and I can find out where it comes from. Could someone give a hint what can cause this ?

Nerses: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/ced543d271a033581b7e969d6ef2e17f1e27c7b09b086c186f1cb18cae4f7741

Nerses: after this tx in contract accumulated 0.078060727 ton

Adam: What causes what?? (reply to 53505)

NEO: hello I have a problem  How can I communicate with jetton master from jetton wallet when a transfer is happening?

Nerses: what causes accumulating  fonds in contract (reply to 53510)

Adam: The forward amount received each jetton transfer has a forward amount and in your case it accumulates on contract and that’s a good thing (reply to 53513)

Adam: Because the smart contract will need to perform some actions so it needs gas too

Adam: With a message?? (reply to 53512)

NEO: yeah but token transfer is a message itself so I need to keep track of its properties like amount and etc but how? (reply to 53516)

Adam: No when jetton wallet receive the message (reply to 53517)

Adam: It will issue two messages one of them to the master contract

Bekzod Muminov: Okay (reply to 53519)

NEO: this is what it looks like (reply to 53519)

Adam: If anyone need a smart contract dev on TON contact me :)

Nerses: How do decentralized exchanges (DEXs) handle fund swaps when a transaction fails? Specifically, if a user sends jettons to initiate a swap, and the swap is processed based on the payload data in the jetton notify message, what mechanisms are in place to ensure that the user's funds are refunded in case the transaction fails after receiving the jettons?

Nerses: Can I obtain jetton wallet address on chain in smart contract in case I receive jetton master address as input message ?

Adam: Yess (reply to 53526)

Adam: Can be caculated using jetton address code and wallet address

Nerses: is it the only approach ? (reply to 53528)

Nerses: as for every jetton to store its code it will be not effective

Ivan: Hey everyone! I saw the "Work in Progress – DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION YET" notice on /tact-lang/jetton.  Could you briefly explain the advantages of this particular implementation? Also, how does it compare to other implementations—are there any caveats or issues with them in contrast to this official one?  And is there a production-ready Jetton implementation in Tact that you’d recommend?

Anton: it’s actually almost ready: we would like to introduce some modern gas-related features there but the baseline is good already (although there was no external security auditing so far) (reply to 53575)

Anton: @B4ckSl4sh might probably add some more on the immediate plans

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yeah, audit has not been conducted yet, but according to our internal tests - it should work as expected. After Tact 1.6 release  this implementation will be even closer to reference implementation (reply to 53575)

Vladimir: Ok, sorry for bother you. I'll investigate this issue later

/B4ckSl4sh\: That is the way how tonkeeper calculates "fee". In most cases it means amount of tons you sent minus amount of tons you received (reply to 53601)

Denis: Today I sent the solution to the task for the TON contest. Guys, thanks for the tact-lang, it made my life really better, because func need more time to learn.  Your docs are really helpful, thank you for your work 🙂  Ofc there were a lot of surprises, I don't remember all of them, but for example, there was a bit challenge to parse Merkle Proof cell, because contract just rises exit code 9 and thats all 😄 God bless TVM whitepaper  and your func/asm code import.

ABCDE: Hello everyone!  I need to store a group of numbers, and it can potentially be very large. Numbers are added via a message from another contract. At a certain point, I need to recalculate these numbers in a loop.  What's the best way to store them? Currently, I'm using a map, but when the number of elements exceeds 300-400, I hit the gas limit. Could serialization be a solution? Or should I manually pack them into storage slots? How can I make this as gas-efficient as possible?

ABCDE: Sure, I create a separate smart contract for each user, and I store these numbers in the user's smart contract. But it takes too much gas to save these numbers in a map, and even more gas to recalculate them. (reply to 53628)

ABCDE: Thank you for your response. I replied above. (reply to 53669)

Adam: Why save them in a map if each user save his ? (reply to 53763)

Adam: The whole purpose of each persopn saving his is to not have a map

Nxrix: can a contract store a string and how long can it be?

Anton: A contract cannot have more than 65536 different cells and one cell can only contain at most 127 ASCII characters. But you will be most likely limited by 0.4 TON gas limit. Also, it’s usually not a good idea to do string manipulations in smart contracts: it is expensive and should be done at the backend side of your dapp, for instance (reply to 53767)

Traffic Builder: When I built the TACT code, I generated this kind of code for the method. Should I call the contract using this approach?

Adam: Hi

Adam: can someone fix the docs for accepting nfts in tact it's set wrong?

Adam: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/nfts/#accepting-nft-ownership-assignment

Adam: this part is wrong

Adam: you are a responsibe please correct the docs , the message struct is wrong here will get people into 136 exit code (reply to 46113)

Jiego: you can always send a PR https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/cookbook/nfts.mdx (reply to 53879)

Adam: Thanks I suggested the improvement there

Adam: Here is the PR :https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/1747

Adam: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard is this too editable ?

Adam: it's missing some important message for dedust to work so it will most likely fail in dedust

Я̨kov: Not sure, that website is slowly getting out of date. Moreover, the Jetton implementation given there was a quick hack pulled together by some members of the community and is NOT intended for production use.  At this point, it is only good for presenting many features of Tact at once, i.e. for learning :)   In coming months, we plan on introducing a refurbished version of it, which could feature the proper Tact implementation of the Jetton (currently WIP) (reply to 53901)

Adam: Yeah just saw that thanks again . (reply to 53903)

Adam: Hey guys if anyone needs a dev for smart contracts on TON contact me.😇

Adam: Can you send tx or hash

Adam: Error message are shown just in debugging

Adam: Not in tvm execution

Adam: You can check the tvm steps

Adam: If it fails at a throwif you can check which throwif it failed on

Я̨kov: Unfortunately, transaction can only show you the exit code as a number, not as a string.  That said, see: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-debug/#require  And https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#report (reply to 53909)

Я̨kov: Yes, with throw(yourExitCode) or other functions here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-debug (reply to 53919)

Adam: It’s not a tact issue (reply to 53922)

Adam: It’s tvm that doesn’t support it

Seva: Are there any examples of binary search or segment tree implementation. Is it possible?

Я̨kov: For one, GasPump's TypeScript wrappers for contracts were obtained with Tact.  About wrappers Tact produces, in general: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#wrap (reply to 53944)

Я̨kov: I'm not sure of the purpose, but if you're ok with bigger gas use, you can represent maps as arrays and then do, say, binary search.  https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/data-structures/#array (reply to 53945)

Good: Hello, guys. How can I extract public_key as Int from received message to checkDataSignature? Also, is there easy way to make corresponding signature from message payload on ts-client side?

Anton: message Foo {     publicKey: Int as uint256;     … }

Ilia: Or: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/18105/how-does-recovering-the-public-key-from-an-ecdsa-signature-work (reply to 54004)

Ilia: In short - there is a way to recover knowing signature and message hash

Adam: An external or internal message ? (reply to 54004)

Adam: Received message doesnt have by default the pubkey

Adam: Only the adress and value

Adam: You need either to pass it each time in the message itself as Int

Adam: Or do like wallet contract does (save the pubkey in the wallet storage in deployement)

— 2025-02-10 —

Adam: What? You interact with it with the op codes you chose

Ivan: /tact-lang/tact-language-server Thanks for the TACT Extension! Why didn't you announce it? =) 👍

Anton: we are testing it internally now, it still has some rough edges, for instance, it does not have a formatter and it does not report compiler errors yet (reply to 54129)

Anton: we will properly announce it when the plugin gets integrated with the compiler

Anton: thanks for your feedback :)

Anton: if you have some ideas how to improve it or found a bug, please feel free to open an issue here https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/issues

Я̨kov: However, if you don't have any issues, please leave a positive review so that the plugin becomes more popular in the future ❤️ (reply to 54133)

Anton: hopefully you will like some nice inlay hints, like on the picture

Anton: it tells you the parameter names and also, in this case, the exit code which corresponds to the message string

Ivan: so handy, thanks! (reply to 54135)

Ivan: and finally I can jump wherever I want in a click))

Adam: this is a multisig contract (reply to 54135)

Adam: ?

Anton: yep, this one: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/examples/multisig-3.tact (reply to 54141)

Adam: eyy bad timing just opened a bounty in git about making a multisig contracts , wallet standards ,and nft standards in tact to add to tact-by-exemples hahah I guess bad timing of mine

Adam: ?

Дмитрий: I wanted to inform you that this repository contains an incorrect contract.deploy.ts file. Please, check this  https://github.com/tact-lang/contract-wallet (reply to 54145)

Adam: Can you prcise exaclty what you think is wrong?

Adam: Yeah you are right the initilising of the contract is done wrongly

Adam: You need to initilise the contract with publickey and wallet Id

Adam: the contract is porbably outdated since it was from 2023 and still not solved

Дмитрий: And this repository is closed or it’s deleted  https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact?tab=readme-ov-file#-smart-contracts-examples

Anton: thanks for letting us know

Adam: the repo is outdated with an old wallet contract and wrong initilisings (reply to 54165)

Дмитрий: Maybe you should update repositories that was uploaded 2 years ago and earlier

Adam: to be honest even the actual token standars available on tact is lacking some fundamantals and would be gas heavy and fail on dexes so no point of undating launchpad not alteast token contract is updated (reply to 54164)

Adam: I can do that if it can be added to the exemples? (reply to 54167)

Adam: I would appreciate that actually

Дмитрий: I have work jetton example. It can be listed on DEX (reply to 54168)

Adam: yeah it needed just to opcode provide jetton wallet and another one i dont remember but it's still gas heave tact still need gas optimisation and move on from func building (reply to 54171)

Adam: if you check the build folder and read the func you will fimd out that it's so heavy

Adam: But for now it's all good as tact is improving quite fast

Дмитрий: Can you give me some ideas to example contracts? I want to practice

Adam: Try to make an escrow on tact (reply to 54175)

Adam: for nfts

Adam: I am always down to write contract for comunity to learn

Adam: I am already working on ton-dns impelementation in tact I dont knwo if it's possible to dd them later to the tact exemple , tact-by-exemple contarct are outdated and people needs exemple to learn tact

Adam: If you can guys suggest contract that you want to see as exemple to learn from them I can make them

Дмитрий: Can you talk about it more? (reply to 54176)

Дмитрий: What is escrow?

Adam: For exemple you want to sell me an nft , make a contract that will hold that nft and the person can buy that nft from it for a certain price (reply to 54181)

Adam: you deploy the contract and send the nft to it

Adam: the contract will act like a middle man between seller and buyers

Дмитрий: NFT sale contract?

Дмитрий: I’ve seen ready-made examples somewhere

Adam: Yes in func it is avaialble

Adam: but I dont think in tact

Adam: getgems nft contract

Adam: implement this on tact

Adam: for wallet contarct exemple you think I should adapt which wallet version and revision? (reply to 54186)

Adam: can I get your opinion to Anton , for DNS-ton too? (reply to 54165)

Дмитрий: I think w4r2 is good (reply to 54192)

Дмитрий: Or last

Adam: I just don't want to interact with something if they are already working on it

Дмитрий: I use this version (reply to 54194)

Adam: yeah v4 second revision (reply to 54197)

Adam: It has alot of pluggins that I don't know if they are doable with tact

Adam: You mean the v5? (reply to 54195)

Дмитрий: Yeah (reply to 54200)

Adam: first I will start with correcting this a repo (reply to 54159)

Adam: and if they agree I can try to make the basic func contract available in productuion into TON

Adam: because they require more work

Vlad: Does anyone have a link to minter contract only on tact? https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter

Adam: Minter contract is not complete on tact I advice to use the func version for the moment (reply to 54205)

Adam: https://github.com/Vodka2134156/wallet (reply to 54194)

Adam: here is a deployable version

Adam: where you can initialise and deploy just corrected the deployement and initialising part

Дмитрий: Good

Дмитрий: I am working on nft sale contract now. Maybe it will be ready tomorrow

Adam: That's good too

Adam: ? (reply to 54221)

Bohdan: hi guys, do your contracts deploy fine on testnet? Because I have some weird error: [TON_CONNECT_SDK] Wallet message received: {   error: { code: 0, message: 'java.lang.NullPointerException' },   id: 16 }

⚡Mohammed: hello every one

⚡Mohammed: I'm working on an application that supports payments via TON Connect SDK, where users can pay for their subscription fees using USDT Jettons through Tonkeeper. The goal is to successfully transfer USDT Jettons from the user's wallet to the bot's wallet, ensuring that the invoice is displayed correctly in Tonkeeper, and the bot receives the payment.

⚡Mohammed: Issues We Have Encountered So Far 1️⃣ Issue 1: "Invalid amount: 0" Error When executing handleTonPayment, we receive the following error:  yaml Copy Edit ❌ Payment failed: [TON_CONNECT_SDK_ERROR] UnknownError Invalid amount: 0 ✅ Solutions We Tried:  Ensured that amountInNanoJettons is correctly calculated (5 USDT = 5000000 nanoJettons). Logged values in the console, and they appear correct: yaml Copy Edit 🔹 USDT Amount: 5 🔹 Amount in NanoJettons: 5000000n Set amount: "0" inside transaction, as the amount is included in payloadBase64, but the error still persists.

⚡Mohammed: 2️⃣ Issue 2: Tonkeeper Displays Invoice with 0 USDT When I set a valid value for amount inside transaction, Tonkeeper opens the invoice successfully. However, the invoice displays 0 USDT instead of the correct amount. When clicking "Confirm Payment", no amount is deducted from the wallet except for network fees, meaning that the actual value is not included in the transaction. ✅ Solutions We Tried:  Passing amount: "0" → Received the error Invalid amount: 0. Removing amount from transaction completely → Received the error No value for amount. Passing amount: amountInNanoJettons.toString() → But Tonkeeper still does not display the correct amount in the invoice. Ensured that payloadBase64 contains the correct amount → But Tonkeeper still displays 0 USDT.

⚡Mohammed: Code Handling the Payment 🔹 createJettonTransferPayload Function to Generate the Payload ts Copy Edit export const createJettonTransferPayload = (recipientAddress: string, amount: bigint) => {     if (!recipientAddress) {         throw new Error("❌ recipientAddress is missing or invalid");     }      console.log(✅ Creating Jetton Transfer Payload for recipient: ${recipientAddress});      return beginCell()         .storeUint(0xf8a7ea5, 32) // ✅ Jetton transfer OP Code         .storeUint(0, 64) // ✅ Query ID         .storeCoins(amount) // ✅ Amount in nanoJettons         .storeAddress(Address.parseRaw(recipientAddress)) // ✅ Recipient address         .storeAddress(null) // ✅ Forward TON address - Not used         .storeCoins(0) // ✅ Forward amount - Not used         .endCell()         .toBoc()         .toString("base64"); // ✅ Convert Payload to Base64 };

⚡Mohammed: Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 🙏🚀

Adam: beginCell()           .storeUint(0xf8a7ea5, 32)           .storeUint(0, 64)           .storeCoins(toNano(amount))           .storeAddress(Address.parse(recipientAddress))           .storeAddress(Address.parse(recipientAddress))           .storeBit(0)           .storeCoins(1)           .storeBit(0)           .endCell()            .toBoc()            .toString("base64"); (reply to 54235)

Adam: this the right payload to use

Nikita: Who knows how to retrieve all NFTs that are on a smart contract? The smart contract itself ensures that the NFTs it holds are available on the Marketplace. How can I extract these NFTs so they are displayed on the Marketplace?

Adam: Inside the smart contract ? (reply to 54243)

Adam: or off-chain

Nikita: . (reply to 54245)

Nikita: Well, the NFTs are on the contract, so how can I add them to the marketplace on my client? How can I get a list of all NFTs for sale? (reply to 54244)

— 2025-02-11 —

Adam: Yeah you can just call an api on ton api (reply to 54247)

Nikita: And will it return all NFTs even if there are 1000 of them? I don’t understand (reply to 54248)

Adam: See this will return even if there is 1000 item

Nikita: It’s free? (reply to 54261)

Nikita: This is also used on professional NFT marketplaces? (reply to 54261)

Adam: Yes and yes

know: What exactly are USDT Jettons? Is it a way to make smaller denominations of USDT or something more specific? (reply to 54232)

Pedro: That's not the right way to encode to base64 with ton keeper (reply to 54235)

Nikita: What if everything is on different contracts? So each NFT for sale is on a separate contract? (reply to 54248)

Pedro: I can't understand why somebody would use http api to query contracts..

Pedro: Is the contract closed-source?

Pedro: Anyway, through that api endpoint you won't  get all nft for sale, only nfts of a specific account

Nikita: How do? (reply to 54277)

Pedro: you should look for the right endpoint that returns all listings, https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/rest-api/nft (reply to 54284)

P: Why this error occurs if I use @ton/ton at in frontend?

Adam: Define buffer in you config (reply to 54292)

Adam: because google or whatever navigator you have doesnt suppot buffers

B.: Thank you, so much (reply to 54343)

Good: Ok. Thank you. It works for Ed25519. But it's weird  ecrecover is implemented in tact and I didn't find legal methods in ton's sdks in order to get {r,s,v} from payload and keys. Just {r,s} (reply to 54006)

Adam: what do you need the ed25519 signature verification for (reply to 54380)

Adam: the contract can just store his pubkey at deplyement

Adam: so you dont pass it each time

Good: check the integrity of the payload when sending through an intermediary contract and verify that it belongs to the sender

Good: Ed25519 doesn't allow to check the last, and I just compare ctx.sender with some msg field

Adam: Just sign the message (reply to 54385)

Adam: At last publickkey and signature

Adam: It will be like that

Good: done 2 days ago (reply to 54387)

Adam: .storeref(signedMessag) .store_slice(sig) .storeInt(pubkey)

Adam: This is the message that you can send

Adam: The contract will check signatures with pubkey and signed message

Adam: And then perform actions on signed message

Adam: And you can get ctx.sender from pubkey to compare (reply to 54393)

Good: that's ok. I've managed that recently. Above it's just my feedback about ton's drawbacks

Edward: Hi, guys. How to add new sender into deploy typescript? I know the owner sender of tact contract is from WALLET_MNEMONIC in .env file, but don't the logic how it create the network provider. Thank you

Good: smth like that await contract.send(         YOUR_SENDER,         {             value: toNano('0.05'),         },         {             $$type: 'Deploy',             queryId: 0n,         }     ); (reply to 54419)

Edward: i need to know how to get the "your_sender", because i already deploy the tact contract, but just have provider.sender() able to call function send, i want another wallet able to call function, Thanks

Good: This is an example how to open wallet contract. And this is example how to use your sender. Hope, tha's enough to combine. Just use your wallet contract instead of sender

Edward: Ok, thanks

Nikita: Who knows how to implement a contract system for a marketplace where each NFT will have its own separate contract, and I will be able to manage it? That is, a person can list their NFT on the marketplace, it will be stored in the contract, they can retrieve it, and perform similar actions. And someone else can buy it. How can I implement this? Do I need to create smart contracts for this, or is it all somehow handled on the backend?

— 2025-02-14 —

WhyesCode: You will need to create individual smart contracts for each NFT to make this work.  That way, users can list their NFTs, have them securely stored in the contract, retrieve them when needed, and others can purchase them...all handled on the blockchain. (reply to 54455)

WhyesCode: Your backend will manage the user interface and interactions, but the core actions like transfers and sales are best managed through these smart contracts for transparency and security.

Adam: Idk 🤷 (reply to 54557)

Adam: Someone sent me this message

Adam: I replied than it disappeared from my dms

Somyaditya: Hi guys, I am working to develop a smart contract that will handle receiving and withdrawing USDT (Jettons)

Somyaditya: Can anyone provide me some reference please, how can i interact with usdt to initiate the transfers and receive the tokens

Somyaditya: I have good experience in Solidity Smart contracts, but trying Tact for the first time

Adam: Just accept the jetton notification message (reply to 54571)

Adam: If you cant i can make you the usdt handling part

Somyaditya: Could you please share me

Somyaditya: Also how can i call usdt contract to make the transfer

Erdan: does https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/wallets-list/main/wallets-v2.json update? 'app_name': 'telegram-wallet', 'bridge_url': 'https://walletbot.me/tonconnect-bridge/bridge' Bridge error -> READY_STATE_CONNECTING

Anton: Try searching the Tact docs, there are some examples in the Cookbook part (reply to 54571)

Nerses: I am working on a DeFi project for swaps where the user is responsible for covering all fees, including storage fees. However, there's a challenge when the user wants to swap Toncoin: determining the exact amount they should send and how to handle any excess while ensuring the contract retains only the required amount.  I tried investigating StonFi and Dedust for insights but couldn’t find anything valuable. Does anyone have experience with this or know of a proper approach?

Nikita: Does anyone know how the Telegram gift-selling system in Tonnel works?

maksim: Based on v5 wallet plugins, soon there will be an example of a similar system implemented in Tact (reply to 54606)

Nikita: Really? (reply to 54607)

Nikita: But they are in Telegram, not on the blockchain. (reply to 54607)

maksim: I mean v5 wallet plugins, not the gift-selling system (reply to 54608)

Nikita: Ok (reply to 54610)

maksim: Integration is made through Fragment (reply to 54609)

Nikita: Really? (reply to 54612)

Nikita: How? (reply to 54612)

bb: hello, someone knows how state variables are displayed in tact?

/B4ckSl4sh\: What do you mean by "displayed"? (reply to 54624)

bb: Sorry, I mean expressed

bb: uint variable keeps giving error

/B4ckSl4sh\: Share a minimal example, please (reply to 54627)

bb: totalSupply: uint256 = 10000000000; // 10,000,000,000 tokens     owner: address;     balances: map(address, uint256);

bb: uint erroe, with or without 256

bb: no?

bb: no help?

/B4ckSl4sh\: You are using incorrect syntax for maps (reply to 54629)

bb: I know but I cannot find right one

bb: state {         totalSupply: uint;                  owner: address;                     balances: map(address, uint);      }  this also wrong

Я̨kov: Maybe you've meant:  struct State {     totalSupply: Int;     owner: Address;                 balances: map<Address, Int>; }  Documentation on maps: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/maps/

Я̨kov: By the way, it seems like you intend to make a large map in a single contract, which goes against the sharding principles and approaches used on TON — to make smaller individual contracts for storing state of the individual user/owner.  For an example of that, see the (WIP!) implementation of Jetton (i.e. Token) in Tact: https://github.com/tact-lang/jetton (reply to 54636)

bb: thank you

bb: I am beginner, maybe too ambitious try...

bb: where do i find a thorough lexicon of FunC language and Tact language?

Adam: You want code in tact or func? (reply to 54642)

Rob: Hi guys. I have a very simple counter contract: import "@stdlib/deploy";  contract Counter with Deployable {     val: Int as uint32;     queryId: Int as uint32;      init(queryNumber: Int) {         self.val = 0;         self.queryId = queryNumber;     }      receive("increment") {         self.val += 1;     }      get fun counter(): Int {         return self.val;     } } My question is that how to send a transaction with increment message to the contract using @tonconnect/ui package in Javascript? I have already written the following code. But it shows me fee calculation error. I think there is a problem with encoding payload: const incrementCounter = async () => {         if (!connectedWallet) return;         try {             const payload = btoa("increment"); // Encode "increment" message in Base64              const transaction = {                 validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60,                 messages: [                     {                         address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,                         amount: "100000000", // Small amount of TON for execution                         payload, // Encoded message                     },                 ],             };              await tonConnectUI?.sendTransaction(transaction);             fetchCounter(); // Refresh counter after transaction         } catch (error) {             console.error("Error sending transaction:", error);         }     };

Pedro: https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/preparing-messages (reply to 54670)

maksim: Hi, can you provide error log? (reply to 54670)

Pedro: Check the docs to see how to encode the increment receiver on the frontend properly with the operation code and pass it to tonconnect as base64 like this: payload: increment.toBoc().toString("base64") (reply to 54670)

/B4ckSl4sh\: I guess you need something like  payload = beginCell().storeUint(0, 32).storeStringTail("increment").endCell() (reply to 54670)

KADDECHE 🐾: Hello

KADDECHE 🐾: I am new here I want to learn I coming from binance airdrop ton !? 😊

Pedro: Behnam (reply to 54678)

Rob: According to the documentation the payload parameter should be of type string: const transaction = {     validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60, // 60 sec     messages: [         {             address: "EQBBJBB3HagsujBqVfqeDUPJ0kXjgTPLWPFFffuNXNiJL0aA",             amount: "20000000",          // stateInit: "base64bocblahblahblah==" // just for instance. Replace with your transaction initState or remove         },         {             address: "EQDmnxDMhId6v1Ofg_h5KR5coWlFG6e86Ro3pc7Tq4CA0-Jn",             amount: "60000000",          // payload: "base64bocblahblahblah==" // just for instance. Replace with your transaction payload or remove         }     ] } (reply to 54677)

Pedro: Check this comment Behnam (reply to 54678)

Rob: Got it thank you 👍 It should be like this: const payload = beginCell().storeUint(0, 32).storeStringTail("increment").endCell().toBoc().toString("base64"); (reply to 54690)

Lols Anti Spam: Steve Hacks, spam is prohibited (spam)

Denis S: Hi, friends   We are looking one dev to complete our team for TON hackathon.  Please DM me if you interested.

User<7171664780>: GM Everyone 👋

Edward: Hi, Guy I have a question about the jetton internal transfer myJettonWwalletInit: StateInit;  receive(msg: Transfer) {    let qid = self.currentWithdrawCounter;    self.currentWithdrawCounter = qid + 1;     send(SendParameters{       to: contractAddress(self.myJettonWalletInit),       value: ton("0.05"),       bounce: false,       mode: SendRemainingValue,       body: TokenTransfer{          queryId: qid,          amount: msg.amount,          destination: msg.receiver,          response_destination: msg.receiver,          custom_payload: null,          forward_ton_amount: ton("0.01"),          forward_payload: emptySlice(),       }.toCell(),       code: self.myJettonWalletInit.code,       data: self.myJettonWalletInit.data,    }); } I create 2 contracts, 1 is jetton token and 1 is function contract, I try to send this receive function, but keep getting actionResultCode: 37(no enough ton or jetton?), I changed the value and forward_ton_amount to higher ton, still display same error.  In the transaction, the transaction process only reached Jetton Transfer, won't go to the next Jetton Internal Transfer and Jetton Notify.   How to solve this problem?

maksim: Hi, are you sure Jetton Wallet contract instance you are sending this to has enough jettons for the transfer? (reply to 54725)

Edward: I test it in ton/sandbox, I already mint the enough jetton, like I mint 500000000000n and I just want to transfer 20000000000n, still getting 37 actionResultCode

Edward: I checked the contract jetton wallet has enough balance to transfer

/B4ckSl4sh\: 37 means you attached not enough TONs. Use fwdTonAmount = 1. (reply to 54728)

Edward: ya, i have added fwdtoamount more than 10 still the same error

/B4ckSl4sh\: I mean try fwdTonAmount exactly 1, not 1 TON (reply to 54731)

Edward: ya, this also tried, set it to 1

/B4ckSl4sh\: You use SendRemainingValue + non zero value (reply to 54733)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Consider setting value of your message to 0 (reply to 54738)

Edward: ok, i will try it, Thanks

WhyesCode: DM me (reply to 54718)

Setmax: receive(msg: PredictMessage) {         nativeReserve(self.MinTonForStorage, ReserveExact);          emit(PredictEvent{          eventNumber: msg.eventNumber,          a_1: msg.a_1,          a_2: msg.a_2,           a_3: msg.a_3,          a_4: msg.a_4,           a_5: msg.a_5,          a_6: msg.a_6,          ton_amount: context().value,          telegram_id: msg.telegram_id,          user: sender()}.toCell());          send(SendParameters{             to: self.master,             bounce: true,             value: 0,             mode: SendRemainingBalance + SendIgnoreErrors         });     }   The initial problem has been resolved. Now, I’m just curious—how can I send the entire amount of TON to the master address while ensuring that the user pays the transaction fee separately? Is this feasible, or should I add some extra fee to the initial TON amount? (reply to 54549)

Adam: Hi if anyone need a ton dev you can dm me, dms are open for ideas and builds

Oleg: Guys, what I should choose as a lang to develop smart contracts on TON: FunC or Tact?

Я̨kov: Previously, I'd say it depends on expected gas-efficiency. However, with the upcoming 1.6.0 release, Tact's gas consumption has really dropped (up to 2.5x reduction in some cases!).  So, pick Tact — you'll learn the basics in a week, and during that time we'll make the final adjustments for 1.6.0 :)  Start here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start (reply to 54760)

DeFi Maestro: Hi, I text you. (reply to 54759)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yeah, gas consumption also depends on code size. But primarly it depends on what opcode you use (and it's amount) (reply to 54768)

Oleg: So Tact is high-level lang or low-level? (reply to 54771)

Petr: High-level (reply to 54772)

— 2025-02-20 —

Barack 💎: Aight (reply to 54780)

Anton: but you can always use `asm`-functions, so low-level at the same time (reply to 54775)

3shadow7: guys , i think of create game , is all code of my game will write in Tact ?

3shadow7: and if my code of the game was a big file , is it will cost me high gas ? or there is a way to keep things out of  block chain !

Я̨kov: Write the game without the blockchain, i.e. off-chain — blockchain fees and throughput are NOT meant for games, but for financial things.  But if you want to, you can keep track of in-game currencies (jettons), awards and achievements (soulbound nfts), or other such things using the blockchain, i.e. on-chain. (reply to 54804)

3shadow7: yeah i mean keep the objects and charctars and func of my game offchain , but things like wards insaid the game will be onchain , or maybe lemted charctars also be onchain as nft , soo is there away to keep some of things offchain and some is onchain , and also there is connect between them ?

Denis: btw, why do you use tact as tranlator to func? is it so hard to compile directly to TVM? (reply to 54762)

Philip: a) for historic reasons prior to any of team members even joining b) keep an eye on future updates :> (reply to 54826)

Jack: Hi, How to convert TL-B to Tact Message or Struct, any tools or information is appreciated :)

Jack: I want sendTransfer messages  include internal body

Anton: Hi, there is no such at this time, although the Tact team has plans to introduce it in Q1 or Q2 2025. If you share the TL-B scheme you’d like to represent, we might be able to help you with translation (reply to 54866)

Jack: thank you sir, I don't want to spend your time, I going to research.

Edward: Hi, is it possible to make snake cell in tact?

/B4ckSl4sh\: For text? (reply to 54881)

Edward: for jetton transfer from functional contract to user,  functional contract jetton wallet jetton transfer to user in tact receive(msg: Transfer) {     let ctx: Context = context();     let qid = self.currentWithdrawCounter;     self.currentWithdrawCounter = qid + 1;      send(SendParameters{        to: self.myJettonWalletAddress,        value: ton("0.1"),        body: TokenTransfer{           queryId: qid,           amount: msg.amount,           destination: msg.receiver,                   response_destination: ctx.sender,           custom_payload: null,           forward_ton_amount: 0,           forward_payload: emptySlice(),        }.toCell(), }); self.myJettonAmount =            self.myJettonAmount - msg.amount;  }

Илья: how do you get 67.2% of the amount? In Tact?

Anton: depending on your goals and your data representation it could be something like this:  asm fun muldiv(x: Int, y: Int, z: Int): Int { MULDIV }  contract Foo {     get fun test(x: Int): Int {         return muldiv(x, 672, 1000);     } } (reply to 54889)

Sun☯️: Hi friends ,can anyone help me , I need to do an contract for mint nft , can someone help me with it , maybe existing any ready  examples how to build it ? We with team already tried yesterday an few ways which we found on tact, but after mint picture of NFT is not visualized on getgems🙏

Oleg: What file is required to deploy and call contract after compilation? (without blueprint)

Sun☯️: ((((

Adam: ?? (reply to 54916)

Adam: Why you dont want to use the blueprint?

Oleg: I'm going to deploy this contract many times (reply to 54923)

Anton: you can try tact-lang/tact-template (reply to 54916)

Sun☯️: Yes it's is probably,  I have an nft on ipfs , and need contract to mint it clear (reply to 54921)

Sun☯️: U just deployed your nft there for mint ? (reply to 54929)

Sun☯️: Seems like its easier yes, hmm,  interesting,  thank u   will try (reply to 54930)

Oleg: I don't really understand what it is for, I want to understand which files are required to deploy and call contract (reply to 54925)

Sun☯️: Thank u, but how u user to Add your metadata on getgems ? But using json of nft and colction ?

Sun☯️: Yes, that's without costs, only for deploy ) (reply to 54940)

Sun☯️: Yes, I hope ,someone will see) and will give (reply to 54939)

Adam: Oh use than test (reply to 54924)

Adam: You can try contract behaviors without deploying

Adam: Or if you can use tonconnect deploy

Adam: Like that users just with ton connect can deploy contracts them selves

Oleg: I mean that I'm going deploy this contract many times not to test or something, it is for production.

Nerses: Is anyone familiar with the Fragment project? How secure is it to sell a username there, and how does the process work technically? Lately, I've been receiving multiple messages from people interested in buying my username, and it doesn’t seem like a scam. Can someone provide guidance on this?

Seva: Fragment is quite trustable (reply to 54954)

Nerses: I just cant understand how it is done technically (reply to 54955)

Abrahim: How can I use username

Nerses: I mean the part of swap.Suppose I sell my username and when my wallet accepts funds how my tg handle is changed,is it done automatically or can even fragment have access to my tg account (reply to 54956)

Seva: I think it’s architecture is quite interesting to research and explore, but here we discuss Tact language, and Fragment architecture is a little bit out of the topic. That is my opinion. (reply to 54956)

Nerses: To be frank I agree with you.Just hoped someone from fragment team will react to message (reply to 54959)

Nerses: thanks for assistance

Seva: Anything can happen here. Good journey! (reply to 54960)

Seva: Does someone has experience of writing on Tact with Grok 3 Beta? What tips can you give for achieving better results?

Petr: Hey, check rules here: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template/blob/main/.cursorrules (reply to 55009)

Skuli: Hi, I don't see the point in using grok as a chat interface via x. I recommend using cursor because it is intended for programming (reply to 55009)

Skuli: Use Cursor + tact-template

— 2025-02-23 —

Jack: hey guys , where are code and init data after compiled

Skuli: ? (reply to 55070)

Я̨kov: The code is compiled to the .boc format, and the data is simply the starting (or initial, hence "init") values for variables in the persistent state of the contract.  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#boc  Combination of initial code and data is used to obtain the address of the future contract, to where you send the deployment message with said code & data.  https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-common/#contractaddressext (reply to 55065)

Frz: I have a DAO project that I want to implement on the TON blockchain. This project allows members to earn passive income in exchange for expanding the community and increasing transactions on the TON blockchain. If you need more details, let me know and I can continue.

Ivan: Hi everyone! Quick question, just to be sure:  Am I understanding correctly: During a chain of calls where User1 triggers ParentContract -> ChildContract -> back to ParentContract, can User2 modify the state variable in ParentContract before the first chain completes?  Context: - User1 sets variable to 1 in Parent - Parent sends 1 to Child - Child sends 1 back to Parent - Parent checks if (variable == received)

— 2025-02-24 —

Jack: thank you, it works (reply to 55076)

Seva: In general — yes, because ParentContract is available for the next transaction after sending message to the ChildContract, however you can build the architecture of the smart-contract in a way, that User2 would not be able to modify the state variable in ParentContract before the first chain completes. For example you can implement a counter state variable that's state is updated once the whole chain of transactions is executed (the message from ChildContract came back to ParentContract) (reply to 55126)

Andrew: "Hello everyone, how can I obtain DEX swap records by parsing blocks on the TON blockchain?"

Fire: I can help you for that part

Andrew: please give me a demo

Barack 💎: Is this chat same as the other TON chats. The chat dev I were kicks someone for just requesting to know something. This is so sad. You guys should tell us the important thing about this chat groups then because we are here to learn right? I was pissed because I never share anything bad in the group 😡

Barack 💎: If you don’t want people to share insights then make the group only admin exclusive 😤

Dmitry: Hey guys! Do we have a SBT implementation in Tact?

Anton: hey, I haven’t seen one yet, there are some NFT contracts in https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact though (reply to 55191)

Dmitry: I guess SBT is just a regular NFT without transfers, am I right? 😅

Obe: hello everyone i am new here and i was wondering if anyone can point me in the way of study materials i can use for learning ton smart contract programming

Я̨kov: Hello, you can start here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start  In addition, take a look at awesome-tact, which has many great resources, tools, guides, and more: https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact (reply to 55216)

Alex: I’m getting 135 exit code during contract deploy. Looks like that because I use initOf other contract in init of my contract. Any way how I can solve that? I need other contract to be owner of my contract and I don’t want to pass it as arg in init and I don’t want to use sender() as well

Anton: Could you please share a reproducible example? We have tests with initOf in the init function of a contract, so that is supported (reply to 55239)

Alex: I can’t share example due to NDA. But I figured it out:  I used separate function that returns address of contract:   fun master_addr(): Address{     return contractAddress(initOf MasterV0()); }  once I changed my init to use contractAddress(initOf MasterV0()) instead of master_addr() it started to work (reply to 55243)

Anton: Thanks for sharing. We will try to reproduce (reply to 55247)

Maxim: Hi guys! Is there any way to find out what computeFee is made up of in a specific part of transaction? It looks like one simple operation burns to much gas

/B4ckSl4sh\: you can use dump(getComputeFee()) and then calculate the difference (reply to 55300)

Maxim: difference with what? (reply to 55302)

Maxim: that's actual figures (reply to 55301)

Maxim: Tact compilation failed Error: Static function "getComputeFee" does not exist (reply to 55302)

/B4ckSl4sh\: you can place dump(getComputeFee()) before the place that consumes gas, and after that place (reply to 55303)

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced/#getcomputefee (reply to 55305)

/B4ckSl4sh\: it should be available (reply to 55307)

Я̨kov: Maybe you're using the older VSCode extension that suggests you wrong things?  Try upgrading the compiler and/or installing different plugins, we recently had a lot of new things published: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact#tooling (reply to 55305)

Maxim: getComputeFee Available since Tact 1.5  maybe I have an older version

Maxim: yep, I have 1.4.3

Я̨kov: Oh, that's a rather old version. Try upgrading it: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#upgrades (reply to 55311)

Sỹ: Thank you! (reply to 55345)

Anton: we need more context to understand your issue (reply to 55367)

Hung: Hello, I just started developing yesterday, so I have a very beginner-level question.  I can't access the .ton domain network. I carefully read the documentation stating that a specific proxy must be used as a "secret gateway," and I have tried everything—from the proxy provided by Ton Wallet to the connector.exe available on GitHub. However, I still can't connect.  Could it be that my country (or region) is banned?  When I use a proxy and fail to connect in Chrome, I get error codes like ERR_TIMEOUT and ERR_PROXY. When I disable the proxy and fail, I receive a DNS ERROR code.

Z: Hello, are the random numbers obtained by the random method in tact completely random? I checked the documentation and found that func requires seeds, but does tact not?

Daniil: try this one https://github.com/xssnick/Tonutils-Proxy?tab=readme-ov-file#download-precompiled-version (reply to 55382)

Я̨kov: Common functions for random numbers in Tact do not require you to provide the seed: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-random/  That said, under the hood they do setup the RNG in the same way as it's commonly done in FunC, see https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced/#nativepreparerandom and following functions (reply to 55393)

&rey: Proposition about fundamental limitations for some languages: in Tact, you can't have a single function which'd group querying SBT's data, receiving it and handling it some more (e.g. set loan rate according to past achievements).

Daniil: is it even a good idea to allow doing this in context of TON architecture? (reply to 55398)

&rey: In some proof-carrying languages it might be OK, if you have tools to reason about synchronization. (reply to 55399)

Philip: Let's assume it is. If you understand what was meant, please, explain (reply to 55399)

Philip: oh, I probably understood  you're talking about the case when some linear code executes in context of several contracts (reply to 55400)

&rey: That, and {   let achievement: SBT = ...;   let owner: 'sometime Address = achievement.query_owner().await;   ... } (reply to 55401)

Philip: and it's not only possible, but I thought about it :)

Philip: TVM is a very good target for this

Sỹ: Hi, if I define a message with some string as input. But I don't store it in contract, would it cost storage fee? If someone send very long string to the contract, how can filter such message. I am aware of require(condition, some_message), can it be used for this purpose?

maksim: You don't pay storage fee's for incoming messages, only if you store it (reply to 55448)

Don: Hi guys is the a way to make contracts upgradeable in tact?

Dmitry: Yes, but it will require to use assembly function with SETCODE instruction (reply to 55489)

Dmitry: Like that:  asm fun setCode(code: Cell) { SETCODE }

Maxim: Hey, Guys! How to set minimum amount for Tonkeeper transfer? I have defined a check for incoming value, but it doesn't work - it returns an error code, while Tonkeeper still misses this requirement during transaction fee calculation.

Sỹ: Your UI code need to handle that when it send TokenTransfer request. The contract's already checked incoming value and aborted which is correct. (reply to 55498)

Maxim: Absolutely, if I use my own UI I can set the amount of fee to whatever I want. But what if I use Tonkeeper instead of my own UI and just want to send a transaction?

Maxim: Maybe, I could add some fake code, that would generate calculations and increase cost of transaction while Tonkeeper estimates transaction fee (but it shouldn't actually be executed) Any ideas?

Sỹ: Your mesage is custom   format. How can you send it through tokeeper.

Maxim: I would like to send standard message TokenTransfer (0xf8a7ea5)

Sỹ: I think you are sending 10 token , not 10 TON. Maybe add dump(context().value) and dump(msg.amount) before your checks to see what it is.

Maxim: yes, it was 10 TOKENs, not TONs (reply to 55511)

Sỹ: If you don't want to hold ton in the contract then just remove the check.

Maxim: I need more fee to be able to pay for forward messages

Sỹ: Fee is about 0.003 ton or smthing. You can look it up and set proper number. (reply to 55518)

Sỹ: 0.25 is very high

Maxim: I need exactly that much, I have already calculated it practically. In general, of course, you need less, but in my case for some reason if you put less, the transaction does not go through. And with this amount, everything goes through, but at the same time half of this amount is returned as change with TokenExcesses (0xd53276db)

Sỹ: If that's the case, I can't help. Gl!

Maxim: But what if the wallet contract stores a large amount of data and for this the minimum amount of TON on the balance must be 0.25 TON? It turns out that I can't activate such a contract with a simple transfer, since not enough TON coins will be transferred? (reply to 55522)

Sỹ: Sorry, that is beyond my knowledge. I believe you are doing much complex thing than I ever do with TON. (reply to 55528)

Anton: 🎉 Tact v1.6.0 is released!  🏆 This is the biggest update of Tact since its creation, bigger than all previous milestones combined. There were so many improvements that we've even won over FunC in terms of gas usage on many standard contracts, such as Jettons. 🤔 Don't believe me? 🥳 Let's unpack Tact v1.6.0 together and see these improvements for ourselves!  We'll start with the number one achievement of this release:  ⛽️ Gas optimization victory over FunC  Gas has long been a major pain point for Tact. Prior to v1.6.0, Tact's gas usage on many common contracts, such as Jettons, was far from ideal, requiring about 2.5 times gas of the FunC reference implementation.  But with Tact 1.6.0, those old gas-expensive days are long gone.  🤯 For example, a Tact rewrite of the reference FunC Jetton code consumes less gas for transfer, burn and discovery messages! 😎 So, expect to receive easy-to-use idiomatic Tact implementations of common contracts in the near future  Some of the things we did to achieve this: ▪️ Removed "system" cell — parent contract code is no longer stored in the system cell with all the child contract codes ▪️ Removed redundant address checks ▪️ Deprecated Deployable trait in favor of receive(){} ▪️ Introduced contract parameters as an alternative to init() function  And optimized compiler internals, many old and new functions in the stdlib:  🧰 Some of the standard library additions and changes  • Added specialized deploy and message functions for efficient on-chain deployments and non-deployment messages respectively • Many math functions, such as divc, mulShiftRightCeil, and others • More advanced functions, such as setGasLimit, setSeed, myCode, and others • Handy throwIf and throwUnless functions, which deprecated their "native" prefixed counterparts • Optimized emptyCell and emptySlice functions • Int.toString function now consumes up to 64% less gas • Int.toFloatString function now consumes up to 62% less gas  Added many functions for Cell, Slice and Builder types: •  Variable integer serialization types and the corresponding .load and .store functions of Slice and Builder types • Functions Slice.hashData and String.hashData for efficient hashes of data only • Functions for working with addresses: Slice.asAddress, Slice.asAddressUnsafe, contractHash, and a new BasechainAddress type its helper functions • ...and more!  🧳 More auxiliary things  • Basic let-destructuring of structs and Messages • Compile-time method ID expressions for getters and Message opcodes • The codeOf expression to get the code of child contracts • More map improvements and new methods, like replace and replaceGet • New augmented assignment operators &&=, ||=, >>= and <<= • Better error reporting for many cases • Generation of constants in TypeScript wrappers • The -w, --watch CLI flags for watching for changes and automatic recompilations • CLI for the Tact's TVM disassembler — unboc • Fixes of the compilation report • Fixes of the compiler's third-party API • Fixes of the internal infrastructure and code generation • Lots of other miscellaneous bug fixes and smaller enhancements • ...and documentation for all of that and beyond!  Besides, check out the updated Awesome Tact list and add your awesome projects, especially those using Tact in production!  ⚠️ Breaking changes  There are only two, and they're both pretty minor:  • Tact 1.6.0 replaces Context.bounced field with Context.bounceable, which tells whether the received message can bounce back or not. Previously, the bounced was useless since any bounced messages would be handled in a separate bounced() receiver.  • The enabledMasterchain option was removed from tact.config.json. Going forward, support of masterchain addresses is always enabled in Tact contracts.  ♥️ Special thanks goes to all the contributors and community members — without you there would be nothing. Let's keep building the future of smart contracts with ⚡️ Tact! 📜 See full release notes for Tact v1.6.0 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  🍲 we're beating the gas allegations with this one 🗣🗣🗣 ♨️ @tact_kitchen (forwarded from Tact Kitchen)

Anton: Time to upgrade folks!

Dmitry: If you want to challenge your knowledges - check it out  https://t.me/hacktheton/138

Denis: now tact gas consumption is +- same as using func or there are optimizations that makes it use less gas? 🙂 (reply to 55569)

Anton: Tact now provides some out-of-the-box optimizations that people can also replicate in FunC with some magic Fift techniques. Most optimizations are in the code generator but some requires some planning from the smart contracts dev, for instance, using the new features and stdlib functions like - contract parameters   - Basechain Addresses - deploy and message functions instead of send  We are working on a new page in the Tact docs which provides some guidelines on how to do gas optimizations in your Tact contracts. Will be published next week, stay tuned :) (reply to 55577)

Setmax: Hey Anton, Great job on the upgrade! Do you have an estimated timeline for the contract upgrade feature? (reply to 55578)

Philip: Why estimate if it's already there?  https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/upgrades/ (reply to 55579)

&rey: Is function for converting contract data [onchain] in plans? (reply to 55580)

Philip: I've just created an issue. This will be tough though, and I'm not sure how soon we get there. (reply to 55589)

Andrey: Greate job, guys! Thank you!

Andrey: Does it work correctly? The last time I used this method, it broke address calculations with child contracts. I suspect this is due to the presence of a cell with the contract code itself in the state. (reply to 55580)

Я̨kov: Should be. There's no "system" cell anymore — Tact no longer stores the parent contract code in the system cell with all the child contract codes used in initOf expression. Instead, the myCode function and related instruction are used.  However, if your logic is too complex to lay out flat (some recursive dependencies), then there would be a system-like cell. But in that case, upgrades would be very hard even if it wasn't there :) (reply to 55592)

Amir: Hi everyone,   I’m working on a TON smart contract called PixelSelection and need some help modifying the SelectPixels message handling code. I’ve included the relevant contract and client code below, along with details of an error I encountered. I’d really appreciate your insights on how to fix this and improve the functionality!  Overview of the Current Code  The PixelSelection contract allows users to select pixels by sending a SelectPixels message with a bigPixel value. The contract then extracts up to eachSelected (set between 2 and 25) 3-digit numbers from bigPixel and processes them as pixel selections if they meet certain conditions (e.g., not already selected, within bounds, etc.). Here's the key part of the contract:

Amir: receive(msg: SelectPixels) {     let divisor: Int = self.gameConfig.minValue; // e.g., 1_000_000 for eachSelected = 2     self.safeSend();     require(!self.gameConfig.gameEnded, "Game Ended");     require(msg.bigPixel >= self.gameConfig.minValue && msg.bigPixel < self.gameConfig.maxValue, "Invalid pixel");      let falseNumber = self.gameConfig.falseNumber; // e.g., 9     let remaining = msg.bigPixel % divisor;     let digitsLeft = self.gameConfig.totalDigits; // e.g., 6 for eachSelected = 2     let counter = 0;      let currentTime: Int = now();     let threeDigits = falseNumber;     while (digitsLeft >= 3) {         threeDigits = remaining % 1000; // Extract 3 digits         if ((threeDigits != falseNumber) && (threeDigits < self.gameConfig.totalGamePixels)         && (counter < self.gameConfig.eachSelected) && (!self.isPixelSelected(threeDigits))) {             self.pixelData.set(threeDigits, PixelData{...});             emit(PixelSelectedEvent{...}.toCell());             counter = counter + 1;         }         remaining = remaining / 1000;         digitsLeft = digitsLeft - 3;     }      require(counter != 0 , "No Valid Data Selected");     let total_cost: Int = self.gameConfig.price * counter;     require(context().value >= total_cost, "Insufficient funds");     // Payment processing follows... }

Amir: The client-side JavaScript code sends the SelectPixels message like this:

Amir: const bigPixel = 2; // Test value const messageBody = beginCell()     .storeUint(0x15952fac, 32) // Operation code     .storeUint(bigPixel, 32)   // bigPixel value     .endCell();  await walletContract.sendTransfer({     seqno: seqno,     secretKey: keyPair.secretKey,     messages: [internal({         to: contractAddress,         value: toNano("0.05"),         body: messageBody,         bounce: true,     })] });

Amir: The Problem  I deployed the contract on the TON testnet and tried sending a SelectPixels transaction with bigPixel = 2. However, the transaction failed with an error. Here’s the transaction log:   Timestamp: Mar 2, 2025, 03:14:08 AM Hash: a03289db8f0d117c4e562cc6a3786084b90d51b7134cc5830b1de5a0e92e7f1e  From: 0QBqTfI7lR3GhBY3TCiruGaFdlvsbms9xQ8y4TvmXvhJxa-u To: kQAjskv9ZlomJHwzs4KrEWyluFizhIQTgRlrXnenjznRmdOp  TON Amount: 0.01 TON Op Code: 0x15952fac  Status: Error Success: False   I suspect the issue is related to the bigPixel value or how it’s processed in the contract. With eachSelected = 2, minValue = 1_000_000, and maxValue = 2_000_000, the contract expects bigPixel to be a 6-digit number (e.g., 1_234_567). Sending bigPixel = 2 fails the requirement msg.bigPixel >= self.gameConfig.minValue, which could explain the error.  Questions for Help  Fixing the Input Value: Should I modify the client code to send a valid bigPixel (e.g., 1_234_567)? What’s a good test value for eachSelected = 2 and totalGamePixels = 9? Or should I adjust the contract’s minValue and maxValue to accept smaller numbers like 2?    Improving SelectPixels Logic: The current logic extracts 3-digit numbers from bigPixel and checks them against conditions. How could I simplify this or make it more flexible (e.g., support variable digit lengths)?  Any suggestions to handle edge cases better (e.g., when no valid pixels are selected)?    Debugging the Error: How can I get more detailed error info from the testnet to confirm why it failed? Is there a way to log revert reasons in TON?    General Enhancements: Any other improvements you’d recommend for the SelectPixels functionality or the contract overall?

Ash: Hello Everyone, Can anyone help me with this?  I'm writing an Airdrop contract in Tact where I have used signature-based airdrop minting on TON:    🔹 Off-Chain: Signature Generation 1️⃣ Create a Cell storing:  User’s address (storeAddress) Reward amount (storeInt with 256 bits) 2️⃣ Convert the Cell to bytes (toBoc()). 3️⃣ Sign the bytes using Ed25519 with the private key. 4️⃣ Save the signature, user address, and reward in signedAirdropData.json.   🔹 On-Chain: Signature Verification 1️⃣ The contract receives:  User address Reward amount Signature (as a Slice)  2️⃣ Recreates the same Cell with: Provided user address Provided reward amount 3️⃣ Converts the Cell to a Slice. 4️⃣ Uses checkDataSignature to verify the signature. ✅

Ash: I'm unable to mint tokens because the checkDataSignature function keeps returning false (reply to 55659)

Ash: I have used ton/crypto for signature verification off chain and is giving me false. Please someone help me with this    import { Address, beginCell } from '@ton/core'; import { signVerify } from '@ton/crypto';  async function verifySignature(     userAddress: string,    // User's wallet address     amount: bigint,         // Amount in nanotons     signature: string,      // Hex signature     publicKey: string       // Public key in hex ): Promise<boolean> {     // 1. Create the same message that was signed     const message = beginCell()         .storeAddress(Address.parse(userAddress))         .storeInt(amount, 256)         .endCell();          // 2. Get the bytes of the message     const messageBytes = message.toBoc();      // 3. Convert hex strings to Buffers     const signatureBuffer = Buffer.from(signature, 'hex');     const publicKeyBuffer = Buffer.from(publicKey.replace('0x', ''), 'hex');          // 4. Verify the signature     return signVerify(messageBytes, signatureBuffer, publicKeyBuffer); }  // Example usage: async function main() {     verifySignature(         "EQD2NmD_lH5f_TRb6ewqNYVAKHjwxK7bVxOjvT1-GTj9jqhF",         69000000000n,         "your_signature_hex",         "0x6cd68c8b3b2e6db246837eb2e7521d2ee15fa9502cb10d0deb889a11b38a9c89"     ).then(console.log); }  main();

Ash: My public key, signature, address and reward all are correct and I have used this function to generate the signature       const message = beginCell()         .storeAddress(Address.parse(userAddress))         .storeInt(toNano(reward), 256)         .endCell();          // Get the bytes to sign (instead of the hash)     const dataBytes = message.toBoc();          // Sign the data bytes directly     const signature = sign(dataBytes, keyPair.secretKey); (reply to 55673)

bulul: Hello everyone! I'm a bit new to contracts and I'm planning to develop my own GameFi product. I have the following question: we are planning to use Go language on the backend, but I was told that Tact works better with Rust. Maybe I don't understand something. But at what stage and with what does Tact integrate? And where do we store the points tapped by the user?  Thanks for the answers!!

bulul: And I have one question.  Where should the points tapped in the game by the user be stored?

Я̨kov: Generally, they should be stored in your database and handled by your backend. Blockchain is a database for the financial operations, but it is not a good place for in-game events and currency, unless that currency is about to be converted to or from Toncoin (reply to 55814)

bulul: I love you!  I was also recommended to store the points on the ipfs network. Is this nonsense or not? (reply to 55817)

Я̨kov: Seems to be — IPFS is for storage, but a large number of writes (such as in your case) would defeat its purpose, IMO (reply to 55818)

Ash: The Contract is always returning false when I try to run checkDataSignature function.  Can anyone help me with this? I tried every approach, but wasn't able to find any solutions to it (reply to 55771)

Nurda: Hello everyone 👋🏻   We are developing a mini-app that will soon be ready for the release.   Are there any built-in methods for promoting mini-applications in Telegram?

Philip: Is it written in Tact? (reply to 55821)

Nurda: Yeah

Anton: sounds cool, is it opensource? (reply to 55823)

Nurda: No, it’s just a mini game app

Philip: Then unfortunately there's not much this chat can help you with

Nurda: I’m looking for marketing. Are there any Telegram integrated services to promote the app?

Philip: This is not a marketing chat, this is a developer chat

Nurda: Yeah I’ve noticed. Sorry for that. Just don’t know whom to ask for

Sata: Could anyone help me with this, when I derive the contract's wallet just after deploying it, the address is always inactive even when I fund it with jettons and ton, is there any solution for this? To automate jetton transfer through the contract (reply to 55756)

Ash: Tact team , can you please help me with this? (reply to 55820)

Anton: can you please make a standalone repo with a test showing what is not working and some clear instructions how to install the dependencies and run the test? (reply to 55838)

Daniil: You’re calculating the signature wrong. You should not convert it to BoC but just take a hash of it and sign this hash. Then in smart contract you also take the signed cell’s hash to verify it. (reply to 55771)

Duc: Good morning everyone I am writing TON smart contract with Tact  I have written a function to receive a message like below (in Jetton contract) receive(msg: TransferUSDT){         let ctx: Context = context();         require(self.admin.get(ctx.sender) == true, "Not Admin");         let winit: StateInit = self.getUSDTWalletInit(self.USDTWalletAddress, msg.to);         send(SendParameters{                 to: contractAddress(winit),                 value: 0,                 bounce: false,                 mode: SendRemainingValue,                 body: TokenTransferInternal{                     queryId: now(),                     amount: msg.amount,                     from: myAddress(),                     forward_ton_amount: 0,                     forward_payload: rawSlice("0")                 }.toCell(),                 code: winit.code,                 data: winit.data             }         );     } and a script to call the that message: await profToken.send(         provider.sender(),         {             value: toNano('0.1'),         },         {             $$type: 'TransferUSDT',             to: userAddress,             amount: toNano("0.00001"), // 0.001 USDTUSDT         },     );  But i keep getting failed transaction with error "Insufficient amount" Note that the contract has 0.81 TON and 0.05 USDT (meaning the contract has enough money to do the transaction) Thank u so much

Anton: are you sure this means 0.001 USDT and not 10000 USDT? (reply to 55891)

Duc: i mean 0.01 USDT

Anton: you are using toNano which multiplies that argument by 10^9 (reply to 55903)

Duc: i have tried 30000n but it didn't work

Anton: what are the measure units for amount do you have any documentation on this? (reply to 55905)

Duc: i'm searching by ChatGpt

Duc: If USDT has 6 decimal places (like USDT on Ethereum, BSC, or TON): 0.03 USDT=0.03×10^6=30,000

kira: this is an argument in message "TransferUSDT", being declared as  message TransferUSDT {   to: Address;   amount: Int as coins; } (reply to 55906)

Hoang: Does anyone know where I can obtain USDT Jetton on the testnet?

Anton: 🎉 Tact v1.6.2 is released!  Release a day keeps the sanitarians away.   Seriously though, before we commit to the next big release, refining rough edges and adding useful things to the standard library is always nice without making you wait for them for long. To discover such points of improvement, we actively collect feedback that we see in Tact chats and that we receive from the teams that actively use Tact in production.  We're not yet done with all the suggestions, so apart from this release, there are plans to make at least one more patch release with possible bug fixes and additions to the standard library.  ❤️ All constructive feedback is welcome — let's enjoy writing ⚡️ Tact together!  On that note, let's quickly unpack the v1.6.2:  🛠 Bug fixes  • An empty init() function is no longer implicitly added when empty contract parameters are declared. This is done to save gas and storage, and it is backward compatible with the lazy initialization that Tact offered as the sole data initialization mechanism before v1.6.0.  • Compiler no longer screams at you if the message struct becomes small enough to fit into the 224 bits and does not require an explicit bounced<M> constructor. That was a noisy warning, and it's much better without it.  • Contract constructors are now public in TypeScript wrappers.  • Now, if getters do not have explicit method ID overrides in Tact code, they are called by their name and not their numeric IDs in the generated TypeScript wrappers. This change restores the pre-1.6.0 behavior that was important for compatibility with some third-party tools that do not support calling getters by their method IDs.  • Compiler upgrades via npm i now work as they should. Note that upgrades through the npm update --save command continue working, too.  🧰 Standard library additions and changes  • Doc comments, doc comments everywhere! They're especially fun to use with the language server, see more info on that below.  • Added Slice.skipRef, Slice.skipMaybeRef, Slice.skipBool, Slice.skipCoins, Slice.skipVarUint16, Slice.skipVarInt16, Slice.skipVarUint32, Slice.skipVarInt32, Slice.skipAddress functions.  📜 See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.2 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  The alpha testing for the new TON Studio's official Tact language server continues. Have you tried it? It also has a neat VSCode extension and an extension for VSCode-based editors!  Here's a quick rundown of their features: • Semantic syntax highlighting • Code completion with auto import, postfix completion, snippets, and import completion • Go to definition, implementation, type definition • Find all references, workspace symbol search, symbol renaming • Types and documentation on hover • Inlay hints for types, parameter names, and more • On-the-fly inspections with quick fixes • Signature help inside calls, and actions for initOf and struct initialization • Lenses with implementation/reference counts • Gas estimates for assembly functions • Commands for building and testing projects based on Blueprint and tact-template • Integration with Tact compiler and Misti static analyzer  Sounds exciting? Install it and tell us what needs improvement — the language server is quite new, but it matures very fast!  🍲 please try to enjoy each release equally ♨️ @tact_kitchen from the @ton_studio (forwarded from Tact Kitchen)

Sata: testgiver_ton_usdt_bot  You can get testnet usdt on this bot (reply to 56077)

Sehm: /I need help to build a dapp for SBT claim.

Skuli: Hi everyone! Does anyone know if there is a utility that automatically checks the validity of a contract before deploying? I get an "error" when deploying a contract. I tried to catch it through sandbox, but it didn't work. Is there something more universal?

Dmitry: Error code? (reply to 56112)

Skuli: I mean I want to see this error locally when deploying. I don't want to see it when the contract is deployed to the block chain. I want to deploy the contract locally to see these kinds of problems. (reply to 56114)

Dmitry: Ah, I see

Dmitry: It’s interesting how Tonkeeper emulates transactions, maybe there are some methods for that in ton library or something like that

Skuli: tone sandbox can't help with this? (reply to 56117)

Dmitry: Sure, you can try to deploy in sandbox and inspect vm trace

Dmitry: Why it didn’t work for you?

Skuli: I'll try to look at sandbox again.  I just want to achieve a result where I can see everything immediately at the stage of the problem's appearance, and not in production

Dmitry: Yeah, sandbox should be perfect for that (reply to 56121)

Petr: Send me the file in DM please

Mohammad: Thank you

Petr: Windows things, will be fixed in 0.4 this Monday 🙂

mansudo: yo everyone, im new, what's the diff between tact and tolk langs? is tact considered tolk successor like tolk is to FunC?

Я̨kov: Kind of. Tolk was an attempt to modernize FunC, while Tact is a production-ready and battle-tested language focused on efficiency and simplicity. It has lots of distinct features and it's also safe — we've passed a thorough security audit by Trail of Bits last autumn.  Tact has comprehensive documentation, ever-expanding collection of great tooling and long-lasting plans for the future.  Come aboard: https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start  And check out selected update notices in the @tact_kitchen 👋 (reply to 56197)

mansudo: Thanks. The question ofc is compiler. It's pretty costly (reply to 56200)

mansudo: At least that's what i've heard, because it compiles to funC eventually, which is compiled to fift

Я̨kov: That's a thing of the past. Although we still compile to FunC, we now employ a wide range of optimizations which are tough and cumbersome to do when programming in FunC directly.  See: https://t.me/tact_kitchen/58 (reply to 56201)

Ivan: hey everyone =) is the SendParameters value limited to 0.4 TON, or can I set it higher even though no more than 0.4 TON will actually be spent?

Ivan: I just want to find a simple payment method and don't want to store user balances

Я̨kov: You can send more than 0.4 Toncoin in any transfer :) (reply to 56420)

Ivan: So to confirm, I can set value > 0.4 TON in SendParameters? Just want to make sure =) (reply to 56422)

Я̨kov: Yes, you can  send(SendParameters{     value: ton("5"), // this will send 5 Toncoin     to: sender(), });  Just make sure that the contract has enough funds for this, or you'll get exit code 37 in the action phase: Not enough Toncoin (reply to 56423)

Я̨kov: In your tests and other scripts, replace { $$type: 'Deploy, queryId: 0n } or similar to just null  And then make sure that your contracts have an null message body receiver, i.e. an empty one: receive()  :) (reply to 56447)

Ilia: thanks, mate! very much obliged. (reply to 56448)

Я̨kov: No problem. The Deployable trait and related message structs were too expensive to use compared to simple deployments with a null message body.  By the way, to send excesses back on deployment, instead of the empty receive(){}, starting with Tact 1.6.1 you could have receve(){ cashback(sender()) } (reply to 56449)

Я̨kov: I'll try to update the templates in Blueprint soon to match the changes we've made :) (reply to 56450)

KTO: Помогите решить проблему. Смарт-контракт NFT коллекции не определяется на версии 1.6.2  Хотя тот же смарт-контракт на версии 1.5.3 работает нормально

Ilia: Ok. It works. But now upon execution I see that:   1) transaction has deploy: false instead of deploy: true 2) transaction has success: false  3) transaction bounced  But contract was indeed deployed.  Are those intentional? (reply to 56448)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Did you add empty. receiver?  like  receive() {  //cashback(sender()) <- if needed } (reply to 56458)

Ilia: I certainly did not. 8 ) Thank you. Is there a place in docs I'm missing? (reply to 56459)

Я̨kov: Well, there are two and both will be edited soon:  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/receive/ — this is mostly right https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/deploy — this requires heavy edits (reply to 56460)

Ilia: I see. Looking forward to updates, then. (reply to 56461)

Я̨kov: By the way, do you use https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server? It has just got inspections and quick fixes for replacing Deployable trait in contracts. And in terms of other features, there is a lot :)  It's in open alpha now, so if you find any issues with it, you can report them here or on its bug tracker: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/issues  Hope it helps ❤️ (reply to 56462)

Ilia: I have VS Code plugin installed. But to be honest beyond syntax highlighting does not help much. Will look into it. Thanks. (reply to 56463)

Я̨kov: Oh, then you probably have the old one! The new one is here.  It conflicts with the previous extension, so it's better to keep only one installed, preferably the newer one :) (reply to 56466)

Ilia: No. This is the one I'm using. (reply to 56467)

Ilia: Looks like I had issues with standard library path, I see more hints now. Thank you. (reply to 56467)

KTO: Will they help me? Why is the NFT collection interface not defined on version 1.6.2? (reply to 56454)

Я̨kov: Does this issue persist on NFT explorers specifically, like GetGems and such? (reply to 56484)

KTO: getgems shows the collection, but the NFT explorers don't show (reply to 56486)

KTO: It is also not displayed in the TonKeeper wallet. And ton.cx He can't identify her either. (reply to 56486)

Я̨kov: Hmm, it's quite peculiar. I don't know what caused it, but we'll look into it deeper in the near future.  After all, once the Jetton implementation in Tact is ready for production, we'll do other standard contracts like NFTs :) (reply to 56488)

KTO: But after all, on version 1.5.3 everything works fine and is displayed. (reply to 56489)

KTO: Is there really no way to solve this problem? (reply to 56489)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Tomorrow we will dive deep into this (reply to 56491)

KTO: For the test, I used this smart contract:  https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-template-in-tact (reply to 56492)

Я̨kov: Well, the getters/methods are still there, which means it might be an issue on the explorers side. Once again, we'll try to test some more soon :) (reply to 56491)

Алексей: Is there any reason why tact-lang/jetton doesn't use @stdlib/ownable traits?

Daniil: Toncenter works fine, the problem is on tonapi/tonscan side.  We’ll figure it out with them (reply to 56454)

Anton: That trait hardcodes the exit code and initially we wanted to just replicate the reference contract by TON Core (reply to 56534)

Алексей: But require also kind of hardcodes exit code deriving it from error message 🤔 (reply to 56536)

Anton: Yeah, so I personally prefer throwUnless for that reason (reply to 56537)

Ash: Hello developers, anyone ready to do Freelance? I have a functionality in Tact Smart Contract to complete

&rey: Sounds like there should be an autogenerated method sendAny for testing contract on malformed messages / sending no body / etc. (reply to 56448)

Philip: That was the plan for nextgen wrappers. Unfortunately this means we'll have to circumvent majority of the code in Sandbox, and that's not easy (reply to 56567)

&rey: "malformed" message payloads, then? Ones the contract doesn't expect. (reply to 56570)

Philip: ? (reply to 56571)

Philip: Malformed payloads are hard to pass, because Sandbox was build to force users into using contract's interface

Philip: It's already possible to get blockchain.provider(), and do low-level send on it, but extending contract's interface with that would be tedious and unsafe

Philip: Basically we'll have to redo the whole interface of Sandbox just to get our wrappers fixed, so it will take time

Я̨kov: If you mean to send messages bodies with unexpected opcodes, then that can be done via your proposed sendAny and/or in a similar manner, yeah  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes/#130 (reply to 56571)

Алексей: The most easy way to deploy contract is to use blueprint, run yarn blueprint run or smth like that (reply to 56702)

Z: Hello, I wrote a sales contract using tact, and printed out some information using emit. My plan is to use Go to search for these emits and save them in the database. Is this reasonable?

Z: Since tact does not have an approval-like operation in solidity, when using tokens to purchase goods in the tact contract, the user needs to transfer the token directly to the contract. After the transfer is completed, some necessary post-purchase contract logic is processed in TokenNotification. Is this correct?

Алексей: I think I found a bug, for this simple contract  message Test {     refferer: Address? }  contract Main() {     receive() {         cashback(sender());     }      receive(msg: Test) {         cashback(sender());     } }   Tact generates following tlb: ### Test TL-B: test#e6e73381 refferer:Maybe address = Test Signature: Test{refferer:Maybe address}  And when I send  {     $$type: "Test",     refferer: Address.parse("0QBUFT1SH0IglM6VSb8iTPUqElMnK-goI85_f1A_XYXlwwvA") }   The resulting message body has cell with 32bit opcode + 267bit address, but it has no maybe bit before address, isn't it a conflict with tlb 🤔

Philip: Unfortunately that's not just bug at our side, that's a widespread bug over the whole ecosystem.  Take a look at these lines for loading Address? in @ton/core library (reply to 56713)

Philip: At some point of time someone decided that "optional address" is optional if it might be an addr_none, but the address can be addr_none even if it wasn't optional

Philip: In one of the next versions of Tact we'll try to fix it on our side by making a correct independent implementation of block.tlb, but before that we have what we have

Алексей: And @ton/core won't fix that? (reply to 56716)

Philip: Maybe I wasn't too clear when I reported the bug a few months ago, but, well, no. (reply to 56719)

Philip: And I'm not sure it's @ton/core to blame here. Maybe they have it for compatibility with someone else

Valentyn: 🚨 Need Help with Deploying a Smart Contract on TON 🚨    I'm trying to deploy a smart contract on TON but keep getting errors when sending deploy-full.boc via lite-client. I generate deploy-full.boc using fift with the command:   rm deploy-full.boc && fift -I /Users/valentinvdovicenko/ton-nft-marketplace/ton/crypto/fift/lib -s deploy-full.fif && ls -l deploy-full.boc && hexdump -C deploy-full.boc   Then, I send it using:   lite-client -C /Users/valentinvdovicenko/ton-nft-marketplace/mainnet-global.config.json -c "sendfile /Users/valentinvdovicenko/ton-nft-marketplace/deploy-full.boc"   I keep getting errors like "cannot apply external message to current state: failed to parse external message: external message is not a (Message Any) according to automated checks", "server version is too old (at least 1.1 with capabilities 1 required), some queries are unavailable", "timeout for adnl query query", and "failed to parse external message". How can I verify if deploy-full.boc is correctly generated and ensure the lite-client is working properly? Any help would be appreciated! 🙏

/B4ckSl4sh\: You definitely don't take the easy way out (reply to 56749)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Why do you need to deploy your contract using lite-server binary? (reply to 56750)

Valentyn: "That's not my style—I go all in. No shortcuts, just results. 😎" (reply to 56750)

Valentyn: "I need to deploy my contract using the lite-client binary because I'm working directly with the TON blockchain, and it allows me to send raw external messages efficiently. If there's a better approach, I'm open to suggestions!" (reply to 56751)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Are you sure you have latest lite-client?   https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.03 (reply to 56749)

Алексей: Yeah I am not sure what is deploy-full.fif, likely the problem is there (reply to 56749)

Gosha: Hello! Am I correct in understanding that message(params: MessageParameters) is only used for sending Toncoin, and if I want to send some meaningful message, I should use send(params: SendParameters)?

Алексей: The meaningful part is body of the message. You can pass body both in MessageParamters and SendParameters (reply to 56758)

Алексей: However with message(params: MessageParameters) you cannot deploy new contract

Gosha: So docs are wrong?

Алексей: I think it should be data, not body. I think this a typo yes, but maybe I am wrong.. (reply to 56761)

&rey: Well I believe the code is correct, meaning TL-B is not. (reply to 56713)

Алексей: Also I am kind of curious why tact need send() at this point when it has message() and deploy() 🤔

Anton: Already fixed in the main branch, will be released next week with a couple more fixes and improvements (reply to 56763)

&rey: Mm... isn't it kind of early considering upcoming node changes in handling varaddrs? (reply to 56765)

Anton: It had send originally and then we added the optimized deploy and message functions, while keeping send for backwards compatibility (reply to 56764)

&rey: Suppose you'd Iike to unfreeze a contract. How'd you go about that in Tact? (reply to 56764)

Valentyn: Yes, exactly. message(params: MessageParameters) is mostly for sending Toncoin, whereas send(params: SendParameters) lets you include a meaningful message body. But for deploying a new contract, you’d need to send an external message with StateInit, which isn’t possible with message(params: MessageParameters). (reply to 56758)

Алексей: There is a problem? You can construct StateInit from code and data, isn't that enough? (reply to 56768)

Алексей: Please don't use ai... (reply to 56770)

&rey: No, as address might not match State for unfreezing in that case. (reply to 56771)

Я̨kov: You're right, it's a typo and it will be quickly resolved (reply to 56762)

Anton: good point  we will adapt to that as well (reply to 56766)

Anton: @pcrafter @gosunov have you had a chance to look at our new gas guidelines for Tact contracts?  Here is the link: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/gas-best-practices.  We would appreciate your feedback and suggestions

&rey: Well not yet... I suppose it's a nice cue to try writing in Tact) (reply to 56776)

&rey: Looks nice. Do you plan to update the Security article to use the global functions too? (reply to 56776)

Я̨kov: Do you mean to use the message() over send() and such? Then, yes — https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/2393 (reply to 56779)

Балтика: I compile the contract code into a HEX string and then already on nodejs predict the address of the contract by passing it unique data. After sending funds to the address the contract is not executed. What am I doing wrong?

Gosha: Hello! Can anyone help me with parsing a payload? Is there an elegant way to parse a payload into a message or a struct?  For example, my payload is a Slice where I store either: struct A { a: Int } struct B { b: Address } How can I determine which struct it is when receiving this payload?  I found Struct.fromSlice in the documentation, but it doesn’t seem to support pattern matching based on the struct type

/B4ckSl4sh\: You can create a payload  struct C {    a: Int?    b: Address? }  This is not what you exactly want, but probably it's better solution for you (reply to 56948)

ILYAR: Sample parsing a payload via TL-B  Create schema.tlb // struct A { a: Int } a a: int256 = A; // struct B { b: Address } b b: MsgAddressInt = B;  Generate code by schema npx @ton-community/tlb-codegen@2.0.0-beta.0 -o schema.ts schema.tlb  Write code sample.ts use types from schema.ts and run npx ts-node sample.ts 42 Ef8zMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM0vF {   bocA: 'te6cckEBAQEAJgAASAYovqEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKu1DVIw=',   bocB: 'te6cckEBAQEAKAAAS25ndrKf5mZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZmZwvzU+eg==' } bocA { kind: 'A', a: 42n } bocB { kind: 'B', b: Ef8zMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzM0vF }  #tlb (reply to 56948)

Gosha: Thx, But I was thinking more about how this code would look on Tact, where the payload contains the transferred message. https://github.com/ston-fi/dex-core/blob/main/contracts/router.func#L80 (reply to 56982)

maksim: In case like this (with jetton transfer notification), you can define receiver as in this, and then use forwardPayload Slice type field to parse it manually. If you are certain in what type you are expecting, you can use Struct.fromSlice, but yeah, it only supports predefined structs at the moment  If you have limited number of possible incoming payloads, you could do something like tagging yourself, like make first 32 bytes define struct type, for example  struct FirstPossiblePayload {  tag: Int as uint32, // e.g tag is 0x1 for this  ... your fields }  message(0x7362d09c) JettonNotification {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     sender: Address;     forwardPayload: Slice as remaining; }  struct SecondPossiblePayload {  tag: Int as uint32, // e.g tag is 0x2 for this  ... your fields }  // in receiver code  let payload = msg.forwardPayload let tag = payload.loadUint(32)  if (tag == 0x1) {  // parse with Struct.fromSlice } // same with other cases (reply to 57007)

Gosha: Thanks, that helped! I'm curious, how does the message receiver in Tact determine what kind of message has arrived? I assume the op code is already "added" there, so maybe it's possible to extract it from the transferred message without adding a new tag field? (reply to 57008)

maksim: Yes, our router does exactly this (parsing incoming message OP) to determine what receiver should accept the message, but we can't use this in case of a few possible payloads. I mean in one receiver, if it's suits your use-case, you can define exact structure of full message, for example:  message(0x7362d09c) JettonNotification {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     sender: Address;     forwardPayload: Int as uint256; // uint instead of remaining if you only want to accept this exact payload }  But if you want to have a few of this, you will have to write separate receivers for them. Not perfect but somewhat similar example is Tact v5 wallet contract compatible with func, check patterns used there (you might need to check v5 tlb to get a grip) (reply to 57009)

Anton: As Maksim said, you can explicitly specify the message opcode, but if you need to access the opcode in your code, you can add a constant like this:   const TakeWalletAddressOpcode: Int = 0xd1735400;  message(TakeWalletAddressOpcode) TakeWalletAddress {     queryId: Int as uint64;     walletAddress: Address;     ownerAddress: Cell?; //It is Maybe ^Address, just encoded it like this }   There is a task to add static fields for message opcodes: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/2230, so you will be able to do it in a simpler way: TakeWalletAddress.opcode (reply to 57009)

Anton: 🎉 Tact v1.6.3 and v1.6.4 are released!  We're back with some quality-of-life improvements! I cannot promise there won't be another patch release before the next big one — that's because we're working on something really enticing in the background and would like you to continue receiving updates in the meantime.  Now, this isn't a dual release per se. It's just that the post for v1.6.3 got lost in the river of time... Kidding! The two patches are simply very connected since we wanted to ensure that v1.6.4 acknowledges the possible gaps in v1.6.3.  Let's unfold the v1.6.3 and v1.6.4 at once:  🛠 Bug fixes  • In the compilation report, TL-B for Address? is not Maybe Address, but plain Address. This is a temporary measure until the Address type is reworked to allow not just the addr_std scheme, but also the addr_none, addr_var and addr_extern.  • Parameter reordering optimization is now only applied to single-parameter asm extension functions, to avoid confusion when performing multiple mutation operations on arguments.  • The postinstall script has been removed from Tact's package.json so that Node.js package managers won't unexpectedly trip on it when you try to upgrade or reinstall the compiler in your projects.  ✍️ Documentation updates  • Deprecated Deployable and FactoryDeployable traits in favor of null message body receive(), with or without a call to the new cashback() function at your discretion.  • ⛽️ Added gas best practices page, go check it out to reduce gas usage of your contracts: Gas best practices.  • 🎁 Enhanced the TypeScript wrappers produced by Tact compiler, and documented how to use the new exit code and opcode records: Interacting with TypeScript wrappers.  • Added missing reference docs and fixed many descriptions and links throughout the standard library.  • Made a significant change to the Reference section: removed the core-common and core-advanced pages, and distributed their contents across other libraries, such as: core-crypto, core-contextstate, core-send, core-gas, and core-addresses.  🧳 Miscellaneous improvements  • Added forceBasechain() and forceWorkchain() functions.  • Added the internalExternalReceiversOutsideMethodsMap config option as part of optimization options to prevent the contracts from being incorrectly recognized by some explorers and user wallets.  • Further decreased gas usage of contracts with some special cases of binary and fallback Slice receivers. This is relevant mainly for Jettons, but other contracts could benefit from this, too.  • The old parser is finally removed. As a user of the compiler, you shouldn't notice a thing, but if something misparses or behaves weirdly in terms of syntax — please notify us in the chat or by opening an issue and providing a minimal reproducible example.  📜 See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.3 and Tact v1.6.4 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  🍲 spinning cat be like: u-ii-tact-i, ou-iii-tact-i ♨️ @tact_kitchen from the @ton_studio (forwarded from Tact Kitchen)

Nyine: 👍

Алексей: Tact developers, do you know about tvm inscruction SDBEGINSQ? I think this instruction can reduce gas consumption almost in every case by several dozens units, and has no drawbacks (maybe).  I rewrote generated func code with it https://pastebin.com/nLHBHcPZ, this saves 96 gas units.  I actually wanted to contribute, but I think it requires pretty heavy changes in code, and I am not sure if it is needed

Anton: wow! looks interesting 🚀  will definitely take a look (reply to 57242)

Балтика: contract Wallet {     id: Int as uint64;          init(id: Int) {         self.id = id;     }          receive() {         cashback(sender());     } }

Балтика: import { Address, beginCell, Cell, toNano } from '@ton/core';  const codeHex = 'xxx-hex-code';  function getWalletAddress(id: number, codeHex: string): Address {     const code = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(codeHex, 'hex'))[0];      const data = beginCell()         .storeUint(id, 64) // id хранится как uint64         .endCell();      const stateInit = beginCell()         .storeBit(0) // No split_depth         .storeBit(0) // No special         .storeBit(1) // Has code         .storeBit(1) // Has data         .storeBit(0) // No library         .storeRef(code)         .storeRef(data)         .endCell();      const hash = stateInit.hash();     const address = new Address(0, hash);     console.log('Generated wallet address:', address);     return address; }

Балтика: What's the problem? I generate addresses based on the received hex string with blueprint build command. Then I expect the contract to be deployed at the first replenishment. What am I doing wrong?

Anton: You are building your data cell manually, you should have used the fromInit function that Tact generates for you.  Since you are using the init function, Tact adds the lazy deployment bit into the data cell.  Your way should work if you switch to using contract parameters introduced in Tact 1.6.0, like this:   contract Wallet(id: Int as uint64) {     receive() {         cashback(sender());     } } (reply to 57248)

Балтика: contract Wallet(id: Int as uint64) {     receive() {         cashback(sender());     } } import { Address } from '@ton/core'; import { Wallet } from '@/build/Wallet/tact_Wallet';  async function getWalletAddress(id: bigint): Promise<Address> {     const wallet = await Wallet.fromInit(id);     return wallet.address; } (reply to 57249)

Балтика: I did as you said but I am not getting the expected behavior. I updated the hex string after compilation and use the wrapper from the build folder. When sending funds (0.1 TON) the contract does not change its status to active.

Балтика: Does it matter if I use bounced or non-bounced addresses?

/B4ckSl4sh\: No (reply to 57253)

/B4ckSl4sh\: how do you actually send funds to the address? (reply to 57252)

Балтика: Tonkeeper (reply to 57255)

Балтика: My plan is to have these contracts serve as a pad between the master wallet and transfer funds in the future. The first replenishment should, as I thought, deploy the contract and send a message to the master wallet about the initial replenishment amount (excluding deployment costs and sending commission)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You should attach stateInit to your message to deploy contract, you don't have this feature in tonkeeper interface, you should deploy your contract by script in prefered language (reply to 57256)

Балтика: What is the point of lazy deployment then? I'm just a newbie 😔

Балтика: My task was to not pay immediately for the deployment of each contract from my wallet and to deploy the contract upon receipt of the first funds. Since a day there may be thousands of users and accordingly thousands of contracts. According to your logic it turns out to be costly.

Я̨kov: To perform some specific action upon deployment and do it just once and never again.  Before contract parameters were introduced in Tact v1.6.0, this one-off function was used primarily to set default values of contract variables (reply to 57259)

Балтика: What is the present value of deploying the contract?

Балтика: I think I got it. The contract address itself does not give anything since it is just an address and the contract code is not in the blockchain. Thank you. So I was just generating a bunch of addresses that had nothing inherently behind them. And when I sent the TON they just stayed there?

Alex: I bumped tact version and one of my test starts to fail.  I have contract A, that receives incoming message, then changes it’s state and sends message to contract B. Then contract B processes message and notifies A. If state of A wasn’t changed on step 1 then notification from B fails.   Previously transaction on the last step was ok, and now it started to fail because of state A.  I have debug logs in my contract, then tells me that state was changed. but getter function tells that state didn’t change.  how to deal  with that?

grachzy: Does anyone have an opensource project with dex / liquidity pool on tact?

Anton: TON Studio is going to work on an open-source DEX but it won’t be ready until Q3 2025 (reply to 57321)

Anton: There is PixelSwap DEX written in Tact, but it is closed-source

Anton: Hmm, interesting the Tact team could help you debug the issue, but we would have to look at the source code most likely (reply to 57317)

Anton: Or you can try produce an MRE: https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example

Vadim: As for this issue I’ve put code snippet on gist https://gist.github.com/Datswishty/7901023d8269743f0a453a2dac5a85e8 (it is not the prettiest code) , importang logs are bellow   console.log     #DEBUG#: File sources/prikol.tact:25:9:     #DEBUG#: dump("Inside JettonTransferNotification1")     #DEBUG#: Inside JettonTransferNotification1     #DEBUG#: File sources/prikol.tact:34:13:     #DEBUG#: dump("Inside if")     #DEBUG#: Inside if     #DEBUG#: File sources/prikol.tact:37:17:     #DEBUG#: dump("Inside if2")     #DEBUG#: Inside if2     #DEBUG#: File sources/prikol.tact:39:17:     #DEBUG#: dump(self.jettonWalletBalance)     #DEBUG#: 100        at SmartContract.runCommon (node_modules/@ton/sandbox/dist/blockchain/SmartContract.js:252:21)    console.log     #DEBUG#: File sources/prikol.tact:57:9:     #DEBUG#: dump("Trying to get wallet amount")     #DEBUG#: Trying to get wallet amount     #DEBUG#: File sources/prikol.tact:58:9:     #DEBUG#: dump(self.jettonWalletBalance)     #DEBUG#: 0        at SmartContract.get (node_modules/@ton/sandbox/dist/blockchain/SmartContract.js:301:21)    console.log     0n        at Object.<anonymous> (tests/prikol.spec.ts:93:17)   FAIL  tests/prikol.spec.ts   Prikol     ✕ should work (341 ms)    ● Prikol › should work      expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality      Expected: 100n     Received: 0n  I am using tact-template with tact-compiler 1.6.4, node 23.9.0, macos, my tsconfig is following -  {     "projects": [         {             "name": "fun",             "path": "./sources/prikol.tact",             "output": "./sources/output",             "mode": "full",             "options": {                 "external": false,                 "debug": true,                 "ipfsAbiGetter": false,                 "interfacesGetter": false,                 "experimental": {                     "inline": false                 }             }         }     ] } (reply to 57659)

Anton: thanks for sharing, could you also share the imports so we can reproduce the issue on our side? (reply to 57663)

Vadim: Sure, here - https://github.com/Datswishty/tmp (reply to 57664)

Anton: got it, thanks  we understand where the problem is and will fix it asap  in the mean time, you can replace the Stoppable trait with a custom implementation for now (it should not reuse the “Contract stopped” string in its `require`s, since this what causes that error due to an error message clash) (reply to 57665)

Vadim: just to clarify , having a custom implementation for Stoppable does not fix the issue with https://t.me/tactlang/57663, I’ve tried it with   import "@stdlib/ownable";  trait Unstoppable with Ownable {          stopped: Bool;     owner: Address;      fun requireNotStopped() {         require(!self.stopped, "Contract definetly not stopped");     }      fun requireStopped() {         require(self.stopped, "Contract for sure is stopped");     }      receive("Stop") {         self.requireOwner();         self.requireNotStopped();         self.stopped = true;         self.reply("Stopped".asComment());     }      get fun stopped(): Bool {         return self.stopped;     } }  and although no error in code wrapper, the other issue still persists (reply to 57666)

Anton: Does it work if you remove the return statement from your JettonTransferNotification receiver at line 46? (reply to 57667)

Vadim: wow, it does work then I remove return on line 46 (reply to 57668)

Vadim: I still want to use return though 😂

Anton: thanks for testing, will fix this in 1.6.5 :)  aiming at the end of this week (reply to 57669)

KTO: How can I verify a smart contract written in tact? I send a file from build (.fc) and get an error

maksim: Send .pkg file (reply to 57746)

maksim: It is also generated by building Tact sources

KTO: Is this the only option on tact? (reply to 57747)

Я̨kov: Verifying a contract means to ensure that your contract's sources correspond to the generated BoC code.  For that reason and some other considerations, Tact compiler produces a .pkg file as one of the compilation artifacts.  Use that .pkg file on verifier.ton.org :)  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#pkg

⚡Mohammed: Hello TON Community,  I'm currently working on a payment management system on the TON network, and it works well with internal payments coming from Web3 wallets that include Jetton data and memo information. I now want to expand the system to support external payments coming from exchanges such as Binance using the TONCENTER library.  My question is:Is there a reliable way to process external payments through the TONCENTER library? What are the best strategies to distinguish these payments (for example, by using the memo address) so that they can be correctly identified and linked to the payment records in my system?  Any advice or practical experiences from the community would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much!

Andrey: Hi all. Is it extension trusted? https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonstudio.vscode-tact  only 264 installs

Oleg: Yes (reply to 57814)

Petr: Hey, this is a new official extension 🙂 (reply to 57814)

Anton: The VS Code extension is currently in the alpha release stage, so please open issues in its repo https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-language-server/issues if something is not working or you have any suggestion

Anton: but it is already pretty powerful and can guide you towards writing better, safer and more gas-efficient contracts

Andrey: Yes, I have already noticed. Thank you very much for making TON convenient for developers! (reply to 57818)

Petr: Stay tuned for the next releases with a formatter that will allow you to write not only efficient but also beautiful code!

LowGas: import "@stdlib/deploy"; import "@stdlib/ownable"; import "./messages.tact";  contract AnyJettonReceive with Ownable, Deployable {     owner: Address;     count: Int = 0;      init(owner: Address) {         self.owner = owner;     }      receive(msg: JettonTransferNotification) {         self.count += 1;     }      get fun get_count(): Int {         return self.count;     } }  Hi devs, who knows, why this receive message doesn’t work, I was sent Jetton assets to contract address, but count= 0

Андрей: Can you please share Address of this contract by text? (reply to 57834)

Андрей: Can you share msg: JettonTransferNotification too? Seems like problem right here

LowGas: message(0x7362d09c) JettonTransferNotification {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     sender: Address;     forwardPayload: Slice as remaining; }

Андрей: Oh, just never mind, when you transfer NOT you transfer only 0.000000001 TON, that is so small to execute contract, you need to transfer at least 0.001 TON ( may be more, just suggestion )

LowGas: Thanks, can I use gas from the contract balance? Because I need to receive Jetton transfer from example wallet (Tonkeeper, MyTonWallet e.t.c) (reply to 57841)

Андрей: Unfortunately no, you can read more in https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#compute-phase-skipped

Андрей: Usually services use ton connect to resolve this situations

LowGas: But how I can to change this value, because initiator is jetton_wallet, we can change params only in Jetton Transfer 0x0f8a7ea5 (reply to 57841)

Dmitry: Hi!  I come from the Ethereum world and there are some things I find hard to understand about Tact.  Suppose I have a receiver that sends some Jettons and then emits a success event.  How can I make sure that the JettonTransfer actually completed before I emit the event?

maksim: Since Ton is asynchronous, the only way to implement your example is to chain transactions as return codes, and emit event only on incoming successful next chain message  For this, you have JettonTransferNotification message in jettons TEP  Some small real world example of this semantic could be found here, however this shows only the end of the "transaction chain", the success check (reply to 57900)

maksim: Basically, you cannot know if send or message functions and their results (out messages) would be successful when you call them, you can only know the result if the receiving contract somehow confirms it

Dmitry: Do I understand correctly that I should set the address of my contract in responseDestination in the JettonTransfer structure, and then make a JettonNotification handler in which I will emit an event about a successful operation for my backend?

/B4ckSl4sh\: No, JettonNotify is only for new  Jettons owner (reply to 57904)

&rey: *make an Excesses handler. (reply to 57904)

&rey: Though you will have no guarantee that it was your transfer which triggered that, EVEN if you check that message was sent from destination's jetton wallet.

Pedro: Tonkeeper is able to tell if a txn will succeed or not before execution. If you want to know about the possible txn outcome without the user executing it, perhaps you need to wrap your logic and make it an 'external' func to be called via front-end/tonkeeper.

Pedro: . (reply to 57904)

&rey: That would work if frontend needed to know about operation success. But what if contract needs? (reply to 57909)

Pedro: Why you can't see the output of a func call in the contract?

Dmitry: Because it's not EVM 😄 (reply to 57912)

Dan: Guys, I'm using web ton ide. And if I deploy and test locally there is no issue with read calls from ide. But in testnet I've got a lotta issue with types or returning objects. Has anybody met this before?

Oleg: Can you provide some examples? (reply to 57917)

Dan: basically I've got two issues. One is that some functions return undefined but shouldn't  Unsupported stack item type: undefined 3:12:46 PM   and other issue that objects returned in base64 and not decoded  {     "type": "base64",     "value": "te6cckEBCAEAfQACA9AIAQMBASACACsAAAAAanf33gAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAQEgBAE7AAAAAWg1+oAAAAABAAAAACAvrwgAIC+vCAQAAAAKBQID0AgGBgEBIAcAVAAAAAGAHQkt0efdwgA/gl5maURaXq/sn8tuEEn26BEUKsxlJ7kkAvrwgEI7zUk="   }  functions that return undefined on testnet but work fine locally in the same scenario:      // Total pending funds by user     get fun getPendingFunds(user: Address): Int? {         return self.pendingFunds.get(user);     }      // Get specific events     get fun getEventById(id: Int): Event? {         return self.events.get(id);     } (reply to 57918)

ed: cannot reproduce. tested with tact-lang 1.6.4 -- upgrading only code everything works as expected, same as before. cell underflow does occur if setData with a different contract's data structure is set, however, there is a workaround of manually handling the data changes and providing reserved cell at contract's deployment (reply to 57572)

Amor: Thanks (reply to 57929)

Amor: Can you please give me docs  providing reserved cell at contract's deployment? (reply to 57929)

ed: define the persistent state variable as a Cell. then parse-update-modify it however you want, update its structure etc and persist it on chain, essentially like you would do it in func. reference: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-cells/ (reply to 57933)

Amor: Thank

Andrey: Hello everyone! I encountered a problem when updating a contract that has a child contract. If the contract does not have imported child contracts, then the method specified in the documentation works correctly. But if there are child contracts, then after the update everything breaks. I came up with a workaround - I create a child contract date as on funC and write the code in the cell. With this approach, nothing breaks. Is this how it should be or am I mistaken somewhere? Attaching the code for reproduce https://github.com/apashintsev/TactUpgrade

/B4ckSl4sh\: Hmmmmmmm, I think I understood why you get the problem (reply to 57951)

/B4ckSl4sh\: We will try to fix this in next update, what you can try is to make circulliar contract dependencies.  (quite ugly workaround, but still) (Wait for example, I will show) (reply to 57951)

/B4ckSl4sh\: contract A {     number: Int as uint32 = 0; // Different numbers to get different StateInit      receive() {      }      get fun getNext(): StateInit {         return initOf B();     } } contract B {     number: Int as uint32 = 1; // Different numbers to get different StateInit      receive() {      }      get fun getNext(): StateInit {         return initOf A();     } }   Adding this two contracts in your file should help (reply to 57951)

Andrey: It looks like gas expensive, is not it?

Andrey: Child contract will store code of parent and parent will store code of child

/B4ckSl4sh\: You don't need to use this contracts (reply to 57955)

/B4ckSl4sh\: They will just create circular dependencies, and Tact will fallback to different child contract storage (reply to 57957)

/B4ckSl4sh\: That should be compatible with SETCODE (reply to 57958)

saqib: I'm stuck on this

saqib: Many jetton wallets are not supporting this forward to amount

saqib: Is there any other workaround?

saqib: I'm doing transactions with USDT for now and there is no so many solutions available to try.

saqib: Users mostly have wallets ton chain support and according to docs they need to send forward a ton amount and in the UI of wallets it's not even supported.

saqib: Stuck from 24 hours 😭😭😭

Андрей: Usually services using ton connect to custom forward ton amount

saqib: i already mentioned this....

saqib: but ser, i'm trying this in custom smart contract where user will bet $0.1 - $5 for a room using USDT. (reply to 58136)

saqib: I'm new to this chain also, coming from rust and evm chains

saqib: what is this language? (reply to 58139)

Amor: typescript (reply to 58141)

saqib: can i get docs about this? as tact is not supporting. I thought it's func. (reply to 58142)

Андрей: https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/frameworks/web (reply to 58146)

saqib: This makes sense now, but the problem again is the contract, where I need to lock the amount of bets in the contract, and after the game ends, I need to transfer it back to the winners. Just this thing is left only. (reply to 58151)

Андрей: Firstly you need to understand how jettons work  https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/jettons (reply to 58152)

saqib: yes ser (reply to 58153)

Amor: Contract can't auto send back. You must call it and trigger it send (reply to 58152)

saqib: see here it's also mentioned about this forward_ton_amount but the user wallet don't have this thing and i need to initiate custom transction somehow here?

saqib: yes sir but firstly the tokens must come in the contract! (reply to 58155)

saqib: Using TonConnect, this will be resolved. ? (reply to 58156)

Amor: No. U must custom (reply to 58158)

Amor: if you send Jetton with tonConnect default. It send foward_ton_amount 0.000000001. Your contract receive Jetton but JettonTransferNotification compute-phase-skipped (no excute code in receive(msg: JettonTransferNotification) ) (reply to 58158)

saqib: yes, that's what happening with me at the moment using tonkeeper testnet then what's the workaround here? (reply to 58160)

saqib: and i already implemented this: receive(msg: JettonTransferNotification)

saqib: this (reply to 58139)

Amor: It call contract in your web or Dapp (reply to 58163)

saqib: ooh

Slava: @AntonTrunov that's what I was talking about :)  When the message is sent with this poorly named flag (+1) It won't pay for GAS on the destination contract. It will only pay the forwarding fees. And if you would set the value to zero the destination contract won't be even executed due to the lack of gas.  When sending a message you should always make sure that it carries enough value to pay for the gas and any further forwarding that needs to be done in your execution chain. (reply to 58106)

/B4ckSl4sh\: And that is a reason why it is renamed to SendPayFwdFeesSeparately (reply to 58174)

Anton: Yep, added a new constant and deprecated the old one as you suggested :) (reply to 58174)

Hello, World: Hello!  Can you recommend templates code for jetton, nft to develop on top of them smart-contracts fast?  I found out a project: "tonion-contracts" and want to choose it to not reinvent the wheel, but maybe you can share more code templates that better than this one?

Anton: 🎉 Tact v1.6.5 is released!  Back with another round of refinements! While we're working on many exciting things in the background, we're committed to fixing every bug that the community might discover so that Tact can provide a flawless developer experience.  Furthermore, we now actively employ AI and large language model (LLM) fuzzing techniques, such as documentation-driven approaches where LLMs are given only the Tact language documentation and access to the compiler. Then, LLM agents generate potentially problematic code snippets, compile them, and analyze results. They further iterate and provide new, interesting bug reports — resolving those makes both Tact compiler and Tact documentation better at the same time!  Check out this awesome article from one of the team members to learn more: Documentation-Driven Compiler Fuzzing with Large Language Models.  And now, let's see what's new in Tact v1.6.5, starting with the most prominent part of this patch release:  🛠 Bug fixes  • Ternary operator ?: now correctly works with structs and null values • New parser now properly handles the code that wasn't completed at the end of the file • The error for assembly functions and the get attribute is now correctly shown • Now, when you call the dump() function with an argument of the unsupported StringBuilder type, the error will always be shown even if the debug mode is disabled • Improper whitespace between the operator and the equals sign is no longer allowed • The &&= and ||= augmented assignment operators are now properly short-circuited • Get methods now can return an optional contract state • The Struct.fromSlice(), Message.fromSlice(), and similar functions now work properly if the slice has been parsed entirely and the  last field of the struct had the serialization annotation as remaining • The wildcard symbol _ is prohibited for struct and message struct fields, function names, contract, and trait names • The contract's state is now properly saved on early return statements in the receiver functions  🧳 Miscellaneous improvements  • Whenever you access context().sender, it now calls the sender() function instead to optimize the gas usage • The internalExternalReceiversOutsideMethodsMap option and its respective receiver order optimization were reworked to ensure compatibility with explorers and user wallets • The SendPayGasSeparately constant was deprecated in favor of SendPayFwdFeesSeparately — they're functionally identical, but the latter better expresses the intent and action that this optional flag makes when sending messages • The Stoppable trait now throws the exit code 133 instead of the exit code generated by the require() function from the "Contract stopped" message  📜 See the full release notes for Tact v1.6.5 📥 And upgrade Tact in your projects  LLMs are great, but we value our community no less. It's great being around a bunch of talented, passionate, and bright engineers who make a future of safe and scalable ⚡️ Tact smart contracts on TON possible for everyone. Thank you for everything you do and for the feedback you give!  A special shoutout goes to the RSquad team @rsquadlife for their early adoption of Tact features, thoughtful suggestions, and bug reports. If punk were code, they'd be its maintainers 🤘  🍲 ghibli deez bugs ♨️ @tact_kitchen from the @ton_studio (forwarded from Tact Kitchen)

Hello, World: It would be awesome if so.  I'm currently researching ton and how to code in tact, but I faced some problems that no latest and safe boilerplates such as jetton and nft implementation in tact, also how to interact with them properly (for instance: how to handle nft receiving to the smart contract address and if in the last message is error, send nft back to user or something like that) (reply to 57571)

Hello, World: By now, there's no clear examples how to work with asynchronous model with minimal pain. Hope it will become much much better in the future.

Hello, World: And if the error occurs need to handle it via bounced function, but can it be more easy way to not think about what will happen, just to not change the state if the got error.  Or it's not possible coz of TVM architecture?

saqib: Hey devs, How should I get TESTNET USDT tokens? I already have Ton Coins but i need usdt one

saqib: Bro, why are there no proper docs? Now, where should I get the JettonWallet code? It's asking for a file.

saqib: 😥😥

&rey: Btw is it planned to replace docs' way of getting JW address with the fully general one via get-methods?

Hello, World: But how it can calculated for every jetton, for swap functionality for example? (reply to 58334)

/B4ckSl4sh\: ? I did not get you (reply to 58335)

Hello, World: In production for example can be different versions of jettons (reply to 58336)

Hello, World: I mean I do not write the code for that jettons

Hello, World: And do not know their data, only address

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yeah, and you will need code and data of for each one (reply to 58337)

/B4ckSl4sh\: You can get that offchain (reply to 58339)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Even in tonviewer for example (reply to 58341)

Hello, World: But dex protocols for example maybe do it via on chain contract deployer or I'm not right? (reply to 58341)

Hello, World: "get fun" construction only for off-chain data obtaining? But can I somehow send a message to another contract to get data from get fun? Or another contract should implement not get fun, but receiver for this purpose?

Hello, World: Hello!  If I understood it right for now no way to validate jetton / nft on-chain that jetton has master wallet that I need, as also as NFT item can't be validated that from NFT collection that I need?  I don't found a messages to send from jetton master key by its address to verify that jetton wallet is true its wallet, and I can get nft static data (and collection address), but collection smart-contract has no on-chain message to verify that NFT item is really from right collection that I needed to handle when receive to my smart-contract?

Anton: interesting, thanks for catching this, as a workaround you can adjust the amount of toncoin in the settings like so (reply to 58742)

Sol: Came across an interesting situation yesterday: a project launched a smart contract on TON, but due to a small mistake, they lost part of their funds. This isn’t the first time I’ve seen a coding error cost more than the development itself.  Smart contracts are powerful, but without a proper approach, they can cause more problems than benefits. I’ve noticed that many projects ignore audits and fail to plan the logic properly.  Has anyone here faced similar issues?

Hello, World: I through I find a way to validate NFT on-chain and it works, but now I understood that someone else can write a custom nft contract to look like another nft collection.  Code from tact docs: inline fun calculateNFTAddress(index: Int, collectionAddress: Address, nftCode: Cell): Address {     let initData = NFTItemInitData{         index,         collectionAddress,     };      return contractAddress(StateInit{code: nftCode, data: initData.toCell()}); }    My code for on-chain nft check: receive(msg: OwnershipAssigned) {         let forward_payload: Cell = msg.forward_payload.asCell().beginParse().loadRef();          let nft_index: Int = forward_payload.beginParse().loadUint(64);         let nft_code: Cell = forward_payload.beginParse().loadRef();          let calculated_address: Address = calculateNFTAddress(nft_index, self.NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS, nft_code);          let string_builder: StringBuilder = beginComment();         if(calculated_address == sender()) {             string_builder.append("NFT is correct! ");         } else {             string_builder.append("ERROR NFT!");         }         string_builder.append(nft_index.toString());         string_builder.append(" ");         string_builder.append(calculated_address.toString()); ................. }  It works fine, but I guess if someone will write a custom item contract that will have the same init as passed via payload forward, so my contract will check it and say that nft is correct, but it's not the correct one!

Hello, World: So, now I have no idea how to really check (on-chain) nft item that this is the item from collection I need, not from another collection.

Hello, World: Only can imagine to pass NFT item code when init my smart-contract, because when I did my tests with getgems test version, all my nft had the same smart-contract code

Андрей: You need to store nft code and collection address in your contract, and just forward index, and by index calculate address   receive(msg: OwnershipAssigned) {         let forward_payload: Cell = msg.forward_payload.asCell().beginParse().loadRef();          let nft_index: Int = forward_payload.beginParse().loadUint(64);          let calculated_address: Address = calculateNFTAddress(nft_index, self.NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS, self.NFT_ITEM_CODE);          let string_builder: StringBuilder = beginComment();         if(calculated_address == sender()) {             string_builder.append("NFT is correct! ");         } else {             string_builder.append("ERROR NFT!");         }         string_builder.append(nft_index.toString());         string_builder.append(" ");         string_builder.append(calculated_address.toString()); ................. }  btw you can use structures in messages, it helps you not have to do the parsing yourself (reply to 58910)

Hello, World: Hi!  If I send a message from my smart-contract to another and got bounced, so I need in my smart contract write bounced function with sent message?  For example: Jetton Transfer -> My Smart Contract (jetton transfer handler receiver) -> Transfer -> Another Smart Contract (Got transfer message but throw bounced) -> My smart contract again So, I need to create bounced<Transfer> receiver?

Hello, World: I mean: a type of bounced message has to be the same type of message that I sent to another contract.  If I sent Transfer message and then got bounced I should handle it as a bounced <Transfer>?

T.E.S: Do you have any solutions? (reply to 59271)

&rey: You'll need a separate contract that counts incoming messages and forwards everything when last one arrives. (reply to 59270)

ShhhToshi: I have a coin show unverified underneath it on tonkeeper wallet.. anyone know why..?

T.E.S: Yes, it's my contract, so I want to map each excess to a new step. (reply to 59273)

T.E.S: const OP_CODE_EXCESS_JETTON: Int = 0xd53276db;  receive(msg: Slice) {         acceptMessage();         // require(msg.bits() >= 32, "Message too short for opcode");          if (msg.bits() >= 32) {             let op: Int = msg.loadUint(32); // Load opCode từ body             if (op == OP_CODE_EXCESS_JETTON) {                 // let value_refun = context().value - ton("0.005");                 // let fee_refun = ton("0.005");                 let msgValue = context().value;                 self.pending_user_fee.value += msgValue;                 emit("OP_CODE_EXCESS_JETTON".asComment());                 emit(msgValue.toString().asComment());             }         } else {             emit("Thank".asComment());         }     }  it's code hook excess

T.E.S: so i don't solutions map all excess

&rey: // initialize skip_transfers=jetton_excess_count-1 receive(msg: Excess) {     if (self.skip_transfers > 0) {         self.skip_transfers -= 1;     } else {         send(..., mode: SendRemainingBalance ...)     } } (reply to 59277)

&rey: In a separate contract.

T.E.S: your solutions only handle step excess end, don't map all excess to new step (reply to 59279)

&rey: I claim this solution matches what you drew, sending all TON to A in one tx, exactly. (reply to 59282)

Terry: it's default, for verify, pls push your jetton infomation to ton assets github repo (reply to 59275)

&rey: Could you draw what my solution does in your opinion? (reply to 59282)

T.E.S: thanks, i control total excess after handle step end (reply to 59283)

T.E.S: i want return remaining  value for user (reply to 59285)

&rey: At this step I cannot understand your sentences at all. (reply to 59286)

ShhhToshi: Hey is there any tonviewer team here ?

Ansar: hi,  i am new to tact language from where i can learn that from scratch , thank you

/B4ckSl4sh\: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/learn-tact-in-y-minutes/ (reply to 59355)

Hello, World: Hi, there!)  According to tact docs there's 224 bits on bounced event: Currently, bounced messages in TON have only 224 usable data bits in the message body and don’t have any references.     But I guess it's not enough to store even one Address type on bounced message. So, if smart-contract sent jettons or nft, there's no possible check for why recipient of that asset.  So, the question here is that query_id solves the problem? I'm thinking about create a map in my smart-contract that will hold info about query_id and if something is going wrong in bounced message I can retrieve an address of sender and other useful data.

/B4ckSl4sh\: Yeah, in some cases that is good approach. But be careful about maximum map capacity (reply to 59368)

Hello, World: Thanks, I will try this approach out (reply to 59369)

&rey: Don't trust user-passed query IDs because user can send two messages with the same. Instead, use curLt() for outgoing bounceables. (reply to 59368)

Hello, World: Yeah, I will generate a pseudo-random value when sent a message inside the smart-contract (reply to 59378)

&rey: curLt() is better since it is guaranteed to be unique on each transaction within one contract. (reply to 59379)

Я̨kov: It's an extension (extends), but not an extension mutation (extends mutates) function. Hence, it cannot mutate the value.  Either assign the x.asmInc() back to x somewhere (x = x.asmInc()), or add a mutates attribute and remove the return type:  asm extends mutates fun asmIncMut(self: Int) { INC }  // ... let x = 0; x.asmIncMut(); // x is now 1 (reply to 59604)

Алексей: I am wondering why Tact doesn't support default fields value in contract parameters? I am tending to use init approach just because I can have defaults. Would be cool if I could write like this   contract Test(     x: Int as uint64,     y: Bool = false, ) {     receive() { cashback(sender()); } }

Я̨kov: We have some ideas how that could be done, including enhancements on the TypeScript wrappers side.  As of now, you can use structs to represent the contract's state. Here's how:  struct ContractState {     field1: Int as uint32 = 0;     field2: Bool = false;     // you can add or remove fields here,     // and all fields of this struct     // would constitute the contract's data }  contract Showcase(     state: ContractState, ) {} (reply to 59805)

Anton: this can only affect the TS wrappers, and onchain deployments by a parent contract  so, yeah, the example by @novusnota42 is good and can be extended like so:   contract ShowcaseParent() {     receive() {         deploy(DeployParameters {             value: 0,             mode: SendRemainingValue,             body: Msg { queryId: 42 }.toCell(),             init: initOf Showcase(ContractState {}),         });     } } (reply to 59805)

sape: How do I get the hexadecimal value not decimal value of the sha256 function?

sape: The documentation does not say anything except it returning an Int

Anton: If possible, you should not do anything with strings in your contract (reply to 59880)

sape: I ended up creating a hex version of the decimal but it is not the right thing to do

sape: Is there a limitation for strings? (reply to 59882)

Anton: it’s inefficient in terms of gas

Anton: you should be able to move all string processing into your backend/frontend (reply to 59883)

Yoviar▪️: isn't unload used for reload? (reply to 59892)

sape: Reloads and closing tabs

Yoviar▪️: Yes, what I want is when the user exit the browser, that's why I use session storage, when reloading or switching tabs, I want the wallet to stay connected to the website.

sape: Seems like you have the closest thing to detecting a close then

sape: Unless the browser itself triggers an event when closing you're limited to JS capabilities

Yoviar▪️: Yes that's right, I'm copying the feature on the initia website, when the user exits the browser the wallet automatically disconnects, maybe I should implement a jwt token

Yoviar▪️: so that there is no need to disconnect when the user closes the browser

sape: This would make it better for the user to be honest (reply to 59898)

kragle: Hey guys, probably a very simple question: does anybody know how to get a size of a String literal or String builder in Tact? I'm writing a validation of message input to make sure the payload doesn't exceed N characters. Thanks in advance!

Yoviar▪️: receive(msg: WithdrawCampaign){         self.requireOwner();         require(self.campaigns.exists(msg.id), "campaign not found");          let campaign = self.campaigns.get(msg.id);         let balance = myBalance();          require(campaign!!.balance >= msg.amount, "insufficient balance");         require(balance > msg.amount, "insufficient balance");          send(SendParameters{             to: self.owner,              value: msg.amount,              mode: 0,             bounce: true,         });          require(balance > myBalance(), "failed withdraw campaign");          self.campaigns.set(msg.id, Campaign{             id: msg.id,             name: campaign!!.name,             balance: campaign!!.balance - msg.amount,         });     }  I have a function like this for withdraw balance, and now I'm confused, why require after send can't run properly? is there a solution?

Евгений: Caution  Beware that all message-sending functions of Tact can change the actual balance of the contract, but they won’t update the value returned by this function. (reply to 60191)

Slava: You should thoroughly understand how the Blockchain works before writing the code. Writing the code without knowing the principles is very dangerous. (reply to 60191)

Алексей: Is it possible to write extending mutating function on map?

Алексей: I see this stuff in stubs.tact  extends mutates fun set(self: map<K, V>, key: K, val: V);  But when I try  extends mutates fun mySet(self: map<Address, Bool>, k: Address)  I get this error Extend functions must have a reference type as the first parameter

Anton: A workaround for now would be to wrap your map into a struct:   struct CustomMap {     m: map<Int as uint32, Bool> }  extends mutates fun foo(self: CustomMap) {     self.m.set(0, true);     self.m.set(1, true); }   This will be supported natively in one of the next upcoming Tact releases (reply to 60283)

Pavel: Hello everyone, could you please advise how to identify the token I created on minter ton org  in the contract.

Pavel: fun calculateJettonWalletAddress(     ownerAddress: Address,     jettonMasterAddress: Address,     jettonWalletCode: Cell ): Address { If I understand correctly:  ownerAddress refers to the contract address (myAddress())  jettonMasterAddress is the address of the Jetton Minter contract from minter ton org  Question: Where can I obtain the jettonWalletCode value? Is this typically predefined in the TACT standard libraries, or should it be retrieved from the minter contract?

maksim: If you are wondering about accepting this token inside your contract or calculating jetton wallet addresses based on the minter address, you can check this example from our cookbook

Pavel: Thanks! (reply to 60291)

maksim: You can retrieve it from the explorers in case of already existing jettons, or directly from Tact-generated wrappers in case of Tact-Jetton  Second case is covered in the link above (reply to 60290)

Potok: Can you tell me how to check for an entry in slice and, if not, add this entry to slice? Something like that: addressHash  = context().sender.aslice().hash(); s: Slice = beginCell().endCell().beginParse().loadBits(2048); if (s.getBit(addressHash)) {             throw();         } s.setBit(addressHash, true);

......: how can we verify that a same address can't interact with a contract twice without using map because they are too costly if address are in millions?

maksim: Apply same concept as from web2 point of view - sharding (reply to 60428)

......: votedShard: map<Int as uint32, map<Address, Bool>>; does tact doesn't have structure like this?

Я̨kov: You can make nested maps through structs as values, but it'll be quite expensive.  The idea of sharding is that you have a parent contract which deploys many child contracts — one per each user (user's wallet). Then, the parent and child contracts exchange messages to update each others states when needed, with all necessary checks upfront.  For an example, see the Jetton (token) implementation, where Minter is the parent contract and Wallet is the child: https://github.com/tact-lang/defi-cookbook/tree/main/jettons/impl/basic (reply to 60432)

Я̨kov: Although message() is more effective than send(), they both use 500 gas or more simply due to the nature of sending messages on TON and the required logic underneath.

Fedor: Hi, I came across a strange behavior with nativeReserve function. I have the following code:  receive () {  dump ("do reserve and cashback");  dump (myBalance());  nativeReserve (1_000, 0);  cashback(sender)); }   My expectation is that I would reserve 1k nanoton in my smart contract and return the rest to the issuer.   I wrote a test where I send an empty message with 1 ton to this contract. I expect that the contract balance would be 1_000 nanoton, but somehow in my tests the cashback() doesn't seem to return any funds to the sender

Fedor: Here is the logs of my test

Fedor: I am failing to understand what I am doing wrong here, because based on the docs it does sound like nativeReserve is intended to be used in conjunction with cashback()

Salvatore: Same here. Did literally exact same thing, tried to play with mode values, yet didn’t work for me. Will try again soon, if I could find the solution I’ll tell you, if nobody answers (reply to 60853)

Salvatore: This got me curious… 🤔 Unsuccessfully tried to find more information about nativeReserve or some prod code examples

&rey: Please check /book/send/#outbound-message-processing in Tact docs. (reply to 60853)

X$💰🍀🇺🇦: 😌😊 (reply to 60864)

Fedor: Do I miss something specific? I did read that section and it does explain that it is tricky to correctly send 2 messages working with the balance, but that at the end it mention that it is encouraged to use nativeReserve and then return the remaining balance using send (cashback is more user friendly wrapper over send) (reply to 60860)

&rey: cashback uses SendRemainingValue under the hood. (reply to 60866)

Igor: Hi! I have function receive(msg: Message) {   self.counter += 1;   //commit();   require(msg.amount < 10, "amount < 10 required");   //...code here  } In current implementation counter is rolled back when require "fails", but I want to persist counter change on every message. How to achieve this? I see commit() function in the doc, but looks like it does something different...

Евгений: commit should preserve storage even if error occured (reply to 60984)

Евгений: Another way I see, is that you can send back message with error code, instead of throwing error in compute phase

Igor: It doesn't save self.counter even with commit(). I dump it every time and it increments only it there was no error... (reply to 60986)

Igor: Hm, seems like possible solution How to send message with exit code? (reply to 60987)

Евгений: hm I have no idea then, commit worked for me

Евгений: just normal message using 'send' or 'message' functions (reply to 60989)

Евгений: that's what I mean

Евгений: but receiver should know and parse that message

Евгений: that's not standard

Igor: Hm, could you please then send some example with commit if it works for you? I think that I'm wrong in some really tiny detail

Алексей: I guess it's kind of tact issue, because before the commit you need to manually set C4 register and the tact does it for you automatically but only at the end and after commit (reply to 60988)

DeFi Maestro: What is the issue? (reply to 60636)

Anton: you can check how it’s done in our benchmarks:  https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/src/benchmarks/contracts/wallet-v4.tact#L119-L120  This is a known issue, btw. https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/2496 (reply to 60995)

Алексей: Don't know if it is known issue   message Hello {     name: String }  contract Test {     receive() {         message(MessageParameters{             to: sender(),             value: 0,             mode: SendRemainingValue,             body: Hello.toCell(),         });     } }   There is syntax error (maybe not?), but the compiler doesn't tell it in a nice way, only fails at a func stage

Ilia: Is there any documentation page that clearly explains how map is serialised and stored and how much memory in contract storage it takes?

Я̨kov: Not sure about the coverage or clarity of it, but there's an in-depth section on maps in TON Docs: https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-types#hashmap (reply to 61022)

Mykola: Question about task 4:  The `ProposalMaster` contract should have a top-up empty message receiver that increases the contract balance to 0.01 TON each time it is invoked. What should it do when balance is already larger?

Mykola: The contract should accept all the funds if the incoming message carries a smaller TON amount. Does it mean that smaller messages = smaller than 0.01TON ?

The await waiter(); part is where I'm interested in. But I don't understand how to bring it to my code which uses the latest version of @ton/ton package (reply to 61196)

/B4ckSl4sh\: Just save current seqno, send transaction and then wait for seqno to change (reply to 61324)

A: How to wait for seqno to change? I tried to rewrite the waitForSeqno function available here. But I'm totally confused. the Wallet type is not available in @ton/ton package. Instead there is WalletContractV4. Here is my code: export async function waitForSeqno(provider: ContractProvider, wallet: WalletContractV4) {   const seqnoBefore = await wallet.getSeqno(provider);    return async () => {     for (let attempt = 0; attempt < 25; attempt++) {       await sleep(3000);       const seqnoAfter = await wallet.getSeqno(provider);       if (seqnoAfter > seqnoBefore) return;     }     throw new Error("Timeout");   }; }  But I don't understand how to use it in my sendTransfer function: const client = useTonClient(); const { sender, walletAddress } = useTonConnect(); sendTransfer: async (amount: string | number) => {             const forwardTonAmount = toNano("0.05");             const forwardPayload = beginCell().storeUint(0, 1).endCell().asSlice();             const packedMessage = beginCell().store(                 storeJettonTransfer({                     $$type: "JettonTransfer",                     queryId: BigInt(Date.now()),                     amount: toNano(amount),                     destination: Address.parse(SOME_ADDRESS),                     responseDestination: sender.address!,                     customPayload: null,                     forwardTonAmount,                     forwardPayload                 })             ).endCell();              await sender.send({                 value: toNano("0.1"),                 to: contract.address!,                 bounce: true,                 body: packedMessage             });         } (reply to 61325)
