Spetsnaz: Anyway to debug these kind of error messages in Tact:  Func compilation error: /Users/path/build/ContractMaster/tact_ContractTransfer.code.fc:128:1: error: previous function return type ((slice, int, int, int, int, int, slice, (cell, int, int), int, int, cell, int, int, int, slice, int), int) cannot be unified with implicit end-of-block return type (): cannot unify type () with ((slice, int, int, int, int, int, slice, (cell, int, int), int, int, cell, int, int, int, slice, int), int)   }  I can't find the file mentioned in the error, so I can't read the code in there understand what it is about. There's also no indication about the function name or any kind of clue about the problematic part of the contract

Spetsnaz: Found the solution. For those who encounter a similar issue, this may happen when you have a getter function that defines a return type but does not actually return stuff.  Not easy to spot, IDE won't highlight and Tact too won't show an error (reply to 22350)

encs: Hey guys, I m using this method trying to get received JETTONS to my contract and add them to pools

encs: receive(msg: TokenNotification) {         self.receivedTokens = msg.amount;         dump(msg.amount);     }

encs: I don't get any notification, any idea?

encs: @spetsnaz116

encs: message(0x7362d09c) TokenNotification {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     from: Address;     forward_payload: Slice as remaining; // Comment Text message when Transfer the jetton  }

encs: this is the message

encs: @Gusarich

Spetsnaz: What do you mean receiving TonkenNotification? From where? (reply to 22389)

encs: When I sent a Jetton to my contract from my wallet, I want to get the notification on my contract, like receiving it and add it to a map

encs: if I use receive(){} normally, I can only get the TON that I send to the contract, but not the jettons

encs: If I use this function to get the TON received it works, but if I send jettons it doesn't work (reply to 22399)

encs: receive() {         let ctx: Context = context();         let depositsLet: Deposits = Deposits{sender: ctx.sender, amount: ctx.value};         self.deposits.set(self.depositsLength, depositsLet);         self.depositsLength = self.depositsLength + 1;          //dump(msg.amount);     }

Spetsnaz: Jettons on TON need their own wallet. It‚Äôs not EVM. Logic as follow: WalletA owns JettonA via WalletAA (which is created automatically)  When you send to FooContract, which is your  contract, JettonA creates a JettonA wallet (new contract) that has as owner FooContract. So your contract never really stores Jettons, it‚Äôs being assigned new wallets for their respective jettons (reply to 22401)

Spetsnaz: If you look at the standard Jetton wallet, you‚Äôll see that it initializes a new contract for each address

Spetsnaz: I faced this issue where I can‚Äôt check the Jetton balance of a wallet. You‚Äôll need to use apis to get that

encs: Oh shit

encs: So I can't view if a user sends to my contract jettons

Spetsnaz: Nope. Unless you use special Jetton wallets that you create which communicate with FooContract directly. The other way around is to use an API and update the balance on your contract using this api. You can look at tonapi.io (reply to 22412)

encs: Understood! Thanks very much

encs: is there any farming project on ton? (reply to 22413)

encs: https://github.com/delab-team/contracts/tree/main/jetton-pool

Haz: Hi

Haz: Is there anybody here who can help me with tact tests?  PROBLEM: jetton is minted during deployment in init function. When I check deployer balance after minting I have 0, don't know why. On testnet it works, in test not, why?

Haz: Is it now allowed to paste link to code here? I don't know why my message is removed

Spetsnaz: I didn't run tests yet, working on them, but I think you can use blockchain.treasury with the 2nd argument containing the balance (reply to 22445)

Spetsnaz: Something like this maybe, but I didn't try yet

Haz: Thanks, but my problem is not a TON balance but Jetton balance on deployer address (reply to 22451)

Haz: Do you know how to paste link to code here?

Spetsnaz: You can paste if it's not too much (reply to 22455)

Haz: I cant, it is removed automatycally

Haz: even github gist...

Truong: let publicKey = beginCell().storeBuffer(keypair.publicKey).endCell().beginParse().loadUintBig(256); (reply to 22597)

Spetsnaz: I guess for this one, you'll just need to test that the notification is sent in the transactions object (reply to 22581)

Spetsnaz: I couldn't find any documentation on how to take fees from the context value. For example, the contract will charge 1 TON for a certain service.  - SendRemainingValue will just return all the tons minus the blockchain fees - Using send() means that it's going to essentially "refund" in a different message, so the person would "receive" Tons as if it's a new transaction to them  Anyway to do this without option 2, where we just deduct the 1 TON from the value and SendRemainingValue?

cypherpunksO1: Hi)

cypherpunksO1: Does anyone know what Cell is for? I don't really understand it, and there is very little documentation....

Yakitori: Cell is the basic data structure for TON (reply to 22676)

Yakitori: You can store 1024 bits in it

cypherpunksO1: Roughly speaking, it's a dictionary?

Yakitori: https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/cells  No, it's more like a 1024 bit slot where you can put whatever you want, and that can be linked. (reply to 22679)

cypherpunksO1: But in tact, you can arrange the dictionaries there, right?

Yakitori: Yes - but bear in mind that making dict with Cells doesn't scale, as you will be limited by its size (reply to 22681)

Yakitori: The best way is to use the blockchain as a dict and deploy a specific contract for each key-value pair

cypherpunksO1: Thanks, I'm new to writing smart contracts and appreciate any help I can get

Yakitori: (if you don't know the bounds of your dict)

Yakitori: Sure! I'm learning too, so let's help each others! (reply to 22684)

cypherpunksO1: Great)

cypherpunksO1: Yeah, I heard about that, thanks (reply to 22685)

Yakitori: @howard_ton Is it ok to make PR to the tact docs? As I'm grinding them I see a few improvements to be made.

cypherpunksO1: Honestly, developing on TON is a new world for me. I would be grateful for any clear resources on developing on tact

Baldwin: After all, should I use camel or snake?

Spetsnaz: myAddress() (reply to 22656)

cypherpunksO1: Can you tell me how to process incoming contracted jettons? Get their quantity and contract

Spetsnaz: You can, check the content of Jetton or you can simply make non standard getter functions (reply to 22724)

Spetsnaz: This looks ok, but bear in mind that the balance is in another contract, the USDT jetton contract will create a new contract for the USDT jetton holding of your contract. You're basically replicating data in your contract. Also, think about when the USDT goes out from your wallet (reply to 22732)

Spetsnaz: From my understanding, getter functions are snake, the rest is up to you, I prefer camel (reply to 22755)

Spetsnaz: Can you elaborate? Create your contract, get the address, then transfer to that address. But keep in mind, your contract won't get the jettons in it, it will just be the owner of a wallet that contains those jettons (reply to 22739)

cypherpunksO1: Please (reply to 22759)

Spetsnaz: In your contract? Maybe you can use TokenNotification (reply to 22759)

Baldwin: Why doesn't ton have official documents for jetton and NFT?  I need them to confirm the correct documents to deploy my token (reply to 22766)

cypherpunksO1: Yes, I want that when sending jettons of contract n to my contract in can get in the handler the contract address of the jettons being sent and the number of jettons. (reply to 22766)

cypherpunksO1: There are official standards (reply to 22767)

Baldwin: Can you tell me about the NFT sample contract? (reply to 22769)

Baldwin: not found

Spetsnaz: TokenNotification doesn't have those kind information. The Jetton standard lacks some important data imo

cypherpunksO1: So by processing this event I can get this data? (reply to 22773)

Howard: 2 ways; but I am using the off-line like we did with most of NFTs on OpenSea(https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-template-in-tact/blob/193fe699e8d03d9debbf929f177895f82b90c1fe/sources/contract.deploy.ts#L10)  On-chain method might be too hard for the first time TON developer; you need store the fileds in the dictionary then turn into single Cell data type.

Naved: Please if anyone can help it would be really great

Diego: It‚Äôs not possible for now sending additional parameters in string messages, but you can create a custom message outside of your contract code like: message mywhitelist{ newAddress: Address;} and then receive it in your smart contract:   receive(msg: mywhitelist){‚Ä¶ msg.newAddress; ....}

Ken: https://tact-by-example.org/ (reply to 22883)

Naved: thank you (reply to 22887)

cypherpunksO1: You seem to have two identical checks (reply to 22882)

Naved: yes i am new to ton, first i was trying to directly call the function, then i got to know that i can not call function directly i have to call through a message (reply to 22891)

cypherpunksO1: Remove the checks from the addToWhitelist function, because they already exist in the receiver (reply to 22892)

Naved: is it correct now?

cypherpunksO1: Yeah, I think so. Don't forget the built-in self.requireOwner(); function to check what the creator sends to the contract (reply to 22894)

cypherpunksO1: self.requireOwner()   replaces   require(ctx.sender == self.owner_address, "Only the owner can whitelist");

Behrang: You have to use network config to calculate fee. There are some new opcodes in the latest release of TVM that will help you. (reply to 22916)

Yakitori: How do you manage to confirm an action after a message has been sent?  Say you want to send message B only if message A was sent and was successful.   I understand that you can use bounced, however will execution stop until we got a callback from message A, or will the bounced message come after the execution of the initial function has ended?

Yakitori: For instance, say that I want to deposit a token (say USDT) into a contract, and mint a token as a proof-of-deposit.  To mint, I need to ensure that the deposit was done and successful. Is there a simple way to do this ?

Viacheslav: tried, same, docs using this are outdated üôÅ (reply to 23079)

cypherpunksO1: Jetton is not mentioned in the official documentation. Just copy the contract code from there and use it at home (reply to 23080)

Viacheslav: yeah, will do, thanks (reply to 23081)

cypherpunksO1: Contact us)

Viacheslav: yeah, it worked

Viacheslav: is there any way to test jetton transfers in blueprint tests?

‚Äî 2024-04-27 ‚Äî

cypherpunksO1: And why not? Write tests for this (reply to 23086)

Viacheslav: I mean you have to deploy your own Jetton, no Jetton implementations in libs? (reply to 23113)

cypherpunksO1: And in TransferNotification, is the sender field a jetton wallet?

cypherpunksO1: Yes (reply to 23121)

cypherpunksO1: Good afternoon, how can I implement in tact to receive contract tokens and send them to the user's wallet?

Taro: use msg to receive (reply to 23303)

Taro: message(0xf8a7ea5) TokenTransfer {  sender: Address; }

Taro: like this

Taro: then     receive(msg: TokenTransfer){ let temp:Address = msg.sender;}

Gregory: I understand the general idea, however I‚Äôm very new to tact so ask for specific answer.  By the way, for the string it is better to use str: String and not msg (reply to 23320)

Taro: I'm new too

Gregory: I do not need the address of the sender. I need the address from the comment (address 1 could send a transaction and specify the address 2 as the text comment) (reply to 23324)

Diego: hello, is anyone else having this issue trying to deploy  2 subsequent contrats after calling the first one?

Spetsnaz: Check the error code (reply to 23524)

Spetsnaz: It could be related to not enough gas

Diego: nop in fact it doesn't produce any error I detected it because I tried to run a get function from the las contract and it wasn't  deployed

Spetsnaz: How are you testing? jest? (reply to 23529)

Diego: and after using many dumps i realized that it wasn't deployed

Diego: yes (reply to 23530)

Spetsnaz: I would make a jest test, check that there are 2 transition with deploy: true

Spetsnaz: If one fails, jest will dump the transaction results (in Expected)

Spetsnaz: Then read the dump and notice if there‚Äôs an error code in there

Diego: thats exactly as I have it

Diego: but it doesn't complain

Spetsnaz: I‚Äôm suspecting that there is no enough gas to deploy the second contract. Try deploying the second contract by itself (reply to 23536)

cypherpunksO1: Good afternoon, does anyone have the code to transfer the jettons received on contract? Please

cypherpunksO1: I wrote a contract to send the jettons sent to it back, but it does not send back, only accepts them. What is wrong?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Seems fine at first sight.  Check your ‚Äúenvironment‚Äù (in explorer) - that you actually receive notification msg, that opcode in it is same as in your compiled FunC code, etc. (reply to 23551)

cypherpunksO1: I checked it on the blockchain, everything works, but the tokens don't come back to the wallet (reply to 23554)

cypherpunksO1: Here are the opcodes

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: This is your incoming tx? You got 0.00‚Ä¶1 ton in notification - it‚Äôs too low to sendRemainingValue (and I guess too low even to start TVM to process incoming notification msg) (reply to 23555)

cypherpunksO1: But how do you fix it? (reply to 23557)

cypherpunksO1: Where to specify a value greater than?

cypherpunksO1: Here?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Do you want to pay for gas from your contract balance? I mean, everyone will send shit tokens to your contract, and your contract will pay  own coins for return? (reply to 23558)

cypherpunksO1: No, the user has to pay for the transfer (reply to 23561)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Then user should put value greater than 0.0‚Ä¶1 in his code. Yes, it‚Äôs forward-amount, but not in your contract (reply to 23562)

cypherpunksO1: Which one? Where do I specify that? (reply to 23563)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: You (contract owner) can‚Äôt. User who send you shit token - he must (in his wallet/code) (reply to 23564)

cypherpunksO1: Okay, what if I pay for the transfer?

cypherpunksO1: Or what if with the token just accepting the tone?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Then change value (and possibly mode) in your send code (reply to 23566)

cypherpunksO1: What's the value to change? I don't quite understand (reply to 23568)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: But you‚Äôll still fail to send back sometimes - when user will put too low value in his forward-amount and your contract code will not run at all (like in your screen) (reply to 23566)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: value: 0 (reply to 23569)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Think like you‚Äôre writing code to ‚Äúsimply send jettons‚Äù (your own jettons to your legit users) - with all fees etc.

cypherpunksO1: Changing forward_ton_amount it didn't help

Dmitry: Hello guys! What does it means is_right in forward_dayload? Does any documentation exist?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Still 0.0‚Ä¶1 on screen. TVM have no way to start (reply to 23574)

Miras: Hi everyone! Does anybody encounter a problem when using wrappers then the contract address generated fromInit() is different from actual one? I have passed init state exactly as it is but expecting address differs from actual one

Diego: I'm not only having the same issue from wrappers but also inside the contract (reply to 23791)

Diego: this generates two different addresses if I call it from 2 different contracts

Diego: return contractAddress(initOf NftAccountItem(id, collAddress));

Diego: I think it is a bug in Tact

dotfx: Ok replying to myself Active github repo: tact-lang/tact Very alive, definitely a good choice

Jay: Can try using tonapi deployment script instead of Tact Deployment script? (reply to 24831)

Yakitori: Do you know what the best practices are regarding gas forwarding? (reply to 24850)

Yakitori: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/message-mode

Yakitori: For each case, what is the typical situation?

Pavel: Where I can find information about difference between Slice and Slice as remaining?  I didn't find anything in docs

Artem: Hi everyone! Does anyone have an example of contract? Which takes ton from connected wallet and send it to another one. Or if possible, just lockup some ton on the wallet and unlock it by request? The second one is more preferable. Thanks in advance!

Yakitori: I have looked for this but there is no info in the docs (reply to 24898)

Pavel: That's I'm talking about) (reply to 24912)

·ó©·í™·ó¥·ô≠: ?

Ken: Slice as remaining just stores data using the remaining bits and refs of a cell, Slice stores data in a fresh new cell (reply to 24898)

User<6855931209>: Does anybody need a  developer?

Johnny Le: I want to use TokenNotification for 2 different function (1 is to record amount when an user deposit in money, 1 is for admin to deposit in money)

Johnny Le: But I got error redefinition of function, how can I fix

Jay: What is the error? (reply to 24961)

User<6855931209>: 9

Johnny Le: I can not use to receive with the same Notification (reply to 24963)

Johnny Le: receive(userDeposit: TokenNotification) receive(adminDeposit: TokenNotification)

Johnny Le: like this

Jay: Try define the logic inside the function, where sender() === self.admin (reply to 24967)

Johnny Le: so u mean use if else in 1 function ? (reply to 24970)

Jay: Yes can try (reply to 24971)

Johnny Le: if I want to defi in 2 function, then can I use send(SendParameters with body is tokentransfer ? (reply to 24972)

Jay: Yes you can, but I think since the receive define TokenNotification it'll come to that as well right (reply to 24973)

Johnny Le: thank mate (reply to 24974)

Jay: Happy to help (reply to 24975)

Louis: where are u from? (reply to 24976)

Jay: SG (reply to 24977)

Johnny Le: btw how to write a function that msg.sender call to its jetton wallet to transfer jetton token to contract (reply to 24976)

Johnny Le: cause at "to:", I dont know how to pass jetton wallet of msg.sender

Pavel: It calculates automatically inside defaultJettonWallet implementation (reply to 24983)

Jay: First we calculate the user jetton wallet address by passing in the jetton master wallet address. Can refer to this script.     const jettonMaster = client4.open(JettonMaster.create(Address.parse(JETTON_MASTER_ADDRESS)));     const TARGET_ADDRESS = await jettonMaster.getWalletAddress(USER_ADDRESS);   Then TARGET_ADDRESS is the user jetton wallet address right, we can send an instruction to it to send X amount of jetton to contract. See below.     let packed_msg = beginCell()         .storeUint(0x0f8a7ea5, 32)         .storeUint(0, 64)         .storeCoins(toNano(7)) //number of jetton to be sent         .storeAddress(Address.parse(SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)) //send to where? the contract address         .storeAddress(USER_ADDRESS) //when done, response to where         .storeUint(0, 1)         .storeCoins(toNano("0.4")) // forward amount         .endCell();   Then finally we trigger the sending             internal({                 to: TARGET_ADDRESS,                 value: toNano("0.5"),                 body: packed_msg,             }), (reply to 24982)

Johnny Le: thanks much lets me try (reply to 24986)

NB: Hello guys, I have a question about out-of-money contracts (TON coins).  I have a smart contract that has performed many transactions, however, from now on I will no longer use that smart contract so I will withdraw all money from the contract.  I want to ask if this is a problem? For example, about 10 years later, I want to check the transactions of this contract, can I check? (I do not create new transactions on this contract)  Thank you for your support

Artem: I thought, that lock coins more secure. Otherwise I need to have separate contract for every user. Is this kind of thing possible? (reply to 24980)

Howard: üëçüèæ (reply to 24929)

Howard: https://tact-by-example.org/all (reply to 24911)

Daniil: all contracts must pay fees for storing data on-chain. if your contract stops paying these fees (for example, you withdraw all its balance), it'll become frozen after some time, and if it's frozen for long enough, it'll get deleted from blockchain completely.  transaction history could still be visible, though, but there are no guarantees that it will be visible forever. (reply to 25001)

Pavel: The difference between bounce: true and mode: SendBounceIfActionFail is that in first case it bounces if contract can't receive this type of message or contract doesn't exist and in second case it bounces if revert occurs during action?  If bounce set to true and contract revert during action, than this won't bounce without this mode?

gavin: Hello guys, I would like to ask if there are any DEX Dapps written in Tact language now? I want to learn

Howard: At this moment, no.  But I heard that some people are trying to do so. (reply to 25029)

gavin: Ok, thank you for your reply (reply to 25033)

Howard: Since a DEX is highly transaction-intensive, we still recommend building on FunC. However, it also requires more time to learn and build, so you need to assess your project scope and team size to determine which language to use. (reply to 25035)

Pavel: When working with different protocols, I cannot be sure that I will always have enough gas. Will bounce work if I set mode: SendBounceIfActionFail and run out of gas while performing actions?  As far as I understand, enough gas must be reserved for bounce in this case.

Steven: 7

Steven: How should I deploy the contract, I need help

Steven: Case deployment always fails

Jay: Can try tonapi deployment instead of tact verifier? (reply to 25046)

Steven: I still want to figure it out

Valera: Check ur imports (Contract, pkg). Check path to build folder (outputPath), and Paste ur imported Contract instead of SampleTactContract. Also check ur code (reply to 25046)

Pavel: Oh, you are the owner of the git repository that contains the jetton example. I just have questions about your implementation) Can you answer if it‚Äôs not difficult?  1) For example, why in jetton.tack#L211 such a balance check, we use safeMath by default, so it should be replaced with require(self.balance >= msg.amount, "Invalid amount");  before subtraction.  2) Why is response_destination of type address?, although in TEP-74 this parameter is set explicitly. Should it be address and may have value address(0,0)?  3) Why don't we use mode: SendBounceIfActionFail in burn/mint receivers, since we don't have gas checks there?  In general, thanks for the example, it‚Äôs very clear and helps in understanding architecture! (reply to 25012)

Steven: Yes, I checked my code again and found no problem. The error message is that my connection failed. Is the deployment address invalid, or is it a problem with my proxy? (reply to 25049)

Jay: Oh also can check if you ran the build command to build the TACT output files? (reply to 25049)

Jay: I've hit this before as well, try another connection (mobile data) (reply to 25052)

User<6855931209>: Does anybody need a  developer?

Daniil: that sounds exactly as the thing I dreamed of few months ago! does it only work with Tact or I can pass arbitrary transactions? (reply to 25071)

Nerses: Hello everyone,  I'm encountering a problem while testing a smart contract written in Tact language. I use the printTransactionFees(result.transactions) function to observe transaction details, and I notice that the transaction fails as expected with a specific exit code. However, when I run a check to verify the transaction status, it unexpectedly shows success: true. Here's the check I'm using: expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({     from: hashedTimeLockTON.address,     to: receiver,     success: false, });

Sunny: Hi everyone! Could you please help me about this: I have a code snippet in Tact language for emitting an event in bellow: receive("transfer") {     emit(TransferEvent{amount: ton("1.25"), recipient: sender()}.toCell()); }  My question is how to listen that emit event from scripts/frontend. Actually i need the code to listen for this event. Hope to receive help from you guys. Thank you in advance!

Creator: Please help guys.  Why is this problem? Where is the mistake? (reply to 25606)

Denis: I've encountered the same problem. There seems to be a bug that generates the interfaces for imported contracts with a bit different sorting order when you code is generated for different contracts. And then this interfaces with different sorting are hashed to construct the IPFS link and that link get's embedded into your contracts source code (! that's a very bad thing it's not on demand). And that's what makes the source code and thus the resulting addresses differ.  Unfortunately I have no solution, we've finished our prototype with a workaround and are done with Tact for now.

Sumit: is there no way to have completely seprate collection data and individual nft data on ton?

Nerses: Hi everyone. Who can help to do method call to deployed smart contract ?

–≠–ª—å–¥–∞—Ä: so many questions and so few answers, sad

–ê–º–∏—Ä: Check logs, exit codes, use ~dump (reply to 26073)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/get-methods ? (reply to 26089)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md check TEP-64 standard (reply to 26080)

Sumit: but all these generally mean that  collection will store base url (reply to 26100)

Sumit: And a suffix for each nft can be added in form of token id and some constant string

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Each NFT Item and NFT Collection itself has its own metadata  If you store metadata with single base uri and different "endings" - its only your choice (reply to 26101)

Nerses: unfortunately no.here is spoken only about get methods while I need to do simple internal call(send message) to deployed smart contract (reply to 26099)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: "Invoking get methods from other contracts" is a section there (reply to 26104)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: you asked " to do method call" - its about get-methods. if you want "send message" - look into sending messages

Sumit: Nope. That has to be mandatory (reply to 26103)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: can you quote plz ? (reply to 26107)

Sumit: See, its always the collection content that is sent in the initOf the contract (reply to 26108)

Sumit: if you provide unique cells. Then the contracts addresses wont be predictable

Nerses: in my case the function which I want to call isnt get method.it is function to do transaction.Maybe i described the question in wrong way (reply to 26105)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: collection content does not means "item content" (reply to 26110)

Sumit: but collection content has the base uri and item content is something like ‚Äú10/meta.json‚Äù or something (reply to 26113)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: contracts can interact inly by sending messages.  look into "internal msg" (reply to 26112)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: why you think its "mandatory" ? (reply to 26114)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: try to describe in more detail what do you want to achieve

Sumit: Is this not enough case? (reply to 26114)

Sumit: I want each NFT to have a full uri content of its own

Sumit: ‚ÄúMint‚Äù method does not take uri as an argument

Sumit: So how can an nft has its own data.

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: this is not mandatory (reply to 26119)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: if you want each nft has its own uri - do it. you just need to "deliver" this uri somehow to it

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: (and, its not mandatory to have this uri at all, all metadata can be onchain)

Sumit: there would be one downside in that case, the contract will not be able to tell me the address of the NFT item if i dont have the its ‚Äúindividual content‚Äù cell (reply to 26125)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: also, make sure you found that collection is optional (nft may be collection-less), as https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md says

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: it would, if you make "individual content" initially empty (reply to 26127)

Tom - Bushi: hey all, new to tact. Taking a look at the random number generating fun randomInt(). I am wondering if under the hood it uses the randomize_lt() found in funC or if its less safe than the funC alternatives? Any tips on randomness in general?

Pavlo Voronyuk: Hi there ! Maybe here someone who prepared to create few contracts on Tact ? How it cost ?

Vitor: One option is to run tact with ‚Äîfunc argument and check the generated FunC code. (reply to 26496)

A: Just some more notes:  randomInt (from tact) - generates random number randomize_lt (from func) - set random seed for random generator with current logical time (equivalent to randomize(cur_lt()))  Basically, nativeRandomizeLt (from tact) is equivalent to randomize_lt (from func) randomInt (from tact) is equivalent to random (from func)  and under the hood it uses native func functions:  https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/e080f7f180da318363584530b6801b3e7bb4d11e/stdlib/std/math.tact#L20 (reply to 26496)

Creator: Hi everyone.  This is a question, maybe you know the reason for this awkward situation.  Im trying to create contract, which  must manage jettons on JettonDefaultWallet. I use the default JettonDefaultWallet and JettonMaster.  But in the contract it gives a different result than when I ask JettonMastera for the JettonVolet address at the my contract address. I thought this was in a test environment. But it‚Äôs the same on the testnet. And everything seems to be according  to the manual.   let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);         let wallet_address: Address = contractAddress(init);   Func:   ((slice, slice, slice, int, slice, slice, (int, int), int, int, slice), ()) $JobOffer$_fun_send_deposit((slice, slice, slice, int, slice, slice, (int, int), int, int, slice) $self, slice $address, int $amount) impure inline_ref {     var (($self'order, $self'title, $self'description, $self'price, $self'owner, $self'doer, ($self'job_state'doer, $self'job_state'owner), $self'state, $self'is_locked, $self'jetton_master)) = $self;     var ($ctx'bounced, $ctx'sender, $ctx'value, $ctx'raw) = __tact_context_get();     var ($init'code, $init'data) = $JettonDefaultWallet$_init_child(__tact_context_sys, my_address(), $self'jetton_master);     slice $to = $global_contractAddress(($init'code, $init'data));     $global_send($SendParameters$_constructor_to_value_mode_body_data_code($to, 0, (64 | 2), $TokenTransfer$_store_cell($TokenTransfer$_constructor_query_id_amount_sender_response_destination_custom_payload_forward_ton_amount_forward_payload(0, $amount, my_address(), $address, end_cell(begin_cell()), 100000000, $Cell$_fun_asSlice(end_cell(begin_cell())))), $init'data, $init'code));     return (($self'order, $self'title, $self'description, $self'price, $self'owner, $self'doer, ($self'job_state'doer, $self'job_state'owner), $self'state, $self'is_locked, $self'jetton_master), ()); }    And it turns out that the only way out is to transfer the init + data code for the flight token manually after deployment. But this is kind of an ugly solution. Perhaps you know what the problem is in the story now.   Thank you

Vlad: Hm, but considering the fact that modes are 2^sth (so all use different bits) there shouldn't be a problem

Anton: Bitwise Or is idempotent, so it‚Äôs safer to use it: 16 | 16 is still 16, but 16 + 16 is 32, so if you accidentally use the same flag twice, you are still fine (kind of). Actually, we can and should catch mistakes like this one statistically (reply to 26793)

Tom - Bushi: Hey guys, coming from a solidity background Im wondering what is the benefit of having many small contracts which send messages to each other, which seems to be the suggested way of developing on TON, above having one larger contract like in EVM? Why is this type of contract splitting beneficial?

Vitor: Basically re the differences in the storage cost model from the TVM to the EVM. (reply to 27146)

Aleksandr: Scaling. The problem with EVM model is the atomic transaction nature. You either do everything in single transaction, or you cannot do it at all. It is somewhat like having one enourmous database with everything on single machine vs splitting that database into shards. System complexity in TON model is definitely higher, but it is scalable. (reply to 27146)

Vitor: There's a decent write up called "Actor model in Everscale", which is another chain with roots on the TVM.

Benedict: Hi everyone, we have opened a new in meta universe p2e project for which we are looking for people to join our team to work on the project.  Beta tester - from 55$ per hour  NFT Artist - personally negotiable Game Designer - from $4000/month Moderator - from 600 bucks (week) Developer - to be discussed personally (depending on qualifications)  Payment in BTC, ETH, USDT (weekly). We are waiting for you in a developing and promising team! Write to DM.

fa: guys, can anyone tell me how I can connect my Python backend using a smart contract, I need people to be able to top up the balance on the site with tones and withdraw the same

Mookid: I'm looking for someone who can help me complete a script that will place existing NFTs on Getgems all at once for one price  https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/message-builders  Ready to pay extra for urgency

Mookid: That is, there are 600 nft already minted, and I just need to list them at the same price

Bc. ≈Ωak: Hey devs, can i use message in my constructor like:```init(msg: MintToken, owner: Address)```? compiler says: Field initialized is not set

Anton: could it be because your contract has an initialized field which is not actually set? (reply to 27289)

Bc. ≈Ωak: yeah, you right, i thought it means something with contructor, not my variable, tnx (reply to 27291)

Bc. ≈Ωak: is there a way to emit an address? im tring to: emit(myAddress().toCell()) nut address is not castable to cell. any solutions?

Bc. ≈Ωak: shoud i wrap it to message  struct and then emit the message?

Dan: Hi guys! I do not understand something. When calling the receive() in contract, how can I get the exact amount of tons that the user is sending to the contract? Is it equal to myBalance() or context().value?

Bc. ≈Ωak: Is there a way to parse emited log in test? i got the body but a belive it is a cell, i need to parse to get data from it. How shoud i proceed?

Tom - Bushi: hey guys, I have a question about gas usage and error handling.   Say I got some complex logic with many contracts user -> contractA -> contractB -> C -> D and I get an error or lack of permission in contract D. I would like to roll back the changes made in the previous contracts, but as I understand it that would also take gas right? But from what I understand, if I run out of gas at some point, the logic just stops at the point where there was no more gas.   So potentially it could stop mid change reversal in contractB and leave the changes in contract A inTact (pun semi-intended).   How is stuff like this handled? Should the user just be sending enough gas to cover all potential routes of logic?

Ken: there's no established patterns to solve your question. I just require a TON of gas (pun also semi-intended) to cover all paths and refund any extra at the end. (reply to 27539)

Nerses: Can smart contract have only recieve() for handling with incoming messages and DO NOT  have any function e.g. fun sendMsg() to send message ? will smart contract work correctly ? (recieve messaages and handle,and accounts be able to interact with smart contract)

Nerses: so it will only need correct message parameters to process and recieve() will handle with data as needed ?

Nerses: If my smart contract doesnt have any function only recieve() s can any arbitrary account send message to the contract ? Or for internal messages it is must to have functions in smart contract so every account will be able to interact with it ?

Tom - Bushi: hey guys, Im a bit confused by the TEP-62 standard, specifically metadata fetching.   Do I correctly understand, that on the individual NFT I fetch individual_content via the get_nft_data getter, which I can then use to get the whole metadata or metadata link from the collection via get_nft_content(index: Int, individual_content: Cell)?

Karim: To send message we can use SendRemainingValue to send all the value left from the message. How can I subtract some value from remaining value and send such message?  For example: 1. User sends 2 TON 2. Contract collects exactly 1 TON from user 3. Contract sends remaining value back, so that user gets get (1 TON ‚Äì all_the_fees)

Karim: Actually I don't understand how to calculate all_the_fees value. Is it possible to in runtime? (reply to 28181)

Lev: Are addresses serialized as workchain_id:int8 address:uint256?

Ilya: Hi everyone,  I need some advice. I'm learning Tact and trying to build a smart contract that can accept USDT from one address, hold it for a while, and then send it to another address. I know how to send TON, but I'm not sure how to send USDT on the TON blockchain.  I found USDT Asset Processing on TON, but I'm still confused. Can someone explain the steps I need to take and where to look for information? Is it possible to do this with just Tact?  The goal is for a user to log in with TON Connect, send USDT to another user (who also connects with TON Connect), and after some time, the sender sends another transaction to release the funds to the receiver.  Thanks for your help!

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I mean I have a defined struct type, but the Cell field can contain arbitrary data. If some conditions tell me that this Cell contains a struct, how do I cast this Cell to a variable of this struct type?

Alex: How can I test the map<Int, String> in js tests?

Aydin: Cell is (packed) serialized data. So:  1. Convert it to slice  2. Deserialize it  3. Cast the result into your struct type (reply to 28590)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Wouldn't struct have the same memory layout as the whole cell basically? (reply to 28609)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Or a slice of the cell of our interest. (reply to 28611)

Aydin: No. These are different types.   Cell/slice is like a "train" of data having been put in order, one piece after another. (And of course, with at most 4 references to other cells.)  But struct is like a "vector" with multiple dimensions. (reply to 28613)

Ilya: Hi guys, can somebody help me to understand, im trying to send Jetton from one address to another, but its not working, what is wrong here ?      await test.send(         provider.sender(),         {             value: toNano('0.05')         },         {             queryId: 1n,             $$type: "InitiateTransfer",             amount: toNano("0.2"),             recipient: address('0QCnkeLAqVdHLKxHj2mQGgFqfoxOpic_NafnyVjpMd4tSoKG'),             forward_ton_amount:  toNano('0.02')         }     )   receive(msg: InitiateTransfer) {         self.transactionCounter += 1;          send(SendParameters{             to: sender(), // address with jettons ( from which we will send values )             bounce: true,             value: 0,             mode: SendRemainingBalance + SendIgnoreErrors,             body: TokenTransfer{                 queryId: 2,                 amount: msg.amount,                 response_destination: self.usdtWallet,                 forward_ton_amount: msg.forward_ton_amount,                 destination: self.usdtWallet,                 custom_payload: null,                 forward_payload: emptyCell().asSlice(),             }.toCell()         });      }

Nick: Anyone experienced with TON DNS contracts?

Mahima Thacker: Should we store multiple Strings in one Cell?

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: What slice? I don't see any slice. In your mint message receiver, by the logic, you have to generate the description and the image url, not to decode it from something. (reply to 28693)

Mahima Thacker: Oh Okay, Could you please explain what should I use for that? (reply to 28716)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: You should just pass literal strings as the description and the URL. Or, maybe use StringBuilder, if they differ for different items (but on this step, in "Mint" receiver, you can only tell items apart by current next_item_index). (reply to 28718)

Mahima Thacker: How can I pass three string in the custom_payload? (reply to 28719)

Mahima Thacker: Does it support this?

ABRAHAM: Hi everyone, how to disable tact auto verify smart contract when deploy?

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Your encode_metadata correctly packs the strings to Cell. (reply to 28721)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: However, IIRC, it should be a well formed json, not just a bunch of strings. (reply to 28724)

Mahima Thacker: Okay, got it. Thanks for the help

Dhruv: hello guys, I am facing an issue related passing metadata Uri which is String type and i am facing this while creating new NFT, so when i try to create new nft that transaction got automatically rejected from wallet and got "User rejected the transaction request from their wallet", I am using tact smart contract.  If i do same for nft collection data then it is working fine, but while creting nft i'm facing such issue, please help me here  Also if i modify Mint message in contract in such way that it can receive some integer value or data type then it is also working good, but only when I try to use String then i am facing issue.

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: From your description it's hard to say what the problem is about. (reply to 28740)

Johnny Le: TON API provides REST API access to TON Blockchain. Some of its methods require to fill the {account-id} variable. What should I put there, what value format does it accept?

Dhruv: my problem is that I'm not able to pass String type data from frontend to the smart contract but for integer and other data type it is working good (reply to 28745)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I guess, it's just an address in its "unfriendly" form 0:hexstring. Use ton.org/address to convert addresses. (reply to 28755)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Do you mean the opcode? Like "Mint"? I think, you should pass crc32 of the string. (reply to 28757)

Dhruv: let me share you code (reply to 28760)

Dhruv: sharing you in personal here it's got deleted (reply to 28761)

Johnny Le: thank br (reply to 28758)

Nerses: Hi everyone ! How can I update my TACT version from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 /

Louis: Hello everyone, when performing a jetton transfer in FE Next.js, can I obtain the event_id to match it with the data returned from https://tonapi.io/v2/accounts/0:b2c460ee69644d52d8f5aae5aacda4bee41b103d62f0250764ac495280b7802b/events?limit=10?

Nerses: I updated TACT version to 1.3.0 but still get error `Syntax error: expected ")" |         foreach (key, value in msg.data.amount)` (reply to 28231)

Nerses: What can cause that ?

Vitor: Can you share a minimal snippet that reproduces your problem? (reply to 28783)

Nerses: let ctx: Context = context();          let totalAmount: Int = 0;                  foreach (key, value in (msg.data.amount)) {             require(value != 0,"Funds Not Sent");             totalAmount += value;         }         require(ctx.value == totalAmount,"Incorrect Data");     } (reply to 28785)

Vitor: Not sure if (msg.data.amount) works, can you assign it to a variable and try write the foreach as foreach(k, v in myMap)? If it does work, let me know and I'll open a GitHub issue. (reply to 28786)

Nerses: I will try now and let you know (reply to 28787)

Nerses: Yeah it was the problem (reply to 28787)

Nerses: after assigning new variable it builds

Anton: At this moment only identifiers can be used as maps to be traversed, arbitrary expressions are not allowed (reply to 28783)

Nerses: how can I know length of map ? I wanna use while loop but couldnt find statment like break to exit out of loop

Ken: this is a bad idea, you should store length of map separately (reply to 28803)

Nerses: Then how to handle with case when you get message and there are few maps which lengths should be equal,How to check if they equal or not ? (reply to 28805)

Ken: why don't you change the message to map<idx, struct> instead?

Nerses: i cant change beacuse of the application architecture i am trying to implement. In your approach message sender can pass wrong values and equality check will pass although it shouldnt (reply to 28807)

Anton: There should be a relevant example in the Tact docs (reply to 28803)

Nerses: couldnt find something about break  in this materials https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/statements (reply to 28810)

Nerses: and also here nothing was mentioned https://tact-by-example.org/04-loops

Anton: I was answering the first question (reply to 28811)

Anton: There is no break statement atm

Made by: Hello everyone, I‚Äôm trying to contribute to tondynasty contracts with Upgradable trait.  https://github.com/bymoses/tondynasty-contracts/blob/feat/upgradable/tests/UpgradableExample.spec.ts  Here you can find tests for this trait and code updates (functions add/update) are working fine, but when there is some change in storage fields of contract (see v3) it breaks something within Cells. I don‚Äôt have deep understanding of what‚Äôs happening here so I need some help to write native funC wrapper for set_data function that will not corrupt contract Cells

Nerses: https://tact-by-example.org/04-maps (reply to 28814)

Nerses: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/maps

Nerses: i have read these materials but nothing could find

Nerses: is there any other reference ?

Made by: @AntonTrunov maybe you could give me some clue about what‚Äôs happening when we call native set_data within tact contract and why is it breaking storage

Anton: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/data-structures#array (reply to 28820)

Nerses: What about the case when I get message which contains few maps and I should check lengths equality.Should I implement array or there is more optimal way ? (reply to 28822)

Anton: There not enough info in your problem statement to answer

Anton: It depends if you trust the source, if you can include the length info or it‚Äôs to late to do that, in the worst case you can just calculate it by traversing the map

Nerses: no i dont trust the source. (reply to 28825)

Nerses: so it would be more clever to use foreach than implement array ?

Anton: please forget the arrays, it‚Äôs just an example, the foreach statement is your friend

Nerses: thnx (reply to 28828)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Do you mean that it breaks when a contract's storage structure changes? I was planning to implement just that, so I'm interested in how it goes. (reply to 28816)

Made by: Yup, you could find details at the github issue, there‚Äôs some weird behaviour occurring when you try to add new field to the contract (reply to 28830)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Maybe it's Tact who expects something internal in storage and gets confused? @AntonTrunov (reply to 28831)

Made by: If I get this snippet of compiled code right, it‚Äôs likely not the Tact issue, but maybe missuse of set_data function itself (reply to 28832)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Look at generated recv_internal in build/tact_YourContract.code.fc. It calls YourContract_contract_store at the end, which calls set_data. (reply to 28833)

Made by: Could you help me to figure this out because I have zero experience in func? (reply to 28835)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: As I understand, the problem is that Tact's runtime rewrites contract's storage after all of your code. So, it appears that we cannot really replace a contract's data from within Tact. I have no idea, if it's possible to sustainably work around this. (reply to 28837)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: By "Tact runtime" here I mean all that FunC wrapper code that gets generated upon build.

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I suspect that when you upgrade your contract without changing fields, the storage, in fact, will still contain the old data.

Made by: Oh I see (reply to 28838)

Made by: So now the only pure tact option is to only rely on code upgrades and wait for native approach for storage upgrades?

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Seems so. (reply to 28844)

Made by: It seems like there we need to wait for 1.4.0 for native upgrades mechanism https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/27#issuecomment-2124694217 (reply to 28845)

Made by: But I‚Äôm not familiar with tact development cycles so is there some chance devs decide to delay this feature?

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Upvoted the issue. I hope it will indeed get through. (reply to 28846)

Made by: Do you know some ways to post process func to bypass this behaviour on upgrade, maybe as a temporary solution we can make simple middleware script? (reply to 28838)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I don't see any feasible solution. There's some Blueprint plugin mechanism. Maybe that could get called after the build and modify already generated *.fc files. But how would it know if it needs to eliminate set_data call? (reply to 28851)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Let's hope. (reply to 28847)

Made by: Actually if there will be standardised upgrade msg op code we could make some branching before line 20 (reply to 28852)

Mahima Thacker: Hey guys, do we need to convert maps to a cell in order to get the values using its key?

Mahima Thacker: I tried to get the nft addresss using its index but getting null here:       address: map<Int, Address>;  fun mint(sender: Address, msgValue: Int, individual_metadata: Cell ) {         require(self.next_item_index >= 0, "non-sequential NFTs");         let nft_init: StateInit = self.getNftItemInit(self.next_item_index,individual_metadata );         let add: Address = contractAddress(nft_init);         self.address.set(self.next_item_index, add);      get fun get_nft_address_by_index(item_index: Int): Address? {         // self.address.asCell();         return self.address.get(item_index);     } (reply to 28859)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: It's currently hardcoded. https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/1590a4cc8a943d8c19495f2945fd539b6bf4a48c/src/generator/writers/writeContract.ts#L324 (reply to 28855)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/1590a4cc8a943d8c19495f2945fd539b6bf4a48c/src/generator/writers/writeContract.ts#L99

Made by: Yup, we could try using blueprint plugins as post processing (reply to 28864)

Made by: I will test idea with custom op code later today, maybe it will work

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Maybe, you'll be better off with wrappers/yourcontract.compile.ts script. See blueprint's compile pipeline: https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint/blob/main/src%2Fcompile%2Fcompile.ts#L136 (reply to 28870)

Made by: Brilliant! Post compile hook is  much more suitable approach (reply to 28880)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Unfortunately, it's too late to intervene here because Tact already has its FunC code compiled at this point. I suppose, you're gonna have to use funCOnly option, then run your hook, and only then manually compile those fc files with FunC compiler. Not a clean solution, though. (reply to 28884)

Made by: Sure, I‚Äôm thinking of it as a temporary workaround until devs introduce a native solution. Technically maybe I will use just regexp for testing this thing and then depending on results we will figure out how to make this pretty (reply to 28885)

Made by: But it‚Äôs kinda unfortunate that you can‚Äôt intervene in compilation pipeline

Ilya: Hi guys, everyone.   The included dump (ala log) increases the gas consumption of the contract, right?

Nerses: If size of map affects on gas fee and based to my architecture I cant specify limit of maps.How can I find optimal way to specify as transaction amount to pass computation phase and escape from exit code 37 ?

Nostra: Hey guys whats the best way to validate in my dapp if a transaction was successful? I am calling the contract with my client however as a result I get undefined. Would appreciate your help üôè

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I guess, your main concern should be storage fee. As for gas, you probably should estimate it based on the current length of the map. (reply to 29132)

Nerses: yeah exactly.Do you have any ideas ? (reply to 29150)

Vasily: Hey guys! Maybe someone here can give me a clue =) My team is developing a Traction Eye service where a user can analyse not only tokens but also the DeFi protocols he uses.  We have a technical question from the backend side: 1)Is it possible to get the data of protocols used by a particular wallet:  - Liquid pools (Dedust, StonFi) - Lending protocol (EVAA)  - Staking providers (Bemo, Stakers, Stakee, etc). How can this be implemented? To make it clearer what data we are talking about, you can see the mockup.

Nerses: the problem is that my map changes dynamically and In contract I should notify other party so sending message,for it I send money so the computation phase will pass and I writ in contract certain amount.But as I see chnages of map length can affect to that amount so after some time when map exceeds the normal length all notifying messages will fail getting exit code 37 (reply to 29150)

Nostra: I also emit a log for a successful transaction how would you call the rpc client to query it ? (reply to 29140)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I would suggest refactoring your architecture. And be cautious about your contract being drained if it can be forced to spend money. To calculate gas on map traversal, you can try to locate this code in compiled fift file (in build difectory), look up TVM instructions gas prices and estimate the cost by multiplying it on length of your map (or log of length). (reply to 29153)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I. e. estimate one iteration by summing up gas prices of instructions. Then multiply.

Nerses: could you please give me some insight ? By refactoring architecture you mean  specifying limit ? (reply to 29159)

Aydin: /ban (reply to 29169)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: I mean that you would probably try to follow TON's paradigm: use blockchain itself as an array. Like like jetton master creates jetton wallets instead of storing amounts in a map. (reply to 29161)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Or at least make the map bounded.

Nerses: I think bounded map is better as first approach will contradict to my applications architecture. And what about sharding ? I think it can be solution as well

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Sharding won't be of any help for you, if you have a single contract. (reply to 29175)

Nerses: Let me give you some context. In my map I store structs.What if I try with sharding split that data among child contracts ? Thats why I thought It can be solution (reply to 29176)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Are you afraid your child contracts end up in different shards? Well, it's better to push logic to the child contracts when possible, so that they can communicate with each other without touching master contract. If possible. Anyway, I don't think sharding nowadays is a big concern. (reply to 29180)

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Jetton master + jetton wallets and NFT collection + NFT item work just like that.

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Wallet-to-wallet doesn't talk to master.

Aydin: I guess Nerses is using the term "shard" with a meaning different from TON's Infinite Sharding Paradigm.  By "shard", Nerses is actually refering to the parent-child model.  Am I right? (reply to 29181)

For example, I minted an NFT item on GetGems and then made it "hidden". Now, when I explore my wallet using TonViewer, I can see the NFT under the "Collectibles" tab with no problem. However, when I switch to TonScan, it cannot be found under the "NFTs" tab, though one can still find it by tracing the transaction history of the wallet. (reply to 29456)

Vitor: Looking to write a MEV Bot? :D I recommend you look into Pytoniq implementation of a LiteClient, it's easy to understand how ADNL over TCP works and how transactions are propagated. (reply to 29736)

It's: No I do not want. I need to track users' transactions and see their transactions before they are completed. For some reason the GraphQL API throws an error. Plus, the operation of a mevbot on the network is impossible due to the lack of an increase in transaction speed with the help of a commission. (reply to 29744)

Vitor: I know, it was just a mempool joke. If you want to track mempool-to-inblock status, I'd recommend you take one of the open source indexers (ton-indexer or anton) and start from that. (reply to 29745)

It's: Thanks for the answer, but I still don't understand why I can't access the mempool through my paid tone api via node.js (reply to 29747)

Vitor: The network natively "speaks" ADNL. APIs offer whatever their dev decided to offer. I'm surprise TonAPI doesn't support it though, as Tonkepper uses and it has push notifications for when the transactions go from mempool to being in a block. (reply to 29748)

Vitor: https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi/streaming-api#real-time-notifications-about-finalized-transactions It does support it.

Illia: Wow, that's so good, thanks! (reply to 29993)

Illia: The address of your wallet is derived from your public key and the wallet's code. It means that if you change your wallet's code, you will have it deployed under a different address.  This can be illustrated using the following equation: public key + code = wallet address  Hence  public key + code v3r2 = wallet address v3r2   public key + code v3r3 = wallet address v3r3  Therefore, when you change your wallet version, you change your wallet's code and hence have your NFT deployed to a completely different address! (reply to 30026)

Illia: As far as I am concerned, there is no way to decode the BoC without knowing its TL-B. TL-B is a schema of the message. It's like protobuf. BoC is binary data and it can be literally anything.  Well, you may try to brute-force all possible combinations of what the original message could look like and see if the decoded data makes any sense. But I don't think that you're interested in decoding a single BoC.    Therefore the answer is that there is no way to decode BoC without its TL-B. Please feel free to correct me if my reasoning is somewhere wrong. (reply to 30034)

Anton: üöÄ Tact v1.3 release notes  The new Tact v1.3 release provides a massive improvement on the smart contract programming for TON blockchain.  üó∫ Maps  Traversing a map has never been easier! The foreach loop for the Map type:  let mapLength: Int = 0; foreach (k, v in map) {   mapLength += 1; }   You don't have to use map.set(key, null) to remove a key from your maps, use the more intuitive del method instead: map.del(key).  Want to check if the map is empty? Use map.isEmpty()!  üî§ Strings   Strings finally support escape sequences, like \\, \", \n, \u0000 through \uFFFF, etc.  There is a new non-modifying StringBuilder's concat method for chained string concatenations: b = b.concat("Hello,").concat(foo).concat("Tact!").  We added the toString method for the Address type that you asked for numerous times in the dev chats: address("EQBKgXCNLPexWhs2L79kiARR1phGH1LwXxRbNsCFF9doc2lN").toString().  üëå Handling exceptions  Want to process various TVM and user-defined exit codes before your contract fails at runtime? The try and try-catch statements: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/statements#try-catch:   try {     let foo: Int = 42 / 0; } catch(e) {     // your division by zero handler }   ‚òÄÔ∏è New quality-of-life improving syntax  Tact started supporting struct fields punning, i.e. {foo, bar} is syntactic sugar for { foo: foo, bar: bar }.  There is support for trailing commas in all comma-separated lists in Tact, here is how you can use it with structs:      foo(Struct {     field1: 42,     field2: "42",   })     You can now chain method calls with the unboxing operator !!, e.g. map.asCell()!!.hash().  For those missing some bit-level hackery, there is the bitwise XOR operator ^ available now.  ‚öôÔ∏è Stdlib enhancements   The Tact team has added log2 and log, pow2 and pow functions.  Use reserve mode constants from @stdlib/reserve instead of their numeric values to make your code even easier to read: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve-base-modes.  üß† Debugging  Debugging has become easier now as the dump() and dumpStack() functions now print the file path, line number, and column number in addition to the data specified by the programmer.  Addresses can be arguments of the dump function.  üíª Tact CLI  Tact's command line interface just became a lot more user-friendly: run npx tact --help from terminal and see what's available.  Just a highlight: CLI now allows compiling a single Tact file directly, without specifying a config file: npx tact your-awesome-contract.tact. It's very useful for quick experiments or bug reports.  üõ† Third-party tools support   For third-party tools implementors there is new improved APIs: AST traversals, access to the AST store of top-level items like functions, constants, traits, etc.  Happy hacking! ‚ù§Ô∏è  Check out Tact's CHANGELOG for the comprehensive list of features, changes and bugfixes.  Check out the Tact docs and read about the new Tact features.  To upgrade your Blueprint-based Tact projects to use Tact v1.3.1, run npm upgrade inside the project folder.

Illia: I have a map defined as fizz: map<Address, Int as uint8>;  The maximum number of elements stored in this map is 250.  1) How to calculate the worst-case computation fee for rizz.get(key: Address) given the key-value pairs limit? What's the best-case fee? The average-case fee?  2) What the structure used to store dicts in TVM? Is it a binary tree or a trie? Does Tact uses bear dicts under the hood?  3) How to calculate storage fee for the map depending on the number of key-value pairs stored inside?

Illia: I have also encountered a problem when compiling foreach with self.rizz as a map to iterate over.  Is it a bug or there is a deliberate limitation on such syntax? (reply to 30194)

Anton: It‚Äôs a restriction we are going to lift in the next release (1.4). Iterating over storage maps will be possible (reply to 30195)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: Do I able load the data from other smart contract wile action execution?

Anton: You can only communicate with other contracts through sending messages to them (reply to 30230)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: Is there a simple and cheap way to send messages to all jetton holders?

Illia: Do you want an 'on-chain' or 'off-chain' solution?   The off-chain solution may be to fetch all jetton holders using tonapi.io and then send a message directly to their addresses (reply to 30233)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: I need on-chain solution. When an event occurs, all jetton holders must receive an additional portion of jettons. (reply to 30234)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: It seems that for this I should make wallets like a linked list, so that the next field is stored in the next wallet. But this solution may not work if at least one of the wallets is frozen due to a negative balance. Is it possible to find some better on-chain solution for this problem?

Ken: unlikely. it seem that your design is flawed (reply to 30235)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: What do you mean? What could you suggest instead? (reply to 30246)

Ken: depends on your business requirement. what you want to do is simply impossible

Illia: there is no easy solution because the jetton wallet address is derived  from (jetton_master + holder)  to notify everyone you either need to have a huge map (which is strongly not recommended and is a very bad idea as it doesn't scale)  but this can be a good idea if you have up  to 250 elements, I guess, I still try to figure out how gas is calculated for mappings  you can also try to create something like 'channel' contract which deploys subscriptions from (channel address + subscription id = 0) but deriving address costs ~0.005 TON for single contract + transfer 0.005 approximately  so to message 1000 holders it will cost 10 tons  there easiest way is to make jetton holders claim their tokens by themselves, so you create such contract and then other people just send a message to claim their tokens (reply to 30239)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: Yes, I see. Seems like claiming is the best solution. Thank you for explanation (reply to 30249)

Tiqan: Somehow if I test my code i do not see the dump even though i enabled debug in tact.config.json

Illia: do you use jest? (reply to 30329)

Tiqan: yep

Illia: Try npx jest --verbose --silent=false and also try to increase the value you attach to your message.  I had a similar issue recently. I found that dump consumes 0.06 TON on a simple receiver that forwards a message to another contract. (reply to 30339)

Illia: Make sure you add some enormous amount of tocoins to neglect your forwarding, storage and computing fees (reply to 30341)

Illia: This is an example of unit tests for my sandbox contract that I used to compare gas fees.  It has a handy printTransaction function at the bottom. It is my modified version of printTransactions function that provides better info on what has just happened.  The usage can be found in this file as well. (reply to 30339)

Illia: You can use this function to print actions caused by your transactions, see sources and destinations, and also totalFees per each. I found it very useful when debugging cross-contract calls and also that how I found out that dump takes too much fees. (reply to 30339)

Illia: npm create ton@latest + create a project with simple Tact counter  then go though tutorial tact-by-example and literalrly rewrite all the code into your project and try test it as much as possible  https://tact-by-example.org/00-hello-world  explore tact docs if you want to check if you don't understand some staff in tact-by-example or you wanna deepen your knoweldge  then probably ton docs and then whitepapers (reply to 30281)

Tiqan: i created a new one. put my contract in it and it still does not work

Tiqan: But with the Sample Counter it works

Illia: very nice (reply to 30548)

Illia: i just have 6 cross-contract calls and i'm afraid that if at least one fails for some unknown reason, then there's no way to rollback  i'm also concerned that if TON fails for some reason, e.g., the network is congested and all messages become bounced, then my system sucks as there's no way to rollback 6 cross-contract calls properly  of course, TON is reliable and scalable, but risks of failure still can be...

Dmitry: Depending on business logic you can also create a multiplier in the master contract (reply to 30253)

Illia: I've noticed that the printTransactionsFees() function from @ton/utils provides some actionCode. As I see, it's the resultCode of the actionPhase. The link you provided doesn't contain info about that or I don't see it. (reply to 30575)

Dmitry: It probably would also require a two step transfer transaction (reply to 30588)

Dmitry: Initiate tx Request master multiplier Receive it and then transfer

Ô∏èÔ∏èVlad: How in Tact inside init() block can we specify  more precise type (e.g. uint32) for int arguments?

Dmitry: You can write a revert yourself  It will revert on assignment to a state  var  You can create a struct with desirable int field (reply to 30608)

Tharun: export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {     const firstContract = provider.open(await FirstContract.fromInit(3306n));      await firstContract.send(         provider.sender(),         {             value: toNano('0.05'),         },         {             $$type: 'Deploy',             queryId: 0n,         }     );      await provider.waitForDeploy(firstContract.address);      // run methods on firstContract }  how to deploy this contract using mnemonics ? can anyone plz help me

Aibar: What language is the best to build defi smart contracts on ton?

Illia: No way to deploy though an existing mnemonic.   Your init must take your public key, in this way, it's derived using your mnemonics. Then you can modify the deploy receiver and provide initial values for your init.   Your current contract address is derived from some initial value you provide (your data) and the code of your contract. There is no link to you public key and, therefore, your mnemonics (reply to 30685)

Tharun: how to add the publickey can you send me some docs or examples code

Tharun: @pantemon

Illia: I don't think I have some code for Tact, but the idea behind is the same as for wallet contracts.  This is the simplest wallet on TON (V1)  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/wallet-code.fc  You can see that on the line 13, the public key is loaded from get data with seqno.  It's stored with contract init   So you can add init(publicKey: slice)   Then you can modify the deploy message so it sends the correct initial value for your contract.  Deploy { queryId, value }  You will need to remove Deployable trait  Then you receive deploy message, init everything completely, and then just do self.notify DeployOk  I hope you manage implement this. If you struggle, I can help you with the code later today (reply to 30702)

Illia: Depending on your requirements. The easiest way to start is, obviously, Tact. It has good docs, familiar syntaxes and auto-generates wrappers to interact with contracts. However, if you have some specific requests, such as update, that Tact doesn't support yet, or you want to optimize your contract aggressively, then it's probably still FunC.  Tact is like C, but FunC is like Assembly (it's not entirely correct comparison, but effective as it shows the difference from the developer experience point of view) (reply to 30695)

Aibar: We need someone with a strong understanding of ton smart contracts development to get a consultation. Can i dm you? (reply to 30707)

Behrang: I believe a better comparison would be this:  - Tact is like JavaScript - FunC is like C - Fift is like Assembly (reply to 30707)

Aibar: are you a ton developer? (reply to 30716)

Behrang: Yeah, but in FunC.

Ken: I think FunC is a lot more low level than C

Ken: and the FunC compiler doesn't do much optimization

Aibar: can i dm you? (reply to 30719)

Behrang: No, I disagree. I would say that with some syntax similarities like Ruby, it is a little easier than C.  It also has good enough optimizations. For more optimizations you can use Fift inside FunC, like writiing Assembly inside C.   The hard part is learning TVM. (reply to 30720)

Ken: The FunC compiler does a literal translation to Fift in most cases, and even trivial changes such as the order that you do multiple assignments can change the gas usage.

Behrang: I don't think that gas usage is any problem here. Ton fees are already low enough.   These optimization that you talk about, might only matter in competition between differet protocols.   And in that case, you still have options. (reply to 30728)

Ken: that's the definition of "optimization". If trivial changes in code result in different assembly code, then it means the compiler failed to properly optimize one of the two versions. (reply to 30729)

Behrang: This makes FunC predictable. I prefer to know what is going on behind the scene in smart contract development. (reply to 30731)

Dmitry: what do you mean saying "predictable" (reply to 30733)

Tharun: how to switch to testnet network in the wallet

Illia: if you're using Tonkeeper, click to settings and tap on the wallet's version until you get an option to switch to the dev mode. Then go and create a new wallet, but when creating it, specify that this is testnet wallet (reply to 30737)

Tharun: ohh okay thanks

unsphere: Can you give me a hint on how to extract the following values from the forward_payload slice in TokenNotification?  message ForwardPayload {     query_id: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     receivers: map<Int as uint16, Address>;     comment: String; }  in js i can get it like that:  const query_id = forwardPayload.loadUintBig(64); const amount = forwardPayload.loadCoins(); const receivers = Dictionary.load(Dictionary.Keys.Uint(16), Dictionary.Values.Address(), forwardPayload); const comment = forwardPayload.loadStringRefTail();  but how to do the same in tact?

Aish: Hey guys, new to ton.   I am creating a Jetton and a receiver contract in tact.  How can a contract receive jetton token and make sure that that the receiving contract is getting notified by the jetton created by me?  Also how can we add the metadata to a cell, what is the format for cell data in tact.

Behrang: "Ken M" said that it would be good that compiler optimizes code in such a way that small changes are automatically applied to improve gas usage.  This makes the generated code somehow unpredictable. After all, another "improved" code is generated and placed there, and I as a developer/reader/auditor cannot easily guess what Fift (assembly) code is generated behind the scenes. (reply to 30736)

Dmitry: and it does not make an error in trait code

Davis: I tried deploying Jetton and creating liquidity on Stonfi, but why is the pool only created with the minimum amounts of TON and TESTT?

Nerses: let builder = new Builder();             builder.storeStringTail(data);             const slice = builder.asSlice();             console.log(functionMap[result[0]](slice)); i changed code like this,but now i get invalid prefix is it possible storeStringTail can modify the string ? (reply to 30807)

Illia: Can I use accept_message with the internal message? What if I want to make a contract to pay for the transaction? Or it's valid for external messages only?

Dmitry: as i understand it: that is the case already (reply to 30864)

Dmitry: but you need gas to send tx from your wallet

Aleksandr: should work. (reply to 30864)

Illia: Minimum amounts of TON and TESTTT mean minimum amounts of tokens you can swap. It means that you cannot swap less than 0.00...1001 TON and you cannot swap less than 0.00...111611 TESTTTT (reply to 30823)

Dmitry: your wallet is the "culprit" (reply to 30876)

Dmitry: and, to say more, you should revert if you dont want such thing to happen (reply to 30864)

Illia: thanks for responses, your bets accepted, gentlemen; i'll build a demo and let you know the result

Dmitry: require(context.value >= txCommission, "pay the gas")

Illia: no, i don't mean this case, I mean the case when someone sends an internal transaction with let's say 0.001 TON, but to execute the receiver, it's needed, for example, 0.2 TON  so if i can do accept_message, can I refund 0.001 TON back to the sender and then process the rest of receiver using  i understand that this is the case for external messages, but is it possible if the message is internal? (reply to 30882)

Dmitry: it is the case (reply to 30883)

Dmitry: you automatically accept

Dmitry: and you CAN revert

Dmitry: if you want it to refund cash you can send a message (reply to 30883)

Dmitry: value: context.value;

Illia: i can revert, but if receiving the message costs 20 ton, but the sender attaches only 0.001 ton, transaction will be reverted isn't it? (reply to 30888)

Dmitry: (i guess youd better remove send remaining flag etc)

Dmitry: if your contract has 20 ton ‚Äî nope (reply to 30892)

Illia: hmmm (reply to 30894)

Dmitry: (and there is some thing about block size so imnot sure about unlimited gascost like 20 ton)

Illia: Is it possible to 'unimplement' BaseTrait from the contract?  I like forward, notify, reply, but I wanna change the way it calculates reserved amount of Toncoin so that the contract can collect fees for the owner (i wanna collect a small fee on each request to the contract, but the rest value of the message is passed next to another contract so it doesn't state at this contract)

Illia: thanks! (reply to 31138)

Illia: Can I break the foreach loop? Cause if I use return inside the foreach, it will stop my receiver?

Illia: I've also heard somewhat about local fee markets on the TON blockchain. Does it mean that if I will be sending lots of messages to a specific contract, the gas price for this contract will go up? Or am I mistaking this from other blockchains?

Narek: // this contract records the last 5 timestamps of when "timer" message was received contract Arrays {      const MaxSize: Int = 5;     arr: map<Int, Int>; // this is our array implemented with a map     arrLength: Int as uint8 = 0;     arrStart: Int as uint8 = 0; // our array is cyclic      init() {}      // push an item to the end of the array     fun arrPush(item: Int) {         if (self.arrLength < self.MaxSize) {             self.arr.set(self.arrLength, item);             self.arrLength = self.arrLength + 1;         } else {             self.arr.set(self.arrStart, item);             self.arrStart = (self.arrStart + 1) % self.MaxSize;         }     }      // iterate over all items in the array and dump them     fun arrPrint() {         let i: Int = self.arrStart;         repeat (self.arrLength) {             dump(self.arr.get(i)!!); // !! tells the compiler this can't be null             i = (i + 1) % self.MaxSize;         }     }      // record the timestamp when each "timer" message is received     receive("timer") {         let timestamp: Int = now();         self.arrPush(timestamp);     }      receive("dump") {         self.arrPrint();     }      get fun length(): Int {         return self.arrLength;     }      get fun map(): map<Int, Int> {         return self.arr;     } } (reply to 31937)

Nerses: yeah i think it would be great if i limitted my maps(as computation fees will be higher and higher) (reply to 31938)

Nerses: thanks a lot

Dmitry: pages/book/structs-and-messages.mdx // This Message overwrites its unique id with 0x7362d09c message(0x7362d09c) TokenNotification {     forwardPayload: Slice as remaining; } this syntax was not explained in the book

Dmitry: what does it mean tho :) (reply to 31957)

Dmitry: ‚Ä¢ am i obliged to define all the fields in "union" traits ( i want to create different interfaces and then merge them to write less when i will write realization). it seems like it ‚Ä¢ why cant i use "as uintx" in traits ‚Ä¢ is there a way to create abstract receivers / getters?

Dmitry: 1) like   trait IEntity with IAspect1, IAspect2; (reply to 31961)

Dmitry: why cant i use code blocks here

Dmitry: compilers makes me rewrite all the fields from nested traits into the outer one  trait ILol with IKek, IHeh {   // IKek   owner: Address;    // IHeh   addr: Address; }  so i cannot do just  trait ILol with IKek, IHeh;   or  trait ILOL with IKek, IHeh {}

Dmitry: 2. trait ILol {   number:  Int as uint8; } (reply to 31965)

Dmitry: 3.   trait ILol {   abstract get fun index(): Int; }  contract Kek with ILol {   [override] get fun index(): Int {     return 0;   } }     Overridden function "index" can not be a getter Line 53, col 3:   52 | contract Kek with ILol { > 53 |   override get fun index(): Int {          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   54 |     return 0;     or      Function "index" already exist in "Kek" Line 52, col 1:   51 |  > 52 | contract Kek with ILol {        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   53 |   get fun index(): Int { (reply to 31965)

Dmitry: absence of abstract receiver is sad...  receivers are the true interface for contract interaction so its kinda strange

Dmitry: Abstract function doesn't have abstract modifier Line 5, col 3:   4 | trait ILol { > 5 |   virtual get fun index(): Int;         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   6 | } (reply to 31973)

Dmitry: probably one can create abstract function and just invoke it in the receiver (reply to 31973)

Dmitry: ic. thanks. will try (reply to 31978)

Dmitry: also it turns out you cant do  contract Lol with AspectOuter {   override fun doSmth() {   } }  trait AspectOuter with AspectInner {   override fun doSmth(); }  trait AspectInner {   abstract fun doSmth(); }

Dmitry: or as it seems any permutation of such a concept    Overrides functions cannot be abstract Line 83, col 3:   82 | trait AspectOuter with AspectInner { > 83 |   override abstract fun doSmth();          ^~~~~~~~   84 | }      Abstract function doesn't have abstract modifier Line 83, col 3:   82 | trait AspectOuter with AspectInner { > 83 |   override fun doSmth();          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   84 | } (reply to 31984)

Dmitry: you probably can create a virtual one and override it (reply to 31994)

Dmitry: virtual fun lol(msg: Lolmsg) {require(false, "Not implemented") ;}

Anton: as of Tact v1.3 the traversed map needs to be a simple identifier like foo, so self.contracts is not going to work.  you can do  let c: map<‚Ä¶> = self.contracts; foreach (k, v in c) {  ‚Ä¶ } as a workaround.  We will lift this restriction in the next Tact release. Hopefully next week (reply to 31935)

Anton: check out Tact docs, our cookbook: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/data-structures#array (reply to 31937)

Nerses: i have a problem with parsing message. What to do if i get long string with api and dont know in what type of variable to store it (as it overflows) to load data from it bit by bit ? any hints or approaches ?

Dmitry: Function does not always return a result. Adding 'return' statement(s) should fix the issu e. Line 58, col 3:   57 |    > 58 |   virtual fun doSmth(args: DoSmthArgs): DoSmthRetVal { throw(200); }          ^~~   it seems to me that throws / requires should be treated like returns

Anton: requires cannot be treated as returns in general, because those throw on condition (reply to 32020)

Anton: thanks for your example

Dmitry: condition can be a constant  (i understand that there is a better way to use the developers' time) (reply to 32021)

Anton: yeah, but we don‚Äôt want to complicate the analysis with a special case like that :) (reply to 32023)

Dmitry: is it a bad idea to have dedicated structs/messages for each function to enforce bit length of ints?  fun doSmth(args: DoSmthArgs): DoSmthRetVal {}     Is there a plan for making args typed with formats? fun doSmth(x: Int as uint8) {}

Anton: nope, fun doSmth(x: Int as uint8) {} does not really make sense, because functions get their arguments from the TVM stack and all integers there are 257-bit ones (reply to 32025)

Dmitry: but runtime checks is still a thing (reply to 32027)

Dmitry: create a runtime check before every function call or smth  it can be suboptimal, but if one wants such a behaviour, he will be doing it ad hoc anyway

Dmitry: *every function call with such argument syntaxis (reply to 32031)

Anton: sure, this is what programming languages are for, to encode and enforce your own rules (reply to 32031)

Anton: if it can be done in the language and does not incur too much performance penalty then it should be done on the user side

Anton: otherwise we are going to have a huge language with too many special cases supported

Anton: @D_M1s5 btw, I opened an issue about throw that you mentioned before https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/421

Dmitry: is there a formatter for tact?

Anton: There are at least two: - the one builtin into Tact VS Code extension - https://github.com/microcosm-labs/tact-tools/tree/main/tactfmt (not sure if this one supports the latest features from Tact v1.3)  And the Tact team is working on our own formatter, but it‚Äôs not really ready yet (reply to 32038)

Dmitry: is it ok to have a map<Int as uint16, Cell> where keys are uint14 and cells are full loaded with no refs?   not "great", but ok )))  as far as i get it 2**14 = 16384 and it is less than 30k

Tiqan: does anyone know why a getter works in testnet and sandbox but not in mainnet?

Tiqan: we are currently testing our contract in mainnet and we get error 128 Null reference exception

Illia: yeah, take a look  This is an official tact guide on testing https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/debug  These are just links about blueprint if you want something extra https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/sdk/javascript (reply to 32087)

Tiqan: Is it possible that maps are not ready for mainnet yet?

Illia: maps are ready for mainnet, but are strongly not recommended as it's hard to predict the costs of gas fees for maps (they depend on the number of key-value pairs, load factor and lots of other factors) (reply to 32112)

Tiqan: What would be the alternative?

Illia: depending on what you want to achieve  if you wanna do nfts or jettons, then standards derive addresses of next indexes (reply to 32115)

Illia: it's like on solana, where you derive where to store the data

Quillen: Hi everyone, I've a trouble when get Jetton contract wallet address inside the smart contract. I'm using the Jetton contract from this source: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard, and I'm trying to get the Jetton wallet address from my contract. Here are the details:  In my contract, I get the wallet address with this code:   let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(msg.jettonAddress, myAddress()); let contractWallet: Address = contractAddress(init); dump("Master: "); dump(msg.jettonAddress); dump("Owner: "); dump(myAddress()); dump("contractWallet: "); dump(contractWallet);  However, when I read the data from the Jetton address, I get a different contract wallet, even though I use the same input for Master and Owner addresses:   virtual fun getJettonWalletInit(address: Address): StateInit {     let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), address);     let contractWallet: Address = contractAddress(init);     dump("Master: ");     dump(myAddress());     dump("Owner: ");     dump(address);     dump("contractWallet: ");     dump(contractWallet);      return initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), address); }   You can find more details and reproduce the issue by running the tests here: https://github.com/quocle108/ton-tact-test.

Quillen: did you find the answer? (reply to 31702)

Quillen: did you have the answer, i have the smae issue (reply to 26671)

Creator: You probably import contract wrapper from another dir. When we write contracts in Tact, when compiled, they are linked to the code of the contracts that we use. If you use this approach, then you need to import contracts from the same compiled folder. But if you want to use token contracts without being tied to the token code, and for example use jUSDT tokens, you can consider requesting the token address from the master contract in your contract. I did it like this:     send(SendParameters{             to: self.jetton_master, // sending message back to the sender             value: simple_message_request,              body: ProvideWalletAddress{                 query_id: 0,                 owner_address: myAddress(),                 include_address: false,             }.toCell(),         });   And do receiver like this:   receive(msg: TakeWalletAddress) {         let ctx: Context = context();         if (ctx.sender == self.jetton_master) {             self.jetton_wallet = msg.wallet_address;     } (reply to 32416)

andrew: Hey guys how you doing? I'm a total newbie here and just deployed my first mainnet contract, which send back all remaining ton back for every interaction. But the issue now is, every time it sends back fund with code 130 and bounce, what's wrong here? I tried everywhere even ChatGPT, still couldn't fix it after over a dozon deploys.... Anyone could help me please?

andrew: contract ProcessTransactions with Deployable {     deployer: Address;     const MinTonForStorage: Int = ton("0.004"); // enough for 1 KB of storage for 1 year      init() {         self.deployer = sender();         emit("Launched".asComment());     }      receive() {         let currentBalance:Int = myBalance();         let receivedValue:Int = context().value;         let minRequiredBalance:Int = self.MinTonForStorage;          emit("Your Ticket Punched".asComment());         emit(currentBalance.toString().asComment());         emit(receivedValue.toString().asComment());         emit(minRequiredBalance.toString().asComment());

andrew: // Ensure the contract retains enough balance for storage         let sendValue:Int = currentBalance - receivedValue - minRequiredBalance;                  if (sendValue > 0) {             send(SendParameters{                 to: sender(),                 bounce: true,                 value: sendValue,                 mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,                 body: "Hello, Astronaut!".asComment(), // comment (optional)             });         } else {             emit("Insufficient balance to send".asComment());         }     } }

andrew: I'll delete if this bothers you, sorry for any inconvenience...

Creator: Hi. Possible you fill the code or data cells incorrect. Or you deploy to bounced address.  how do you deploy? (reply to 32664)

andrew: I used "npx blueprint run" to deploy to mainnet

Creator: Invalid incoming message ‚Äî no suitable operation is found (reply to 32672)

Creator: Invalid op code

andrew: oh I send ton to the contract address, and that's wrong? lol

andrew: I should be just sending an empty message and it should work, if that's what you mean?

Creator: I don't know for sure, I need to dive deeper. But Im 130 code is invalid op code.  You can rewrite you  receive()  to  receive(msg: Deploy) and  try this approach

Creator: Also you can use testnet)

andrew: Thank you so much! I'll try it now! (reply to 32677)

Illia: 1. yes, that's how you can find already deployed contracts from Init (if you don't know the address)  2. no, as it's already deployed (reply to 32633)

Illia: that's a good question, I think yes, don't see a reason why not, i've recently laucnhed mine in testnet, I'm going to launch mine in the mainnet next month (reply to 32660)

Illia: There are different stages when executing contracts with TVM.  Some of them are the compute phase and the action phase.  In your code, when it's executed, it's in the compute phase. The action of sending a message is recorded in the c5 register containing actions. Then you delete something from the contract dictionary and decrement its length.  The action itself is sent after the compute phase, hence it's sent after you update your storage.  However, if you will be sending 2 messages where each message has the mode SendRemainingBalance, then the first message will send all the remaining balance and the second one will just send 0 (because you have already decided to send all the remaining balance with the first message)  There are more info on TVM phases on the following page:  https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview (reply to 32695)

Nerses: the problem is that in send I use some data from the dicitionary which is deleted further. So I guess it is deleted before the send and as ther is no data transaction isnt done. Am i right ? (reply to 32701)

jay: I was aware that Tact would compile to Func, but I had concerns about the compiler's stability. (reply to 32697)

Nerses: how can i 'force' compiler to do certain line of the code in the end of all computations ?

Illia: Tact has evolved a lot since the first announcement was published; if that's something critical, then I think it's still better to write in FunC; but if your ultimate goal is quick 0 to 1, then Tact is great;   For example, I managed to build within a week a contract system of 3 with Tact; building such a system with FunC would take me at least month...

Stuart: how do i get the balance of an address from my test suite?

Stuart: Example

Stuart: do you do development work for other people? looking for dev partners (reply to 32728)

Illia: Do you have a bug with that?  It should not work as you describe, to my knowledge. That's because you compute what to send when your dictionary still has data that you delete later. The action is sent later, but what to send is calculated before you delete the data. (reply to 32702)

Illia: Can you elaborate on that? As far as I am concerned no event can execute some code after each received message. If you're focused on receivers, then you can write a wrapper around the send function so that it executes some action every time you send a message (reply to 32714)

Dmitry: how does "init" maps into func code?  some builtins don't work in init block  myAddress initOf

Nerses: i wanted some solution because of previously described problem.I thought it will be fixed if i force compiler to delete the dicitionary data in the end.I have sent message with higher amount now it succedede but before it it neither failed nor succeded.I should do some more tests oon it (reply to 32735)

Illia: const contract = await blockchain.getContract(address); console.warn(contract.balance); (reply to 32729)

Illia: i do part-time, DM me if you have specific request (reply to 32732)

Illia: I have contract called Broker  If you build your contract and then explore its code, you can find the following:  slice $broker = $global_contractAddress(($brokerStateInit'code, $brokerStateInit'data));  this is what contractAddress compiles for.  initOf is compiled into:  var ($brokerStateInit'code, $brokerStateInit'data) = $Broker$_init_child(__tact_context_sys, my_address(), $response'stream);  Instead of $Broker$ you will have $<YourContractName>$ (reply to 32738)

Illia: Oh I see, gas is such a tricky one to handle.  I have a nice logger, which helps me debug my contracts, I shared it before with some members of that chat and will upload it later today so it will be easier for you to debug your contracts (reply to 32739)

Nerses: it would be great.thanks a lot (reply to 32753)

Stuart: this works for things that arent contracts too? (reply to 32749)

Stuart: because im trying to get the collection owners balance, not the collection contract

Illia: Ultimately, treasury is a contract (Treasury Contract). The collection's owner is defined as treasury in your tests. Therefore, my code snippet works for your case as well because it gets balance of an arbitrary contract, including  Treasury Contract (reply to 32760)

lin: How can TACT obtain the address of the current contract

Stuart: send me the code (reply to 32798)

Stuart:  let nft_init: StateInit = self.getNftItemInit(self.next_item_index);         send(SendParameters{                 to: contractAddress(nft_init),                  value: msgValue,                  bounce: false,                 mode: SendIgnoreErrors,                 body: Transfer {                     query_id: 0,                     new_owner: sender,                     response_destination: self.owner_address,                     custom_payload: self.collection_content,                     forward_amount: 0,                     forward_payload: emptySlice()                 }.toCell(),                 code: nft_init.code,                 data: nft_init.data             });

Stuart: because i think you can just do soemthing like this

Stuart: contractAddress(nft_init)

Stuart: Does tact have plans at abstracting the send(SendParameters)) paradigm into something that feels more like a function call?

Stuart: Its really verbose and redundant

Aleksandr: But it is not a function call in any wayüòÄ (reply to 32803)

Stuart: Sure but youre sending messages to things that recieve those messages

Stuart: and then process them

Stuart: in a lot of ways, it 'feels' the same as a public function in solidity

Stuart: which is basically doing the same thing, albeit synchronously

Stuart: Like this has three sends that are essentially doing RPC on another contract

Andrew: Hi, I'm from solidity and have a question. When I sent a transaction, how do I get the information? In the transaction, I create a deal and define an ID. HOW do I get this ID?  In solidity, the method could return this value to me, but how to do it on the TACT?  Thx

MyName: You can implement a getter fun and track the differense at init state i think, idk (reply to 32937)

Andrew: as an option But if there will be many users, then I need a lot of checks to find exactly his transaction (reply to 32939)

Vitor: Send the message, have the contract process the message, "emit a log", use indexer to get the difference. (reply to 32937)

Vitor: Also, don't do unbounded state, TVM is fairly different from the EVM.

Vitor: What is a sensible contract design on the EVM might not be on the TVM.

Vitor: See the Jetton design for a comparison.

MyName: Btw, is there analogue of initOf in Solidity? (reply to 32943)

Vitor: Triple quote tact new line code here triple code will format it properly:-D

Vitor: You send the message. It's async. Then you check for the side effects.

Andrew: it's a bit difficult for me to adjust)  I sent, "await" is waiting for execution and I see a large response object. However, there is no message body 'body: self.lastId,' (reply to 32951)

Vitor: Await will wait for the first message in the chain, not for the entire execution. Messaging passing is not a function call. Watch a transaction go through on Tonviewer. Your message "returns" but execution barely began. Sorry, I'm a bit tired and not that clear, I know

Andrew: I`m undersand, thx  I added an emit and saw a new object in the res.externals. I understand that this is what I transferred to the emit, but the format of the cell? How I can format to string (any human format) (reply to 32958)

Vitor: In JS? https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/cookbook#writing-comments-long-strings-in-snake-format (reply to 32960)

Andrew: yep  If this is a test and I want to check the result. Isn't there any native way to get the string? (reply to 32961)

Vitor: That's the native way so far, take the cell, convert to string. DevEx on TON is not on post with Ethereum tbh. Tact is a massive leap forward from FunC, but testing tooling etc ain't as nice. (reply to 32962)

Anton: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/debug (reply to 32996)

Frances: Hi, guys!, in ton ecosystem, is there equivalent of "subgraph" for data indexing?

Stuart: so as i understand, ctx.value is the total value of the message, right?

Stuart: unlike in solidity where there is gas, which is value, and value, which is value but not used for computation

Stuart: in tact the two values are together in one

Stuart: yes?

Stuart: so i have to pull out the compute fees from the message value if im, lets say, running an nft auction and want to make sure that the message has 1 ton minus the compute fees before minting an nft

Stuart: Cool that‚Äôs what I thought

Stuart: How do I extract the fees?

For every deployment of tonkeeper, mytonwallet or tonhub, the testnet of wallets gives an invalid address error. I activated the wallets and sent testnet ton there. What could it be related to?

Vitor: Look at message modes and flags to handle fees being sent and the remainder being returned: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/messages#message-modes. If you actually need the _numerical_ value of used compute in that point in time, I'm not sure you have it available during compute phase (since action phase costs would not be calculated at that point in time) (reply to 33057)

Stuart: interesting (reply to 33063)

Stuart: thanks

Stuart: i think ill go thru the ton academy videos to understand the architecture more

Stuart: like i get what tact is doing, but i need more to understand the lower level of whats happening

Stuart: also whats with all these structs and messages that are just reencapsulations of the structs

Stuart: i feel like tact could make the recieve / message flow much more like RPC

Vitor: https://stepik.org/course/176754/promo it's a good dive into the TVM. (reply to 33068)

Stuart: already there lol

Vitor: Yeah, Tact is a million times better than FunC, but it definitely could be even better.

Stuart: agreed

Stuart: i wish it was a bit more like a regular language, abstracting out some of the common design patterns that i see

Stuart: like send(sendParameters())

Stuart: i feel like this could be much more like an RPC call / function call while still informing the developer that its a message going out

Vitor: To be honest the code base is not hard to understand and Anton and the team are quite open to PRs. If you have a suggestion, maybe propose it as a issue on GitHub?

Stuart: Good idea

Stuart: i wrote a python smart contracting language in my last startup

Stuart: so hopefully they take me seriously hahahhaha

Vitor: Targeting the EVM? Vyper-ish?

Stuart: https://github.com/lamden/contracting

Stuart: sandboxed python

Vitor: Ah, the dudes are fine. I had zero experience contributing to compilers before and they are always nice enough to review my PRs.

Vitor: There is a dead project out there for doing Python -> FunC, I can't recall the name. I'd also enjoy a more Pythonic language.

Stuart: agreed

Stuart: i mean tact isnt horrible

Stuart: there are just some annoying parts

Stuart: and the testing framework for ton is really annoying as well

Stuart: imo most of the concepts that are unique to ton should be abstracted and made to 'feel' like a regular language while still giving the gaurentees that ton gives you

Stuart: if there were a few abstractions in tact, it would be perfect because its really clear and clean for the most part

Vitor: Yeah... I have been looking into an open source project to contribute, the more I hang around, the more I think a *good* testing framework might be best way to make an impact into the ecosystem. (reply to 33092)

Stuart: i would be interested in helping out there

Stuart: i also wrote my testing framework

Stuart: you could write shit in python and test it in the same file

Vitor: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/210 is the way to go for unit test, IMHO. (reply to 33099)

Stuart: this would be dope

Stuart: kind of like foundry forge for solidity

A: guys, quick question. If I am making any contract should I care to maintain it‚Äôs positive balance on this blockchain? I mean I heard that contract pays for it‚Äôs own storage on a subscription basis and then it has no balance it would be removed from the blockchain?

Stuart: @vitorpyb do i just take a pr out for tact or is there an ERC type proposal scheme

Vitor: I don't think there's an EIP-like system yet for Tact (there's TEP for the core code). I would just draft an issue and wait for feedback before coding a PR. (reply to 33105)

Vitor: Yes, there's the equivalent of "state rent" and smart contracts have to pay for storage costs. (reply to 33104)

Dmitry: is there a reason btw? (reply to 33308)

Vitor: "forward_payload" replaces the transferFrom mechanics, indirectly. It's the expectation the owner will trigger the change, but a subsequent contract interaction can be made, instead of the owner triggering a contract that triggers the transfer on the owner's behalf. (reply to 33309)

Vitor: Both have operands, https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions, but I'm not sure the Tact standard library encapsulates those already. If it doesn't, you can write a little FunC and call it from Tact - there's an example in the Cookbook. (reply to 33319)

I‚Äôm just starting to study this area, and everything I learn will be shared in my channel.  I hope this will turn out to be an excellent tutorial on developing on the Ton blockchain from scratch (since I'm starting from scratch right now).  If you would like to join me on this journey, please let me know.  I don't want to advertise here.

Howard: Let me check (reply to 33246)

lin: How to place an empty address in storeAddress

lin: In JS SDK, it looks like this e.bits.writeAddress( void 0)

fa: Hello everyone, tell me, can I find out the address of the owner of the smart contract?

Nerses: I have created contract which message has different type fields like Int , Address or Map. Is serialization of message deterministic ? I mean that in messages of the same type, fields are stored at the same bit position in each Cell.

Nerses: for eexample if i have such message message Hello {     hi: Int;     hello: Address;     goodDay: map<Int,Int>; }   and in serialization field hello ends at bit x will goodDay start at x+1 bit ? Or how they will be stored ?

Anton: Tact produces a compilation report in .md format, you can check the TLB schemes in it. That will tell you how your data is organized (reply to 33363)

Nerses: TLB: `hello#aef3a620 hi:int257 hello:address goodDay:dict<int, int> = Hello` Signature: Hello{hi:int257,hello:address,goodDay:dict<int, int>}

Anton: yep

Nerses: but still it doesnt tell at which position of bit will start every field (reply to 33369)

Anton: it does (reply to 33370)

Anton: check out the docs on tlb

Nerses: is this the appropriate matreial ? https://docs.ton.org/develop/data-formats/tl-b-language (reply to 33372)

Nerses: i read the doc but still cant figure out for example at what bit will start  goodDay . Could you please give any hint ? (reply to 33372)

Maxim: Hi, anybody have script to generate Cell with JettonContent or example of generation

Dmitry: There are online generators of jettons (reply to 33377)

Tiqan: Does anyone have any idea, why my contract works in testnet but not in mainnet?

Nick: anyone have any contracts for trading TON DNS? is TON DNS just a jetton ?

Mirka: Ton dns is just a nft (reply to 33393)

Nick: So it‚Äôs different from a Jetton ?

Mirka: It's not a jetton, it's nft (reply to 33395)

Nick: Do you have any contracts with interacting with NFTs I can look at

.: Guys how much money do i need to get my own jetton?

Max: Try https://foton.sh/ ‚Äì there is a tutorial for React (reply to 33441)

Nerses: is there any example how to parse dictionary using libs in ts ?

·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†: Hello there! I encountered a problem that after building a contract, blueprint deploys the same contract to the same address, does anyone know how to fix it?

Dmitry: How it should work in your opinion (reply to 33449)

·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†: I think that after rebuilding the contract, blueprint should deploy the new contract (reply to 33453)

Nerses: In what data type of TACT i can store map ?

Dmitry: If you haven't change your contract the result of the build will be the same, hence the same address (reply to 33454)

·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†: I changed it, but the result is the same (reply to 33459)

Illia: Try deleting the rebuild, build again and see the result (reply to 33462)

Illia: There is a folder called build (reply to 33462)

Illia: Can you describe the use case? Ultimately, the map is the dict and the dict is represented as cell (reply to 33455)

·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†·Ö† ·Ö†: Ok, i will try

Nerses: I try to parse message which consist of different fields such as map. So for it I tried maually to store map and load data from it (reply to 33465)

Illia: I haven't seen if it's possible to store maps in messages, but I guess it should be possible.  What is your map size? Do you want to use this in production or just as a fun project? (reply to 33467)

Nerses: I stored it succefully,but problems occured trying to parse that data. It will be production code (reply to 33468)

Nerses: In docs it is stated that during compilation is generated ts file which can be used for example there are load store for messages of contract

Illia: I reckon it's not possible yet. I haven't seen such syntax in the docs or somewhere in the recent announcements.  You may try using native functions from FunC to interact with your dict as a cell in the Tact contract (reply to 33469)

Nerses: But the main problem is that loadSomeMssg accepts as argument Slice while data is too long to be stored in Slice

Illia: Yes, that's true. Do you want to parse your dict in Tact or in TypeScript? (reply to 33470)

Nerses: I want to parse in Type Script, but as it was useless i tried to store some message and load data using compilation ts functions just for understandi9gn why it doesnt work (reply to 33474)

Illia: If TypeScript is the case, then there is a special type of Dictionary. This is used for maps.  If you send your code, preferably as a GitHub repository, I may try to help you with your problem and write some code that does the job.  Or send you a link to the relevant part of documentation. (reply to 33470)

Nerses: if you dont mind I will dm you to describe in detail the problem (reply to 33476)

üÖ∞üÜÇüÜÉüÖæüÜÅüÑ≥üÑ¥üÖÖ: Thanks (reply to 33443)

üÖ∞üÜÇüÜÉüÖæüÜÅüÑ≥üÑ¥üÖÖ: Yes, you can store the map, but with an unpredictable map length, consider implementing parent-child contract schemes. https://tact-by-example.org/04-maps https://tact-by-example.org/06-parent-child. (reply to 33455)

Nerses: thanks a lot (reply to 33481)

Dhruv: hello devs, can anyone please help me here, how to wait till send transaction is completed? The storeOnDB function gets called after sending the send transaction but i want it to call after the send transaction is executed, how can i make it possible.   const mintPost = async (data) => {         if (!postContractInstance) return;          const res = await postContractInstance.send(             sender,             {                 value: parseTon("0.05")             },             {                 $$type: 'Mint',                 query_id: BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)),             }         ).then(async () => {             await storeOnDB(data);         });     }

Viacheslav: Hey guys, what‚Äôs the best way to send multiple messages in a single go without usin PayGasSeparately mode?

Illia: use mode: 0 + attach some value like 0.005  then do nativeAcceptMessage() on the receiving contract after validating that the sender is someone you trust and expect getting notification from  or simply provide more value (you may want to ask the recipient of the notification to pay some toncoins in advance) (reply to 33521)

Illia: You may want to do something like that:  https://github.com/VanishMax/foton/blob/b33f2daf446456f76deb2aa7235c161cd3df1b97/packages/core/src/public/wait-for-transaction.ts#L19 (reply to 33519)

Illia: Harvard's free CS50 online course is the best option for that (reply to 33515)

Viacheslav: but if it‚Äôs not enough? e.g. for TokenTransfer and I have to manage everything manually? is it possible to SendRemainingValue at the end? (reply to 33522)

Illia: if you do accept_message on the receiving contract, you set the gas limit of the current (incoming) transaction to the balance of your contract  therefore, when receiving the notification, you agree to pay for it using your own contract balance  by default, the gas limit is incoming message value / gas price  0.005 should be enough for the average transaction + call accept_message (reply to 33525)

Illia: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/accept (reply to 33525)

Viacheslav: and to send multiple I just use multiple send or pack them in a single body?

Illia: you need to find the optimum value by youself; if you transfer simple message with query_id int as u64; then even 0.002 toncoins can be enough (considering current gas price stays the same and you call native_accept as soon as your receive begins) (reply to 33526)

Illia: you just call send() as many times as you want  you can do it in the for-loop, for example (reply to 33528)

Illia: we're talking about sending messages inside the contracts, right?  cause it's slightly different if we're talking about sending messages using TON Connect (reply to 33528)

Viacheslav: So this should work, but it fails with 708 exit code..   send(SendParameters{                     to: ctx.sender,                     value: ton("0.03"),                     mode: SendIgnoreErrors,                     bounce: false,                     body: TokenTransfer{                         queryId: 0,                         amount: someTokenAmount,                         destination: self.owner,                         response_destination: msg.from,                         custom_payload: null,                         forward_ton_amount: 0,                         forward_payload: emptyCell().asSlice()                     }.toCell()                 }             );              send(SendParameters{                     to: ctx.sender,                     value: ton("0.03"),                     mode: SendIgnoreErrors,                     bounce: false,                     body: TokenTransfer{                         queryId: 0,                         amount: tokenAmount,                         destination: msg.from,                         response_destination: msg.from,                         custom_payload: null,                         forward_ton_amount: 0,                          forward_payload: emptyCell().asSlice()                      }.toCell()                 }             );             send(SendParameters{                     to: msg.from,                     value: 0,                     mode: SendRemainingValue | SendIgnoreErrors,                     bounce: false,                     body: ‚ÄúSome text!‚Äù.asComment()                 }             );

Viacheslav: only tokentransfer fails, third one is ok

Illia: 708 is not the standard exit code; the contract you send this too throws this error code; you need to have a look when your destination contract throws this error (reply to 33532)

Viacheslav: it‚Äôs just basic jetton deployed with minter

Illia: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-wallet.fc#L66 (reply to 33535)

Illia: based on this code, it expects the message you sending to have body, but you're sending a message with empty body (reply to 33535)

Illia: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (reply to 33534)

Illia: ‚è≥ Compiling...   > Broker: tact compiler    > Broker: func compiler Func compilation error: /home/pantemon/nenuma/packages/contracts/build/Brokerage/tact_Broker.headers.fc:190:209: error: formal parameter name expected instead of `type`   ... n_expiration_type_investment_payout(slice holder, slice writer, int initiation, int expiration, int type, int investment, int payout) inline;  Does it mean that type is a reserved word in Tact?  I've built a contract that accepts the Agreement struct with the type field. It works fine in the testnet.   But now I'm trying to instantiate an object of that struct in the contract and I'm simply getting pissed off by the compiler.  UPD. I've just refactored all my code that there's no type field anymore. As a result, I have no errors.  If that's a reserved word, then cool, but we need to make sure that the user is not limited inside structs, or, at least show this error earlier, when the first compilation takes place. I've also never seen any type parameter in FunC. Is it some extra from Tact?

Anton: can you share a minimal Tact example, please? (reply to 33563)

Rashid: Howdy! Thrilled to join such a community and the first question is: - Going forward, is Tact going to be a preferred way to develop Smart Contracts on TON? - Is there anything Tact won't be able to do that I will have to use FunC for?  Thanks

Illia: Wow, that's great news! Thanks for your quick response to my issue. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to produce the example for your earlier, but it seems like you managed to do that by yourself. (reply to 33634)

Illia: Welcome, Rashid!  It's difficult to answer your question because it contains 'is going to be'. I'm sure it will substitute FunC completely one day. But it's yet to happen. For building proofs of concept, it's already great. My development time decreased a lot (I reckon it increased at least 4 times). I would spend like 2 months rather than 2 weeks on what I have built now. If you need to use FunC, you can simply call FunC code from Tact using native functions. Therefore, the answer to your question depends on what you want to build. If something is 0-to-1 and maybe beyond, Tact is already preferred. If you require aggressive optimizations and complex engineering, then I would prefer FunC today, but, as Tact gets better, I will switch to Tact.  Well, now, I will address the next question. As of now, Tact compiles directly into FunC. Therefore, if FunC can do something, you can do it Tact. You may even write some custom code in FunC and call it from Tact üëÄ As long as Tact is compliable into FunC, you will have no trouble. But in the future, Tact is going to be compiled directly into Fift (that's the language for manipulating the TVM stack like the Forth programming language). I think, once this milestone is achieved, the developers of Tact will make sure that Tact can do the same spectre of tasks as FunC. (reply to 33670)

Illia: I was about to record my project's demo video for the hackathon.  But my teammate made a commit just before that. It installed Tact 1.4.0 into our project.  As a result, our tests stopped working and we also started getting mysterious errors on newly deployed contracts to the testnet.

Illia: https://github.com/dreamqip/nenuma  That's our project's repo. The contracts are in /packages/contracts  We're going to downgrade to the previous version of Tact as of now. We haven't committed a downgraded version yet (reply to 33716)

Illia: Some integer overflow now occurs, but I have no idea whether it was an error in Tact in the past, and hence my tests are wrong, or that's just a fresh bug from the latest release (reply to 33716)

Son Pin: any comparion of tact and func in deep level

Anton: So basically the issue is in the storageReserve constant. Here you declare it as a variable (which the typechecker misses, we will fix that), what you really need to do is to say it like this:  override const storageReserve: Int = ton("0.01‚Äù);   You‚Äôll have to do it like this, because defining constants in terms of other constants is not possible now, but will be in the next Tact feature release (reply to 33720)

Anton: well, you didn‚Äôt provide any detail. what did you try? what have you got? what result did you expect? where is your code? (reply to 33789)

Haris: Here is my code:   receive(msg: Mint) {         require(sender() == self.owner, "Unauthorized");         // dump("start");         let init: StateInit = self.walletInit(self.owner);         let wallet: Address = contractAddress(init);         // dump(wallet);         send(SendParameters{             to: contractAddress(init),             body: InternalAdd{amount: self.totalSupply, origin: myAddress()}.toCell(),             value: ton("0.03"),             mode: SendIgnoreErrors,             code: init.code,             data: init.data         });         // dump("end");     }       get fun walletInit(owner: Address): StateInit {         return initOf JettonWallet(myAddress(), owner);     }      get fun walletAddress(owner: Address): Address?{               let initCode: StateInit = self.walletInit(owner);         return contractAddress(initCode);     }

Haris: Mint transaction giving me no error but when i tried to get balance from child contract it is giving me error:   Trying to run get method on non-active contract

Anton: It‚Äôs still unclear how you test it

Haris: there is no rocket science in it i am trying to make nft collection which initiate the JettonMaster contract and that JettonMaster should initiate jettonWallet contract

Haris: but i think JettonMaster is not able to deploy or initiate the JettonWallet contract

Stuart: guys question

Stuart: I'm writing a game that pays out

Stuart: if(!self.has_started) {             require(myBalance() >= self.prize_value, "Not enough balance to start");             self.has_started = true;         }

Stuart: heres my code

Stuart: pretty simple. in my tests, i set the prize value to 1 ton

Stuart: when the game ends, i send a payout with this function

Stuart: fun pay(recipient: Address, value: Int) {         send(SendParameters{             to: recipient,             value: value,             bounce: false,             mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors         });     }

Stuart: self.pay(self.current_winner, self.prize_value);

Stuart: like this

Stuart: i have a test that runs thru the game, and then hits the play function again

Stuart: which automatically restarts the game

Stuart: but it should fail because it doesnt have enough balance

Stuart: however, its not failing. when i output the balance variable, its not changing, even though the past winner is getting creditted

Stuart: any thoughts?

Illia: can u upload your code on github?  try nativeThrowUnless instead of require (i found its easier to debug)

Tom - Bushi: when writing tests how can I check the reason for a reversal of a transaction? like how can I see if this require statement was failed?  require(ctx.value >= spentOnTickets, "Not enough funds sent");

Stuart: yo are there docs for that (reply to 33927)

Stuart: and my codes on github but its private

Anton: is it because the exit code is obvious from the code? (unlike with require which hashes the error string into an exit code)? (reply to 33927)

Illia: Yes, exactly. I've written a custom logger (shrek-logger)  It's inside utils.ts at the nenuma repository.  It shows the exit code as a number. If I get some errors, I then just go to the code and can precisely track what's the problem.  If I have a hashed string, that's quite not intuitive.  I create constants that represent error codes so that it's also easy for me to navigate around the code.  However, it also adds lots of boilerplate. Unfortunately, there's no way to export constants yet (or I just haven't found them in the exports). (reply to 33946)

Anton: this sounds awesome! I haven‚Äôt looked yet, but is it possible to integrate it with blueprint directly or refactor it as a separate package and plug into blueprint? (reply to 33947)

i: DM find a teamm8

Illia: That would be great. I will create a new repo later today. It would be amazing if you could take a look and provide some feedback on how to improve it.

shereMeshchain.Aiüå±SEEDüêçüîµ ONUS: hi

shereMeshchain.Aiüå±SEEDüêçüîµ ONUS: Hello everybody how are you

shereMeshchain.Aiüå±SEEDüêçüîµ ONUS: Can i ask some question

Illia: The answer to your question very much depends on the length of your string.  Fift (the language for manipulating the TVM stack; Tact compiles into FunC and Func compiles into Fift) uses UFT-8 for strings. It means that each character can be 8 bits (1 byte), 16 bits (2 bytes), 24 bits (3 bytes), or 32 bits (4 bytes). Chinese characters require more than 1 byte to store.  Therefore, a string 'Hello, World!' takes 13 bytes or 13 * 8 = 104 bits. That's how much storage you need.   The function sha256 in Tact calls the SHA256U opcode under the hood. It returns a 256-bit unsigned integer x.  https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions#:~:text=F902-,SHA256U,-s%20%2D%20x  Therefore, if your string size is <= 256 bits, that's reasonable to store the value as a string. But, if it's longer than that, it's better to use sha256 as you only need to check if the strings match. Obviously, you won't be able to restore the original value from such a hash.  I have to double-check that you pay fees just for the bits you use or for the number of cells you use. Could anyone elaborate on that and supply a relevant link to the documentation?  If you pay just for the number of bits you use, then the limits are the same as I described above. If you pay for the number of cells, then it's reasonable to use sha256 if you have a string that takes more then 1023 bits. (reply to 33970)

Illia: The process of estimating fees for external messages should be the same as for internal messages.  I have a great example of how to calculate fees for transferring and burning jettons.  https://verifier.ton.org/EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs#:~:text=()%20check_amount_is_enough_to_transfer(,))%3B%0A%7D  That's the source code of the USDT contract on the TON Blockchain. You can write such functions in FunC and then bridge them into Tact. (reply to 33964)

Aish: Hi everyone, Is it possible to write test cases using blue print for a set of asynchronous transactions?  Here is the scenario,  There is contract A and a user 1. The user 1 makes a transaction to contract A and which makes further transcations in response.  Here is the txn flow:  1 -> A -> B ->C -> A  Is it possible to create test cases using blueprint for the entire transaction flow( as the transactions are asynchronous), like if a transaction at C bounces, can we know it from blueprint test cases?

Illia: Yes, that's very possible. You may take a look at how I test action chains at nenuma.  https://github.com/dreamqip/nenuma/tree/main/packages/contracts  If you want to check if transactions bounced, then u need to add bounced: true (if I'm not mistaken) and/or success: false in your toHaveTransaction pattern (reply to 34053)

Truong: hello guys, Please help me look at this contract, why is the total score still 0 when I stake tokens? It seems that TokenNotification is not working properly

Illia: i don't see how you add/subtract stakes tokens; based on this code, you just record the amount transfered (that's doesn't sound like staking)  one possibility is that you don't have enough gas coming with you notification to execute your complex hendler  try logging the contract in the tests with with https://www.npmjs.com/package/@henchtab/shrek  it will show you -14 exit code if you try to send jetton in your tests with specifying the sender   There're 2 options you can do;  the first one is to set higher forward_ton_amount  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md#:~:text=forward_ton_amount%20%2D%20the%20amount%20of%20nanotons%20to%20be%20sent%20to%20the%20destination%20address.  that's the value in toncoins that comes with your notification   the second one is to call nativeAcceptMessage(); you have to write a binding from FunC's stdlib for this one,  https://github.com/dreamqip/nenuma/blob/f2ec7c03fcb1f365234e4db7ff702a7487a5b925/packages/contracts/contracts/subscriber.tact#L3  That's how i did it in nenuma  if you call this function after authorizing that the sender is the right contract, then your contract will pay for this transfer from its balance  https://github.com/dreamqip/nenuma/blob/f2ec7c03fcb1f365234e4db7ff702a7487a5b925/packages/contracts/contracts/subscriber.tact#L204 (reply to 34057)

Cake: Is have any erc721 or erc1155 examples?

Cake: I want to know more about ECDSA usage

Illia: ERC is a non-EVM chain; there's no erc721 and erx1155 tokens  TON uses it's own standard TEP-74 for Jettons (it's like ERC-20 but better) and NFT standard is TEP-62 (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md) (reply to 34082)

Matthew: I have checked null elements in the map, but I can't access the data in it

Illia: You can check ECDSA signatures using the check_signature function in FunC's stdlib (Tact may have its handy implementation as well; check the docs)  You may write some binding for FunC in Tact (reply to 34083)

Cake: Thanks

Illia: Package is possibly null  You cannot access any properties on the null object   You need to explicitly state that the value is not null  Try package!!.endTime  But make sure it's not null  The type for endTime is also just Int; it's not defined as maybe null in your struct (reply to 34088)

Matthew: self.packages.get(packageId) != null but i have check it before (reply to 34091)

Illia: That's great, but Tact is yet to support the feature that will automatically infer that the result is not null.  As of now, you must always add !! (reply to 34092)

Matthew: do  you have any example for  ECDSA signatures, i need presign for user on backend,  and verify signature on smartcontract

Illia: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math#checkdatasignature  that's the best option available (reply to 34094)

Matthew: thank you

Anton: so, shrek is like a better version of @ton/test-utils? (reply to 34052)

Illia: Yes, that's like a library that has features that I didn't find in the @ton/test-utils, but I found them very useful when developing smart contracts for Nenuma.   There is a function in @ton/test-utils called something like printTransactionFees and it was so confusing. It was a nightmare debugging contracts with it.   I saw lots of random fees and now idea what transaction action is failing, where this message is, etc.  I was once debugging a set of transactions that was causing 13 actions. One of my transactions was bouncing as I hadn't attached enough value to pay for the gas fees.  I spent a few hours writing expects and then just gave up and implemented a function called printTransactions. It was printing simplified fees and was showing me sources and destinations of my actions.  Then I realized that it would be good to have some labels and log contract balances from time to time. That's how I created a logger.  There's a feature in the sandbox that the first transaction was like an external transaction that brings some value. It didn't have source address and values could be null sometimes.  I was rewatching Shrek with my friend that day so I just started generating some funny ogre-style info in my console.  That's pretty much who the Shrek was born :)) (reply to 34097)

Illia: I'm currently exploring how to set up a local environment like Hardhat:  https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview  The console logger is great, but imagine if we had a graphical interface like Tonviewer that shows action flows with dynamic charts. That would be a game-changer for TON development.  Unlike other blockchains, where you don't have to track tons of transactions, TON's async nature makes it super easy to get lost. Plus, architecting contracts to be scalable, like Jetton wallets or NFTs, is really tough to debug. (reply to 34099)

Illia: There are no oracles on TON as of now.   I'm developing one right now for the real-time on-chain market data.   https://dorahacks.io/buidl/13423  Although it's available on the testnet already, it's not ready for production yet.  I'm planning to launch it by the end of Q3 if everything goes well  So if you need some real-time market data, I'll update you once Nenuma is launched (reply to 34100)

Vitor: There is. Stork Network supports TON and that's what Storm Trade uses. I couldn't find a reference on the website but their sales people did confirm the availability. (reply to 34102)

Illia: wow; that's very nice to know; thanks mate; will check what they have (reply to 34105)

Illia: Thanks everyone for providing useful links to think about. I'll explore their code to see how to make it better

Dmitry: What can be the reason for such an error?

Dmitry: i found the probable reason:  it is {} block

Dmitry: like  fun lol() {    let a: Int = 0;    {      let b: Int = 10;   }  }

Anton: yeah, nested blocks are not supported yet https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/362 (reply to 34112)

Dmitry: Cannot reduce expression to a constant integer  const Lol:  Int = -10; const Kek: Int = -Lol;

Illia: It's yet to be supported as well (reply to 34117)

Anton: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/229 (reply to 34117)

Anton: will be supported in Tact v1.5

Dmitry: what is the work around (reply to 34125)

Dmitry: like do it in two steps?

Dmitry: ic

Dmitry: why doesn't it break on tact compilation stage  and whats the reason behind chaining removing (reply to 34125)

Dmitry: thx. but not doin it here (reply to 34133)

Dmitry: can you try to explain this? (reply to 32163)

Dmitry: it neither make an error nor printing "‚Äî1"   i came up with the decision to not to deploy other contracts at init block. but still not sure that it is great

Dmitry: constructors can create its own dependencies (reply to 34138)

Dmitry: maybe this one makes it init(){     self.Lol = LolStruct { }; }  struct LolStruct {     a: Int as uint 64 = 0; } (reply to 34141)

Dmitry: and btw is there a way to save incomplete build? i cant even look at those ints

Dmitry: 1.3.1

Dmitry: build error changed  Tact compilation failed Error: Struct value is missing a field:  will work on it

Dmitry: this one still is an issue  default fields dont work (reply to 34142)

Dmitry: btw it seems that "tact-lang/tact.vim" got problems with ?new? tree sitter api or something.

Dmitry: this one returned once i initialized all the fields of the struct (reply to 34141)

Dmitry: ints' count is the same as fields' count   removing default values doesn't help (reply to 34141)

Dmitry: this "storage.fc" thingy got lines alike ((int, slice, int, int)) $<StructName>$_tensor_cast((int, slice, int, int) v) asm "NOP";

Dmitry: so i ~found a problem  i got:  struct Lol { ...// 8 fields } struct Heh { ... //5 fields }  struct Kek { data: Heh; lower: Lol; upper: Lol; // 18 fields = Lol x 2 + Heh } (reply to 34141)

Dmitry: and if i get rid of upper one it all began to compile

Dmitry: Kek is either too big or idk

Dmitry: i have removed kek, and used fields by themselves... it worked :(   i thought ive found a one fits all bulky template for dealing with functions + receivers (reply to 34156)

Dmitry: something wrong with mine (reply to 34161)

Dmitry: mb index haven't updated yet or smth

Dmitry: thx for reminding of the comand   but it didnt help

lee: how to init jetton content in contract

Konstantin: HI there! Is any one know why contract address is different if I'm trying get this adres directly from my contract and if I'm getting that address from jetton standard method  There are examples:  contract = await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address);  contract.address == jetton.getGetWalletAddress(gamer.address); ---> FALSE   But code for getGetWalletAddress is the same like      get fun get_wallet_address(owner_address: Address): Address {         let init: StateInit = initOf MyWallet(owner_address, myAddress());         dump(contractAddress(init));         dump(owner_address);         dump(myAddress());         return contractAddress(init);     }  so all values are correct owner_address and myAddress() in contract the same as in MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address) but always contractAddress(init) not equal  await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address).address  Thanks!

Anton: there is no list, you can add interface annotation as you see fit (reply to 34251)

balthy: it means the interfaces like : @interface("org.ton.jetton.master") not defined anywhere?  but what is the use case? for example, in solidity, the EIP codes are use for interface supputrt (reply to 34254)

cindy: Hi,bro,I am using your tact code on Swap.I have never successed,can you share me your tact example? (reply to 34284)

Sumit: You are probably sending incorrect arguments (reply to 34290)

cindy: I am testing the swap in tact. I am trying to swap RED to Blue. The address has been replaced to Route wallet address of Red token. (reply to 34291)

cindy: I can't find the wrong arguments.so confused. (reply to 34291)

cindy: My test is also simple. The client address has minted Red and Blue tokens. I just called the test function to swap the token.

Illia: so basically you derive addresses differently  you derive address for master from just owner address  we can note this as the following: hash(owner_address) -> master_address  but for item you derive the address like hash(owner_address, master_address) -> item_address  as you see, you provide different arguments when calculating the address of the contract; that's why addresses are different (reply to 34277)

Illia: if you want to get the same address using the getter function, then you need to store this addresses somewhere  the most straightforward solution is to put a getter for Item inside the Master  like using self.owner field  like get fun master() -> return myAddress() and get fun item() -> return initOf Item(self.owner, myAddress()) (reply to 34289)

Illia: what contract is that? (reply to 34295)

cindy: I am testing call stonfi contract. (reply to 34299)

Illia: You are likely missing out on the message body, it can't be hello joe take a look at docs.  https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/sdk/dex-v2/swap (reply to 34300)

cindy: Hi,thanks.I have put the message body in the receive contract to test. Client send hello Joe to my contract,then the contract send message body to the stonfi contract. (reply to 34303)

Dmitry: Sounds like it won't matter (reply to 34322)

Dmitry: Is there a way to dump in binary format?

Illia: nope as of now (reply to 34324)

Anton: as a temporary workaround you can block constant evaluation by using a variable:  import "@stdlib/deploy";  contract Test with Deployable {      get fun newAddressZero(): Address {         let zero = 0;         return newAddress(0,zero);     } } (reply to 34321)

jay: How to recieve ton coin when user call my contract function?

Illia: Users should attach some when sending the message to your contract (reply to 34359)

jay: yeah, but the contract myBalance still return 0.

Illia: Do you use Deployable trait? (reply to 34364)

Illia: If yes, then:  You need to override const storageReserve: Int = 1_000_000_000  It will store 1 toncoin on your account if you deploy it (reply to 34364)

Illia: If you want to store extra toncoins, you need to use nativeReserve() (reply to 34364)

jay: Thank you, I used the Deployable trait.

jay: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve

jay: I'll try to understand nativeReserve.

jay: It's working fine.

jay: I would rather implement a contract that can accept transfer

jay: I succeeded and was able to receive the transfer TON.

Illia: Please not that 1 is 1 nanotoncoin  1_000_000_000 (reply to 34372)

Illia: You can also just leave your receive empty  If you leave it empty, then all toncoins will be stored (reply to 34374)

Illia: Cause you don't call self.notify that will return excessive toncoins (reply to 34376)

jay: The second arg is mode.

jay: mode 1 means "Reserves all, but the specified amount of nanoToncoins.", so is it correct?

Illia: You can do this one as well if you want, but if you don't return toncoins back, then there is no need to reserve any (reply to 34379)

Illia: @expectfun (reply to 34381)

jay: https://tact-by-example.org/all These examples are not enough. Can Tact has more examples?

Illia: What types of examples do you want? If you provide me with some topics, I can create more.  I was thinking about explaining the multi-action transactions, is this relevant? (reply to 34384)

Illia: Btw there are some examples in tact repo https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/examples/rugpull.tact (reply to 34384)

Illia: Exit code 9 is  Cell underflow  That's like when you try to read 80 bits when the slice has just 10  That's probably cause u are missing your body as well (reply to 34398)

Illia: U should be able to make js calls (reply to 34418)

Illia: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md  You add decimals into metadata   {    "name": "Huebel Bolt",    "description": "Official token of the Huebel Company",    "symbol": "BOLT",    "decimals": 9,    "image_data": "..." } (reply to 34416)

Bulochkaüí¶: Is it neccessary to check values on != null ‚Äî that i receive from struct with          require(msg.id != null, "Incorrect id");  if struct/message doesn't have ? types of variables ? message UserPayment{     id: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins; }

Konstantin: thanks for the advise, do you have any specification of that?  Because it not clear, how it works. Also I found same issue https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/516   Also not understood why you think that is different address if   Item code         let init: StateInit = initOf Item(self.owner, self.master);                  dump(self.owner);  // EQAo-FxhMEmnBKIy0KNQmSB696ozXqBO9WGmsIhf3xEB-7zF         dump(self.master); // EQDVnS5QfXUBdXnSKXQpvoJSpeN4k6Rnf6cTfnimJBNZiryp         dump(contractAddress(init)); // EQC8MdQOQhaR0_i7mxM2aWnu5JIW7634bMrdi7234pPMn1Xb << -- DIFFERENT  and   Master code         let init: StateInit = initOf Item(owner_address, myAddress());          dump(owner_address);  // EQAo-FxhMEmnBKIy0KNQmSB696ozXqBO9WGmsIhf3xEB-7zF         dump(myAddress());  // EQDVnS5QfXUBdXnSKXQpvoJSpeN4k6Rnf6cTfnimJBNZiryp         dump(contractAddress(init)); // EQCZxYAqIOgjpMRL2EskZoQ6NP31yH9uCqt-90u7IYPSzggk << -- DIFFERENT  In both examples is the same initial addresses for  initOf Item - the values are the equal  Thank you @pantemon!

MdRAISH: Good üëçüòä

Bulochkaüí¶: Ok, i have another question Maybe someone knows any example of contract, which release escrow contract functionality? For example stores money before some message and after that sends money to the recipient? (reply to 34430)

Illia: In this example i release (withdraw) toncoins when the withdraw message is received from the owner https://github.com/henchtab/nenuma/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/broker.tact#L45  that's may be something you are looking for (reply to 34441)

balthy: i got 500 error when use this url for deploy   what URL should I use? (use /send + BoC)

Illia: what's the version of  tact-compiler you're using?  i've just built a demo using you code and run the tests using tact-lang/compiler v1.4.0  https://github.com/pantemon/laughing-octo-chainsaw.git  i have no problem as you described  i've also tried to clone the repo of the author of the issue, and this repo simply didn't compile ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  can u upload you code on github and share? 'cause i don't see how it can be wrong  btw calling like initOf inside the contract itself is a bit unusual  https://github.com/pantemon/laughing-octo-chainsaw/blob/main/contracts/master.tact#L13  what's the use case?  in this design, i would simply use myAddress()  it may be the reason why you got different addresses as tact < v1.4.0 may had the issue compiling such code (reply to 34434)

Illia: I'm experiencing similar issue when trying to await the transaction. I may try toncenter's indexer v3 (reply to 34445)

balthy: with TonClientV4? (reply to 34452)

Illia: if i want to send a regular message; there's no problem, but for some specific api routes, it gives me 500 now (reply to 34453)

balthy: how shoud i send the transaction from code?

balthy: on sandbox testnet

Illia: https://github.com/pantemon/laughing-octo-chainsaw/blob/main/contracts/master.tact#L13  you may have a look there (i've literarly just built this smart contract) (reply to 34455)

10x: is there a good guide on developong NFT collections with tact?

Illia: I haven't seen any. You should create your own contract which implements NFT standard  something like this but for NFTs  https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard (reply to 34462)

Illia: I've been just exporting types for my contracts via monorepo    "type": "module",   "main": "dist/index.js",   "module": "dist/index.mjs",   "types": "dist/index.d.ts",  so i've added these lines of code into my project, and then my contracts stopped compiling and i started getting some error like cannot compile modules...  now sure if that's a bug, but just wondering what's the cookbook solution for exporting types via monorepo  the snapshot of my code that doesn't compile is on the branch la-module  github.com/henchtab/nenuma/tree/la-module

Illia: i've also wanted to implement wait for the transaction feature  and i need to get the transaction boc to do that  is there a way to get it using tact-generated wrappers?  'cause i found that send method returns just void üò≠

Vlad: Having issues with "@stdlib/deploy";  Trying to deploy a contract, so that it sends a message to another contract inside of init() function.  Nevertheless, while testing, there is no outgoing messages ,except of the gas exccess sent to deployer

Vlad: I think it is a bad idea in general to mix contracts with frontend/backend   you will face a lot of module errors (reply to 34467)

Vlad: Wonder how the library is connected to Init() function? https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/deploy.tact (reply to 34471)

Vlad: hm, still wonder why DeployOk message is sent before my custom message from init() function, thus later not executed (reply to 34474)

Vlad: getter is not an option, since message is not just info, need to pay gas  Looks like I would have to find some workaround   P.S. I am trying to put the jetton wallet address for my contract inside of it (using discoverable jettons) (reply to 34477)

Anton: init is basically a regular receiver, we just set a bit in the contract storage so it‚Äôs only executed once (reply to 34476)

Vlad: why can't it send messages though? (reply to 34479)

Anton: it can (reply to 34480)

Vlad: Hm, then is the problem with library? (reply to 34471)

Anton: I need a reproducible example: code, sandbox tests and how to build and run everything

Vlad: here is the contract code https://github.com/Cosmodude/Nexton/blob/main/contracts/JNexTon.tact#L56  and here is the test for it  https://github.com/Cosmodude/Nexton/blob/main/tests/JNexton.spec.ts#L124 (reply to 34483)

Vlad: Hey folks, just out of curiosity: why TON took a path of its own set of instucrions set therefore its own languages: fift and func. Why not just WASM: it has a rich instructions set: https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/appendix/index-instructions.html It would make everyone's life so much f-ing easier, no fift no func no tact, just write it in rust or javascript and compile to wasm - done! I think is the biggest resistence for developers to start with TON, at least for me :(

Vlad: That‚Äôs a good question.  Not sure that WASM is compatible with TVM though (reply to 34488)

Vlad: for sure not at this point, its a long gone decision üòÇ (reply to 34489)

Dmitry: What can be the problem here? (reply to 34188)

Illia: Do you have any receive functions? Tact contracts throw 135 exit codes if they receive messages they don't recognize. If you add receive, there should be no error (reply to 34491)

Dmitry: That's the whole contract code (reply to 34492)

Dmitry: Deployable means they got deploymessage receivers

Illia: Do u send deploy message then? (reply to 34494)

Illia: If you send anything else then Deploy then it throws 135

Dmitry: I guess there's something with contract lifecycle and especially init (reply to 34492)

Dmitry: Yes. The default test code sends deploy message (reply to 34495)

Dmitry: It throws INSIDE init function (reply to 34496)

Dmitry: Not before not after

Dmitry: It throws on a row with Initof operator

Dmitry: It cannot get initof inside init func for some reason

Illia: Sending messages inside init is a bit unusual. I've been exploring what it builds into and literally init is just a faction that hashes code of the contract with data, and this data cell is constructed of the init. It's not supposed to run any message. In my code, I just make custom Deploy messages as I also require custom properties not known at the init time (reply to 34497)

Dmitry: But it doesn't throw on sending the message. It falls on initof

Illia: That's because you try to call myAddress but the contract is not deployed yet (reply to 34504)

Dmitry: My idea is to deploy one contract that will immediately deploy all of its util subcontracts (reply to 34503)

Dmitry: My address does work (And it should cause its not about deployed/not deployed but making a hash out of initial data, that is present in init) (reply to 34505)

Illia: Hm very strange, all right I will just go into silent mode and see what happens out there; I had lots of bugs with it in tact 1.3.0 so maybe it's different now, I just don't do any complex logic inside the init now

Dmitry: And i CAN make a custom deploy receiver but... For some reason i want to understand why the init is not suitable for this from technical perspective (reply to 34506)

Dmitry: It seems to be that init can have all the info that other functions have

Dmitry: "with it" = with init func? (reply to 34508)

Dmitry: üëâüëà im sorry for CAPS. It's only to make emphasis, not to be harsh (reply to 34508)

Illia: Yeah, with init (reply to 34511)

Illia: That's great. I just can't be helpful right now so can't be that objective. Very keen to know the answer. If you advance forward somewhere, please let me know (reply to 34512)

Mantrax: gm, I've read the doc but I don't understand how can I make a kind of mapping suitable for a large amount of entry ?

Mantrax: thanks (reply to 34518)

Nerses: what can cause such error during compilation npm ERR! could not determine executable to run  ?

Illia: what command are u running? (reply to 34524)

Nerses: npx blueprint build (reply to 34525)

Nerses: I have created blueprint project then changed directory of contracts I think it can cause that.How to init new blueprint project in directory of contracts without conflicting existing project

„Ö§: Can I accept Jetton tokens with message on my smart contract? The most near example is calling a function with sending ERC20 token, can we do that in tact?

Illia: yes, you can do, you need to listen for TokenTransfer notification  https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard#:~:text=message(0xf8a7ea5,the%20jetton%0A%7D  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md  https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard (reply to 34530)

„Ö§: Can you send some examples, from GitHub maybe ? (reply to 34537)

Pouya: Is anyone here who knows about tact and ton contracts audit?

Mantrax: I don't understand in https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard for in TokenTransfer what does this mean :         let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(self.master, msg.destination);           let walletAddress: Address = contractAddress(init); We are creating a JettonDefaultWallet contract for the receiver ?

Sergey: yeah. you should do it for two reasons: 1. you don't know the jetton address of recipient 2. user may not even have such jetton, so it is necessary to deploy wallet.   that's why you need state init (reply to 34542)

Mantrax: and if the receiver already has a JetonWallet ? (reply to 34543)

Sergey: so everything is going to be okay (reply to 34544)

Sergey: contract will be deployed at the same address and won't change anything

Mantrax: oh ok

Mantrax: ty

Sergey: np

Mantrax: and about the randomness ? Is it really trustable?

Mantrax: I mean with randomInt();

Dmitry: Depending on usecase (reply to 34552)

Mantrax: if I want to use it like a lotery (reply to 34554)

Dmitry: If it is not about millions of dollars -> may be okey (reply to 34555)

Dmitry: Validators can theoretically cheat

balthy: is there any way to deploy contract in the blueprint except call a function of that?  i want to first deploy it(in beforeAll in test) and then try to call the functions

Dmitry: You can create variable in "describe" callback and init it in before all. Then you can 'try to call the functions" in test cases (reply to 34558)

balthy: when i use init method and then try to call a get method, I got a call a non-active contract error (reply to 34559)

Dmitry: You should send deploy msg in before all

Dmitry: And btw it should be async

balthy: how should I send just a deploy message? i do not want to invoke any receive or any method of my contract just want to deploy it (reply to 34561)

Dmitry: You can deploy contract with receive (reply to 34563)

Dmitry: It is the way

Dmitry: You can send any msg(with code and init data) but as convention you should send deploy msg

Dmitry: The other way around you can read smth about snapshots. It can be smth you are talking about

Dmitry: It is ~saved blockchain state.

Dmitry: You can read about it in ton sandbox repo

10x: anyone familiar with NFT contracts on TON using TACT? I‚Äôm looking at the example https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-template-in-tact, wondering how to add: - paid mints - free mint w/ merkle tree (whitelist)  thanks! looks cool so far

User<7085045095>: Hy

Dmitry: you can use hashed user secrets as random seed: 1. Starting pre-game 2. Users pay for participation 3. Users create own secrets. 4. Users hash it and send this hash in the game contract. 5. You stop pre-game. Users can enter the game no more. 6. Game starts. 7. Timelocked contract wait for players to reveal their secrets. 8. When the time ran out one can end the game. The random seed is hash of users' secrets.   If participation is too cheap one can create lots of fake players and reveal their secret only if it makes him win. You can make people pay a big fee on secret sending and repay a part of it on secret reveal (reply to 34555)

Fardin: Hello i want to implement the STON into my TACT contract  for purchasing tokens what should I do?

unsphere: why is it unusual? if the main contract deploys other contracts like pools based on jetton0 & jetton1 for example it needs to use initOf to get the pool address or? https://tact-by-example.org/06-contract-deploy-another (reply to 34451)

Illia: let's define 'usual' and 'unusual'  'usual' is when you implement master-slave (or as it's also called parent-child) pattern  e.g., you have a collection, the collection deploys NFT items;  i consider that as usual as i've always worked with such code in FunC and hence now working in Tact  'unusual' this is when Todo deploys Todo, as in your example; that's when you call initOf inside the contract itself  if you're building a referral system which has a structure similar to the linked list, then yes, that's a great pattern, but I never used it on TON   btw that's an interesting task to do in FunC 'cause i literally haven't seen anyone doing that   i'm not involved with building tact compiler; if the question is to fix the problem, then just use 'usual' master-slave pattern  if the question is too figure out what is theoretically possible to do and the goal is not to fix staff, but to explore, then i'm likely to be not the best guide as i'm not involved with tact compilor development; i'm just a developer who tries to help others with building their web3 products  i've just tried to solve the problem ignoring that the question is like 'what theoretically i can achieve'  i'm very keen to see what this issues ends up with (reply to 34580)

Haris: Hi Guys! I want to pass map parameter type data in init function through typescript how can i do that? typescript asking me to pass Dictionary type data but i am unable to do it. Please help

Illia: If there are no receivers, then yeah, the message will bounce (if another contract bounces if there are no receivers)  If the message bounces, the state is preserved, i.e. there is no change (reply to 34605)

Illia: Have u added types for your dictionary? (reply to 34606)

Tobias: Is this a personal project or a commercial product? (reply to 34607)

Haris: i am trying to create Dictionary type object but cant do so (reply to 34611)

Illia: There inevitably is some cost involved when interacting with smart contracts.  Storing large amounts of data on the blockchain is no good.  You need to off-chain data that you don't really need or use ton storage.  If u want to subsidize transactions for your users, then you need to implement something like Tonkeeper Battery but which funds only interactions with your smart contracts (reply to 34607)

Son Pin: how to print wallet address on Testnet with same mnemonics. using @ton/ton WalletContractV4

Illia: the send functions creates an action during the action phrase that will be executed during the action phrase  since ton blockchain is async, once you sent your message from contract A to contract B, no matter what happens to contract B (whether it rejects the transaction or processes it gracefully) the state of contract A is not changes (unlike on Ethereum where if one action fails, then everything fails; therefore you need to make sure that if you message bounces you handle it gracefully) (reply to 34613)

Illia: i'll build up a demo once get back to the computer and update you; there's a possibility that maps are not supported for inits, but i have to double-check (reply to 34614)

User<6319350984>: Please check this out , MYSTERY Token on Ton (reply to 34629)

Illia: https://ton.org/address/  you can sub your address into these util to see how different addresses behave  if you want a testnet address, then you can convert it into any other by changing the prefix. i.e., the first letter (so if you want a bouncable testnet then you need the first letter to be k) and also you need to change the postfix, i.e., the last 4 letters (i.e. change them for IslI if you're doing bounceable testnet) (reply to 34627)

Danil: U have to use js file with config it

hŒîrdshell: do you have an example?

hŒîrdshell: content i feel should be a cookie cutter thing so many might have it done.

Illia: do you have init in your contract? you need to pass your content though the init function (that's the easiest way, alternatively, you can create a ChangeContent receiver and update content if you're owner) (reply to 34636)

hŒîrdshell: yea I know I have content as an arg, im more concerened about the actual deployment file (reply to 34640)

hŒîrdshell: just an example structure

Illia: afaik there're no beginner friendly tutorial for onchain metadata  basically, the idea is that you need to encode the data you need into a new Cell object so that it matches with these standard: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md  this is an example of how encode cell that matches the TEP64 standard for offchain metadata  https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/tutorials/collection-minting#encode-offchain-content:~:text=export%20function%20encodeOffChainContent(content%3A%20string) (reply to 34641)

hŒîrdshell: i found a helper file to convert the content data i think i should be good now (reply to 34649)

Matthew: Is there a tool that can help me calculate the fee for storing my smart contract data for 1 year?

Sergey: it is aprox 0.00000575 ton per kb per year (reply to 34651)

Anton: Take a look at this PR: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/pull/520  And help us reproduce your issue (reply to 34584)

Sergey: hm, probably my mistake.  but tact playground says following:  Storing 1000 32-bit integers only costs 0.023 TON per year by comparison.  1000 32-bit integers ~ 4000kb. that's how i calculated price per KB (reply to 34653)

Sergey: now i see my mistake)) it's price per byte, not per kb

Matthew: too expensive üò¢ for fully onchain dapp

Matthew: Will the storage fee be charged each time the contract stores additional data, or will I pay periodically

Illia: there's no tool for that as far as i'm aware of  that's good idea to create one as i was looking for something like that by myself  you can just set 0.05 and be sure that your contract will be alive for at least a few years (reply to 34651)

Matthew: if smartcontract store many data i think 0.05 ton not enough for some day üòÖ

Illia: the storage fee is charged per one second as contract exists onchain  it means that if you add new data into your contract, the storage fee per second will increase  you will have to pay higher storage fees if you don't use your contract for a while to keep the reserve in place (if you're doing override const storageReserve = 10_000_000) (reply to 34659)

Illia: 0.05 is like storing NFT item with offchain data for 100+ years  should be enough for most of the contracts depending how long you want them to be alive; unless you're storing your image onchain (reply to 34663)

Matthew: So it means if my contract has frequent transactions then the storage fee per second will not increase ?

Haris: Please help (reply to 34606)

Haris: Thanks let me check (reply to 34668)

Illia: imagine you contract's balance is 1 ton  let you contract eats 0.1 ton per second  if time = 0s, then you balance is 1 ton if time = 1s, then you balance is 0.9 ton if time = 2s, then you balance is 0.8 ton  now someone sends some transaction to your wallet, e.g., message Add and your contract calculates the result and, using self.notify, sends the result back to the owner  the value which arrived with Add message was 0.5 ton  the total transaction fees is 0.1 ton  as a result, when the transaction arrives at t = 2s, you pay 0.3 ton worth of fees and the sender of the message gets back 0.2 ton  that's because you paid 0.1 ton of fees + the contract locks 0.2 ton from you for future storage costs   in fact, you will not have such high fees i just made them high to make the math clear (reply to 34666)

Matthew: so i should deploy new contract every year üòÖ

Matthew: If so, the longer a smart contract is deployed and the more data it has, the higher its fee will be. Imagine an nft or a token whose fees increase over time: first year fee transfer is 0.1 ton, second year fee tranfer 0. 2 ton,  ten years  5 ton üòÖ while value of nft is 0.1 ton (reply to 34670)

Valli Nayagi: import "@stdlib/deploy";  struct Details {     level: Int as uint256;     duration: Int as uint256; }  contract TactCounter with Deployable {      myMap: map<Int as uint256, Details>;      init() {         self.myMap = emptyMap();     }     receive("SetMap") {         let det = Details{             level: 23894,             duration: 600         };         self.myMap.set(12345, det);     }      get fun getMap(): Details? {         return self.myMap.get(12345);     }     }

Valli Nayagi: How to edit the value in duration to 900? Is there a way to edit values in map?

Illia: the storage reserve is topped up only once  so if i continue my example,  t = 3s, contract's balance = 1 ton again t = 4s, contract's balance = 0.9 ton t = 5s, contract's balance = 0.8 ton (reply to 34672)

Illia: you just do  let abc = Details{   level: 23894,   duration: 900 };  self.myMap.set(12345, abc); (reply to 34674)

Matthew: fee per second is fixed at it init contract for depend on data on contract

Illia: yes, it depends on the total number of cells the contract is using  the storage fee is paid for the contract's code ('cause ultimately all the smart contracts are bags of cells)  and for the data stored at the c7 (which is a cell as well) (reply to 34679)

Matthew: example if contract storage info of  1000 user, fee per second 0.1 2000 user fee per second still 0.1 for morethan. i think more than, so back to my above example if i have an NFT,  on first year my nft have 1000 holder, transfer fee is 0.1 ton,  but on second year my nft have 1 milllion holder, transfer fee is maybe 1 ton per transfer

Sergey: why would you need to store info about all your nft holders? (reply to 34681)

Illia: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/fees  Have a look at this. That's a comprehensive guide.  You must avoid storing your NFTs in the hashmap. The fees for hashmaps depend on the number of elements you store. That's unpredictable. (reply to 34681)

Danil: Anybody have a js that could receive jettons from ownerAddress?

Danil: An example

Nerses: having only address of smart contract how I can check f it has receive method for certain type of message ?

Nerses: It is something like solidity interface

Illia: There are no Solidity-interfaces-like feature as of now. AFAIK it's planned for Q3 this year (reply to 34695)

Nerses: thanks a lot (reply to 34697)

Illia: You can expect that something has to have a given receiver. If someone messes this up, you can notify them by sending back the bounced message (if the other contract doesn't exist or bounces if it receives unknown message) (reply to 34694)

Nerses: so having only address I can know if ithat contract implements some certain methods ? (reply to 34701)

ü¶Å: Hey‚Ä¶

Illia: Btw do you have any links on discussions of the interface standards as well as guidance for sharing contracts on TON? I've seen that they are in the roadmap, but I'm not sure if that's possible to see some intermediary working (reply to 34701)

Nerses: will i pay transaction fee for this getter     get fun getHTLCDetails(hashlock: Int): HTLC? {         return self.contracts.get(hashlock);     }  ?

Illia: Nope (reply to 34712)

Illia: There is some gas limit of 200k AFAIK  If you get it up, then the getter will revert. So don't do too complicated getters (reply to 34712)

Nerses: Important point.i will take it into account.Thanks a lot (reply to 34719)

Illia: Do you have wrappers generated in the build folder? You can just use them (or copy code from them). They will do the boilerplate for you (reply to 34716)

User<6442034874>: ye i got wrappers, any example of how would that work? (reply to 34721)

User<6442034874>: hmmmmmmm now im getting exit code 136 which is Invalid Address but I dont know what address is invalid (reply to 34722)

Illia: Are u using Blueprint? You can debug the contract with github.com/henchtab/shrek (reply to 34725)

Illia: Try again (reply to 34727)

Illia: I changed the link (reply to 34726)

User<6442034874>: can't get it to work, I will try to figure this out some other way (reply to 34726)

Illia: Do you have a problem with the logger (like it gives an error) or you just didn't manage to set it up? (reply to 34732)

User<6442034874>: didnt manage to set it up üò≠ (reply to 34735)

Illia: Out of interest, where are you stuck? I built this package and am now wondering how to improve developer experience (reply to 34737)

Illia: Did u manage to new Logger(blockchain)? (reply to 34738)

Dmitry: you pay transaction fee when you send a transaction(ie on-chain invocation).   if you dont send a transaction but rather call getter from outside world(ie off-chain) you dont pay.    this getter can be used both in onchain tx (only calls from the same contract: eg receive() can call its contract getter ) and in offchain scenario(your frontend app calls getter by itself) (reply to 34712)

Nerses: Thnx for detailed explanation (reply to 34742)

Dmitry: not sure but getters are smth that RPC-nodes are responsible for. so whatever they choose to set will be the limit (reply to 34719)

User<6442034874>: i managed to get the contract send NFT but I am wondering now why does it not show here Received NFT (reply to 34739)

User<6442034874>: This is failing to call excess for some reason

User<6442034874>: Also there is no "received NFT" message in history which is weird too

Illia: yeah, but currently it's set for 200k gas (reply to 34744)

Dmitry: as far as i get it you can make your own node with your own config (reply to 34749)

Dmitry: but nevertheless thx for data

User<6442034874>: Again, after i called the contract I've received NFT without any notification (reply to 34745)

Illia: well, notifications of tonkeeper are not part of that discussion, you better ask guys from tonkeeper chat (reply to 34753)

User<6442034874>: what's the @ of the chat?

Illia: if you get nfts, that's great, tonkeeper pro may not have notifications yet, so you can try tonkeeper mobile and it should fix the problem

Illia: you can find that on their website https://tonkeeper.com/ (reply to 34755)

User<6442034874>: nah its same on extension, I've seen apps saying Received NFT and showing badge of the icon etc. (reply to 34756)

Hugo: gm - new to the ecosystem and looking to build smart contracts using Tact. How developped and supported is it as a programming language vs func for instance?

Illia: very well supported and excellent for learning, take a look at Tact by Example (reply to 34770)

Hugo: Thank you! Will have a look. Where is the best place to ask implementation questions? Is it here?

Illia: +, just drop a question here if you're not sure about something or DM me (reply to 34772)

Key: Hello everyone, I'm building a telegram mini app, I want to authenticate users, after verifying init data from frontend by bot token, do I still need to create jwt token, or is that enough?

jay: You can choose your preferred authorization method, session or jwt are both possible.

Illia: You can also use TON Proofs to authenticate users on the backend. It's like asking them to sign some message and then verifying if the message is signed by the user's public key   https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/sign (reply to 34786)

Ryan: Hi, does anyone know how to use ECRECOVER tvm opcode in Tact? It would be great if there is an exampleüòÉ

Illia: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions#native-functions  You need to use native functions  https://github.com/henchtab/nenuma/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/subscriber.tact#L3  This is an example of how I used accept_message  The idea is that accept_message is inside the stdlib.fc and we create a binding to this function in the stdlib.fc  I have to check if there's a function for ECRECOVER  If there's no such function, then simply add by expanding the stdlib (reply to 34801)

Ryan: Ok, let me try, thanks!

Illia: tonkeeper.com (reply to 34785)

jay: How can I implement proof.begin_parse_exotic on Tact?

jay: This is the func code.

jay: I want to verify merkle tree proof on Tact.

Illia: mmm this is very nice thanks (reply to 34812)

jay: Thank you, I understood. I‚Äôll try it soon.

jay: Can send_code used in this way?

Illia: Yeah (reply to 34816)

Illia: Btw where did u find this code? Is it somewhere on GitHub? (reply to 34810)

jay: https://github.com/Gusarich/airdrop/blob/main/contracts/airdrop.fc

jay: From here.

Illia: nice, thanks mate (reply to 34822)

unsphere: if i need to do 2 TokenTransfers in one contract function how to do it correctly with SendRemainingValue? I cant use fixed value because when i test the contract and set e.g. now() + 3 years the transfer will cost more than the fixed value. If I only have 1 TokenTransfer then value = 0 + SendRemainingValue works for all years going forward.

Nerses: can I check two addresses being same with operator ==  ?

User<6442034874>: yep import "@stdlib/deploy";  contract MessageSender with Deployable {      deployer: Address;     lastSender: Address;       init() {         self.deployer = sender(); // sender() of init is who deployed the contract         self.lastSender = newAddress(0, 0); // zero address     }      receive("who") {         if (sender() == self.deployer) {             dump("deployer");         } else {             dump("not deployer!");         }     }       receive("hello") {         if (sender() != self.lastSender) {             self.lastSender = sender();             dump("hello new sender!");         }     } }  ^ example (reply to 34830)

User<6442034874>: any ideas why?

Illia: How do you test this one? Do you specify your JettonReceiver contract address as response_destination when transferring jetton? (reply to 34874)

User<6442034874>: nope, i just send to the contract address of JettonReceiver (reply to 34876)

User<6442034874>: then the contract of the jetton deploys a wallet address contract which notifies the destination

User<6442034874>: and destination uses that new deployed contract for sending interactions, now I did some tests and realized that JettonReceiver is not registering message(0x7362d09c) TokenNotification message

User<6442034874>: (i have enough for fees on the contract)

Illia: can u add github.com/henchtab/shrek logger and the output you get in the sandbox? (reply to 34879)

Illia: if you want to get the notification, then you need to have forward_ton_amount > 0  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-wallet.fc#L127  otherwise, transfer_notification is not sent (reply to 34879)

Illia: if you set forward_ton_amount let's say 0.05 Toncoins, then the transfer should work (reply to 34877)

User<6442034874>: i have it on > 0 always, now im trying to do it with forward_payload

Alexander: Funny, what‚Äôs the purpose of the require strings if they don‚Äôt appear anywhere later? How can I correspond the numeric exit code to the certain triggered require operator? (reply to 34952)

Alexander: How to use numeric if the require operator accepts strings? And for example the existing jetton and nft implementations also use require with strings. How can I tell which require failed? (reply to 34953)

Sergey: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-debug#nativethrowunless (reply to 34961)

Sergey: what you see in tact jetton implementation - is just an standart implementation, but usually everyone uses func one. like this https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-wallet.fc or this https://github.com/ton-blockchain/minter-contract (reply to 34961)

Alexander: Thanks, it‚Äôs clearer now. At least there‚Äôs a way to know the error. So - the require operator is pointless then? Given that I cannot get its message anyway? (reply to 34962)

Sergey: it isn't pointless if you just need to throw some error, but it is pointless if you need to undestand what was the error (reply to 34964)

Anton: you can try, but it actually should not accept structs, the difference between structs and messages is the implicit ‚Äúopcode‚Äù field that every message has, it‚Äôs a tag used to dispatch. You can specify that opcode using syntax like this one:  message(42) MyMessage {     field1: Int;     field2: Int; } (reply to 34958)

Anton: 42 is the opcode

Anton: you can. look in the .abi file (reply to 34964)

Vlad: Thanks (reply to 34966)

Sergey: now the require function makes sense (reply to 34968)

Daniil: 100k - no, but around 20k is OK unless you ever want to iterate over them (reply to 34947)

Dmitry: you probably can create map<int, int> and make use of bitmask (reply to 34948)

Dmitry: not sure about 100k but the density will probably increase

Dmitry: or even map<int, cell> and pack cell with flags (reply to 34972)

Denis: Hi, help me please, how to download transaction history of wallet in csv file?

Daniil: It's a more general question not related directly to Tact, so please forward it to @tondev_eng (reply to 34977)

Denis: Thanks a lot! (reply to 34978)

jay: @Gusarich @D_M1s5 Can you tell me which map structure can store more data? I'm not sure what type of value would be better.

Buggy: Is there anyway to compile Tact language to Rust just like it does as wrappers with typescript?

Buggy: Right now I use tonlib-rs which has basic function of contract which is wallet, jetton contract factory. Else than that so I have to implement it myself to let Rust know what t has to do with.

Daniil: If you need more than a few thousand entries, consider thinking about distributed architecture with small smart contracts that store data for each individual user/entry/row (reply to 34980)

jay: Can we get and check child contract state from main contract? I don't want users to deploy child contracts

Gasheye 2: Ton

jay: Like https://github.com/Gusarich/airdrop/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#claiming-the-airdrop, users have to deploy contract and then send claim, it's a bad user experience.

Illia: hm that's interesting; btw @sedov why did you prefer such distributed design in this case?  i'm currently researching ways for sharding contracts on the TON blockchain, i thought that Load Balancer implemented as round robin can be very nice solution for all the smart contracts on the TON blockchain;  how do you feel about this? i think of implementing one (reply to 34989)

Illia: not all contracts* but most of them, especially, if you have replicas (reply to 34990)

Daniil: these can be deployed from the main contract (reply to 34989)

Daniil: at the time when I was writing that smart contract, wallet apps such as Tonkeeper were breaking on exotic cells with merkle proofs in messages, so I made a solution with external message that can be sent without using an app  now it's possible to rewrite the code to make it a little bit cheaper and simpler (reply to 34990)

Johnny Le: Can I have the code for that mate (reply to 34996)

Johnny Le: digging in merkle tree too

Illia: could u provide some hints on func/fift sources that implement such proofs? (reply to 34996)

Nwobueze: You're welcome! (reply to 34979)

Daniil: It was mentioned above: https://github.com/Gusarich/airdrop (reply to 34999)

Illia: but as you said, you don't use exotic cells and proofs   are there examples for them in FunC? (reply to 35001)

Daniil: I do use them. It's just that these are sent separately in an external message to overcome wallet apps limitations of that past time (reply to 35002)

Illia: Oh right my bad, thanks mate (reply to 35003)

jay: Is there a demo code for verifying merkle proof at Tact?

Illia: personally, i haven't found any yet (reply to 35005)

jay: üôà Looks like we'll have to call the func code.

jay: I think Tact need a utility functions lib, ex: transfer  transferJetton etc.

Daniil: in 1.5.0 probably üòÑ (reply to 35009)

jay: My next question is how to send jetton at Tact? Is anyone know this?

jay: I saw https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard, but I still no understanding.

lee: Are there any examples or exercises of staking contracts?

Sergey: The same way as at func. You need to send transfer token message to the Jetton wallet of the sender, where recipient will be your smart contract address, and then listen to token notify message. Jetton standard ftom playground will help you with that (reply to 35029)

–ê–≥–∞: Any example how to make custom token ?

Illia: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard  this is the best one you can get afaik (reply to 35039)

Nerses: is there Jetton implementation in TACT ? couldnt find appropriate one for understanding Jetton architecture

Illia: it's yet to come; the best one yet https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard (reply to 35041)

jay: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard This is the Jetton implementation. But this demo haven't operate jetton. (reply to 35041)

Nerses: i have seen that but it isnt the best material I would like to see for implementing. (reply to 35042)

Nerses: I have implemented HTLC s in native token and want to do same for Jetton

Nerses: But I cant find any appropriate info to understand how Jetton works

Nerses: isnt it public production code of Jetton ? (reply to 35043)

jay: Thank you, would you give me the playground url? (reply to 35037)

Sergey: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard  You sent it yourself) (reply to 35048)

jay: I'm with the demo that wants to operate Jetton.

jay: For example, withdraw jetton from the contract or transfer jetton from contract to user.

Illia: are there any previews? would love to contribute (reply to 35051)

Nerses: thanks a lot (reply to 35051)

Neo: Hi, what is diffrent with jetton_wallet and jetton_wallet_governed ?

Neo: i have a contract use standard jetton token everything is ok, when i deploy mainnet use real usdt , has error Cell underflow , usdt's jetton_wallet contract type is jetton_wallet_governed, so what's diffrent  with jetton_wallet and jetton_wallet_governed ?

Nerses: is there any platform where I can verify Jetton contracts of testnet ?

jay: Hello~ (reply to 35091)

avi: Hello

avi: Looking for  contract code that can send token to a telegram contact. Any pointers?

lee: is there anything wrong?

jay: Please check where throw the error code 7

jay: Excuse me, how can I deploy a Jetton by @ton/sandbox in unit test?

Illia: I like your idea mate; try using it's official chat to tell more about it (reply to 35118)

Illia: https://tact-by-example.org/05-the-stoppable-trait (reply to 35111)

Illia: You can use TreasuryContract to send Jettons and test transactions.  Have a look at   https://github.com/henchtab/nenuma/blob/main/packages/contracts/tests/Broker.spec.ts#L52  If you specifically want to deploy a wallet, you will need to have a wrapper to interact with such a wallet.   Have a look at how tests are done for the new wallet W5   https://github.com/tonkeeper/w5/tree/main/tests  You can use w5 in your tests as well if u want, but I don't see much point unless you deliberately test batch transactions (reply to 35103)

Illia: Once you add it to your contract, you will get the receiver Stop

jay: üòÖ so hard.

jay: Very frustrating, one broken at a time.

jay: Can we return a jetton balance in a contract?

Brady: Hello, everyone. How to identify that a transaction is a deploy nft type?

Illia: That's because you need explicitly add self.requireNotStopped() before each transfer. You can find the source code of this trait to explore how it's supposed to work (reply to 35128)

Illia: You can do that as well. But if you add this into your trait, pay attention to the fact that all contracts inherited from this trait will be stoppable (and the trait needs to implement Stoppable) (reply to 35133)

Illia: you can do that mate, keep working üí™ (reply to 35126)

Illia: You can create a property that will increase every time you transfer Jettons in and out (reply to 35129)

Illia: Or you can implement a message on your custom Jetton like provide_wallet_data and send back take_wallet_data  with details you need (reply to 35129)

jay: thank you, I returned jetton wallet address from contractüòÇ (reply to 35136)

Illia: all right, what's you problem mate? what're you trying to build

Illia: can u share you contracts with me so i can have a look? this example literarily has everything you need (reply to 35120)

Illia: i'm pantemon on github

Illia: pretty much yeah (reply to 35153)

Illia: i'll have a look in a few hours as get back to my pc (reply to 35152)

jay: You can add all your logic when receive token transfer message, Include block user transfer. (reply to 35153)

jay: Sorry, I am a beginer on TON. But I think it‚Äôs useful because all transfer logic will be processing by this message handle

Mr.Dashti: What is the main site for making tokens on the ton network?

Mr.Dashti: Can you explain more? (reply to 35172)

Stephan: Hello, please tell me, is it safe to launch a project in production whose smart contracts were written in Tact and not in Func? It's just that TON warns that the language is created by the community and you need to be more careful   I‚Äôm sorry. Misspell. It was a question (reply to 35173)

Stephan: like this?    addresses: map<5, Address>; (reply to 35265)

User<6981260071>: No 5 should be Int as key (reply to 35267)

User<6981260071>: In your script make a count check for they array

Stephan: addresses: map<Address, 5>; ? (reply to 35268)

User<6981260071>: addresses: map<Int, Address>;

Stephan: no, I dont have frontend yet, I don't even have any functions that interact with this list. (reply to 35275)

User<6981260071>: Then in tact use . length and count the array (reply to 35277)

Stephan: that is, it needs to be done through the check "if addresses > variable With 5 - throw(111)" ? (reply to 35279)

Tonion Dev: the methods marked as get are just viewable and can not change the contract states and can call from  your contract or outside of contract but if you want to change the contract's states you should use non-get functions and call them in a wrapper function by a receiver or directly in a receiver block actually if you are come from solidity, get methods are like view in solidity  FYI - @tonSniperDev (reply to 35307)

Tonion Dev: I suggest use blueprint to structure your project and after build your contracts it make a ts wrapper for you that you can use it in your tests our anywhere else.  For example; This counter contract test maybe can help you:  Test:  https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/main/tests/utils/Counter.behavior.ts  Implementation:  https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/main/contracts/mocks/utils/counterImp.tact (reply to 35313)

Tonion Dev: And then try to use sandbox to simulate your contracts deployment and try to call methods like the mentioned links  FYI - @tonSniperDev (reply to 35318)

Tonion Dev: Hi Jay   Maybe this implementation of a basic Jetton be helpful for you:  https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/main/contracts/mocks/tokens/jetton/basic.tact  Test:  https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/main/tests/tokens/jetton/basic/Basic.behavior.ts  Take a look at test to get your answer üòé (reply to 35317)

User<6981260071>: so i should call this https://github.com/olivergadelarsen/tonthreespace/blob/main/tests/TonThreeSpaceContract.spec.ts#L49,#L70  before i check if user is stored? (reply to 35357)

User<6981260071>: but that wont make since bc i want to check if user is stored first before store user

User<6981260071>: can you find a solution mate üôÇ (reply to 35357)

Tonion Dev: you deployed the contract in this state there is no stored user and when you call the : const result= await tonThreeSpaceContract.getIs``WalletStored(testAddress); you got FALSE, because there is no stored account yet  before call the getIsWalletStored you should store the wallet first and then call the getIsWalletStored then will get TRUE (reply to 35362)

User<6981260071>: but then my contract structur is wrong ?   and if i store the user before check user is stored then the same user will stored over and over again right ? (reply to 35363)

Tonion Dev: It is based on your need and goal of your project (reply to 35364)

User<6981260071>: now i get true all the  time.. And user count stays the same..   Can you help rewrite my contract to i first check if user is stored if not then store the user please üôÇ (reply to 35365)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: thanks for sharing that stuff, quite awesome!   yet i have some question about that: most of the wallets do not support exotic cell, thus we have to conduct two action to claim the airdrop. I think the user experience is quite bad, doesn't it?  Our implementation (w/o exotic cell) is quite cheap as well, and is highly customizable, it should be a better choice now, just my opinion, free to discuss about that. (reply to 35504)

Illia: can you give an example? doesn't sound right; btw it's generally a bad idea to send a message to itself (i tried designing such contracts a few times) and it's better to call accept_message if you want your contract to pay all the remaining fees for the transaction (reply to 35638)

Illia: as i said in my message from above, it's not great idea to send a message from the contract to itself; what's your use case? (reply to 35641)

Illia: what's your use case? generally, there's no way to do that; you can include the stateinit to deploy the contract and execute the message unless it's deployed; (reply to 35643)

Illia: it doesn't say that, but fields are optional; you don't need to provide lt or transaction_hash; if you provide them though, you will get only transactions that match this pattern (reply to 35658)

Illia: The answer is it depends. If the message you're sending is like sum numbers a and b, then such a transaction is pretty much deterministic. It means you can actually quite well predict the fees. But if you have something that involves a loop inside, then the number of iterations and, as a result, the gas depends a lot on the actual value. You could have run a simulation, but since TON is async, that's inefficient and rather expansive. It's recommended to use a 'carry pattern' which carries all the value along the transaction to make sure that all fees are paid and then the excessive funds are returned back to someone. Take a look at TEP-74. There's a response_destination address. It will receive all the excessive funds from the transaction.  https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md#1-transfer (reply to 35681)

Degen: map: map<Address, Int>;  How to determine if an address already exists before adding it?

Anton: use .get and check if the result is null (reply to 35687)

Degen: Is this correct? Why does the compiler throw an error?

Anton: there is no guarantee the element you are looking up is always in the map, hance the return type of .get is optional (reply to 35689)

Anton: e.g. Int?, but you are trying to force it to be non-optional

Degen: Is this correct?

Anton: looks good

raya: Hello guys, Is there any way I can check which jetton token received when a Tact contract receive the TokenNotification message? or get the jetton master address

Max: Hey everyone, is anyone experienced in Tact open to doing paid hourly consultations? In English or Russian  I‚Äôm experimenting with Tact but having a hard time overcoming some issues (it‚Äôs mostly jetton creation related questions). I‚Äôm looking for someone who could help me

Max: I‚Äôm trying to create and mint Jettons inside of another contract, but it‚Äôs not working and a transaction fails. The main question, am I initializing a jetton contract and minting tokens correctly?   I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback, thanks!   Here‚Äôs my main contract:  receive(msg: CreateMarket) {  let initCode: StateInit = initOf TheJetton(self.admin, "description".asComment(), 1000000000);    let jettonsReceiver = address("0QDzADdEMSGsp-dMTrHaeEKBB7HCgRoVGsuk_ya03UYhcRgu");    send(SendParameters{   to: contractAddress(initCode),   value: ton("0.25"),   mode: SendIgnoreErrors,   body: Mint { amount: 100000, receiver: jettonsReceiver }.toCell(),      code: initCode.code,   data: initCode.data  }); }  Also here's TheJetton contract: contract TheJetton with Jetton {  total_supply: Int as coins;  owner: Address;  content: Cell;  mintable: Bool;      ... everything is similar to the example from tact-by-example }   Here's an example transaction: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/258a9d6fafc8023accac5c63e38e65d489448e89678146c3f535911a6c471f1f

Degen: Is it not possible to send messages from one contract to other contracts?

Degen: Why doesn't next_item_index increase?

Degen: It is possible to test the add message alone, but sending the add message from another contract will have no effect.

Degen: Sent here

Degen: NftSaleWithBoxContract holds the address of NftCollectionContract and then sends a message to the address of nftCollectionContract

Degen: outdated results? Do you mean that next_item_index actually increased?

Anton: addresses are allowed as map key types: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/maps#allowed-types

Alfred: send a msg back to the caller with a body include the new contractAddress (reply to 35996)

Alfred: I think you are trying to console.log(JSON.stringify(mint_records)). Try print the address and count separately. (reply to 36000)

Degen: Unable to output json in the contract

Max: via emit or self.reply? (reply to 36006)

Degen: The official demo does not use address as key.

Degen: ü§î

Alfred: maybe custom Message, or you can try self.reply(address.asComment()) first if you don't need more data to provide back (reply to 36010)

Max: How do you then catch this reponse on the front-end? Is there any guide on that?

Alfred: Only dump the primitive value like dump(self.mint_records1.get(1)!!) (reply to 36008)

Alfred: It will return to the caller contract. If you'd like to get the address at FE. Just calculate it using the initCode and data again. (reply to 36014)

Alfred: const userAccountContract = provider.open(await UserAccount.fromInit(poolAddress ,providerAddress));     const userAccount = await userAccountContract.getAccount(); (reply to 36014)

Alfred: Similar to this one.

Alfred: Use the similar code as you use on chain to calculate the address. It should be the same one.

Max: But how do you retrieve the response from  the .send function? (reply to 36025)

Freed: It is sent but result of execution is unknown. You probably would want to wait until transaction goes through and then read it's logs (reply to 36026)

Alfred: export interface Sender {     readonly address?: Address;     send(args: SenderArguments): Promise<void>; } (reply to 36026)

Alfred: You won't be able to read the result directly.

Alfred: Maybe use provider.getTransactions to read it once the seqno increase

Aish: Hey guys, Self.reply and sending balance in sendRemainingValue mode in transactions only send the TON amount that is remaining from the transaction Fees is what I read.  But when I use them in my contract, a little amount of TON from my contract is getting deducted. So at some point will my contract be depleted of all TON.

Winder: I found dump() in tact will cause some problems sometime. If I remove dump(), things will be ok. Any one got this problem?

Anton: nope, works fine for me  have you checked if the gas is sufficient? (reply to 36354)

Winder: yes. I checked the gas, I changed the gas from 1 ton to 10 ton, but still fails. weird. Sometimes it makes the tx fail, sometimes it makes the message send fail. (reply to 36355)

Max: My contract dynamically mints these jettons. How do I obtain the jetton wallet address for the jetton upon its initiation?  Here‚Äôs how I mint them: receive("InitJettons") {         let theInitCode: StateInit = initOf TheJetton(‚Ä¶);                  self.theJetton = theInitCode;                  send(SendParameters{ ‚Ä¶  });          // How do I obtain the jetton wallet address for the contract here? }  And here‚Äôs how I handle the incoming transfers of the same jettons in the same contract: receive(msg: TokenNotification) {         let jettonWalletAddress: Address = context().sender;                  // Here I want to ensure that the received jettons == TheJetton that we‚Äôve created above } (reply to 36348)

Winder: But If I remove the dump() or change the config from debug: true to debug: false. Things got OK. It happened sometime, not always. Seems some condition makes the error

Daniil: What‚Äôs the exit code? (reply to 36356)

Winder: -14 (reply to 36359)

Winder: I got this. It does a out of gas error, thanks guys

Nerses: what can cause such error Type "Builder" does not have a function named "storeMaybeStringTail"                                                                               Line 153, col 30: > 153 |             let slc: Slice = beginCell().storeAddress(myAddress()).storeAddress(sender()).storeUint(ctx.value,257).storeMaybeStringTail(msg.data.dstChain).asSlice();

Anton: you are trying to fit too much data into one single cell  one cell can only contain up to 1023 bits of data, and each address occupies 267, so you can store only 3 addresses in a cell and even a 257-bit integer won‚Äôt fit anymore (reply to 36384)

Anton: you need to create a tree of cells, using cell references

Nerses: slc0 has only 4 references,slc1 has 2 address and 1 int, and slc has 2 address 1 int and 2 ref. Cant figure out where is overflow as cell can have up to 1023 bit and 4 refs (reply to 36388)

Anton: where do you have endCell() in your original expression? (reply to 36390)

Nerses: i havent any (reply to 36391)

Nerses: let slc1: Cell = beginCell().storeAddress(msg.data.srcReceiver).storeInt(msg.data.timelock,257).storeAddress(msg.data.messenger).endCell();             let slc: Slice = beginCell().storeAddress(myAddress()).storeAddress(sender()).storeInt(ctx.value,257).storeRef(slc0).storeRef(slc1).asSlice();

Nerses: should it be like this ?

Anton: I have no idea, that totally depends on what you are trying to do

Nerses: I meant will it pass compute phase ? (reply to 36395)

Daniil: I strongly recommend you to use structs in Tact instead of manually composing and parsing cells (reply to 36393)

Nerses: In my case I need to do sha256 of message few fields that I received.Do you recommend to create struct from needed fields and then pass it as argument for hash function ? (reply to 36397)

angel: I am going to create 5% commission Jetton that 5% of total amount is transferred to Jetton owner's wallet when users pucharge and sell from Ston.fi. To do this, I have built a Jetton, but 5% commission is applied to all transaction including users transfer, not only transaction from Dex. so I thought to ignore users transfer by adding "if" statement passing only pucharge/sell from Dex. however, to add "if" statement, I have to know already added Dex pool address. but how can I add liquidity using my Jetton don't deployed yet? I use Tact language and it is good. There is a upgrade method, but Tact don't allow upgrading smart contract now. Is there any other solution you know? I hope you helping me. Thank you.

Vasily: Guys, is it possible to recognize transactions in the blockchain on Tact? For example: purchase of a token and withdrawal of rewards from a liquid pool? If so, how can I do it?

User<7413585778>: sure, it is possible. to identify specific transactions such as the purchase of a token or withdrawal of rewards from a liquidity pool, you need to monitor and analyze the blockchain for relevant transaction types and smart contract interactions.  any other questions? or do you need a developer for this work? (reply to 36507)

Vasily: Thank you. Which methods can be used to analyze a blockchain for transaction types? (reply to 36508)

User<7413585778>: yeah, so there are some methods to identify specific transactions. well, you can identify it by setting full node.  then, in programming, you can make custom scripts (using python, js, ton sdk and so on) and interact with smart contracts. (reply to 36511)

Vasily: All right, thank you! We'll give it a try. (reply to 36512)

harlan: The tons pledged by the user remain in the master contract. When pledging, the user's contract is created. How should the message be sent?

Gally: why result = undefined when send message to ton contract

Davis: Hello, how can I build a contract that can send multiple NFTs to upgrade into another NFT?

A: Hi guys. Is there any documentation about how to work with Cell, Slice, and Builder data types in Tact? I know that they are low-level primitive data types in Tact, but have not seen any tutorials about them.

Alfred: Check the examples and existing contract. (reply to 36530)

A: I didn't get it. I know that there are methods like toCell() or toCell.asSlice() to convert complicated data types to Cells or Slices and vice versa ( using fromCell() or fromSlice() ) but I still do not understand why and where should we use Cells or Slices? (reply to 36531)

Alfred: If you are using tact, usually you can use a struct/message. If you wanna to process a message from an existing contract and you know how the data looks like, you can use cell.loadXXX to read them.

Alfred: struct and message will be compiled to cell and slices as well.

Emmanel: Use apis (reply to 36671)

Cardinal: hm, when user send claim, smart contract send api and when get true from api, i give some rewards? like this? (reply to 36672)

Emmanel: Oh, you can't do that on smart contract (reply to 36674)

Emmanel: You can't interact with external API onchain

Emmanel: You can create a map and map his address to what he paid every time he pays, you won't need to loop and it's cheaper that way (reply to 36671)

Cardinal: yeah, but problem is in contract storage, if users too much, gas is higher  if i send claim func any other transactionId, have some method to get his data? (reply to 36677)

Emmanel: How many things are you storing already? (reply to 36678)

Emmanel: The best thing is to keep it in contract. It will take little bytes if you use map

Emmanel: Don't store the txId , just the amount sent

Emmanel: Unless you want to emit the the txId and catch it offline, and save it on offline db, when the user comes to claim, you can query your offchain db and perform the claim action, but that might be risky as you have to manage more security issues

Alexander: Why it said in the official docs that Tact doesn‚Äôt support code upgrades?

Daniil: you can try using SETCODE instruction manually but there's a big chance that it won't work properly with Tact smart contract systems  native contract upgrades are going to be implemented in the future (no exact date/version for that yet) (reply to 36698)

Nerses: can different Jetton implementations have different names for Token transfer Message ?

cindy: update: I have to << 1 to get 3326308580. However,it still is unequal to 3326308581. I guess there are some field missing. (reply to 36695)

Nerses: i have written such code for my project.It might be helpful for you.And also for parsing the message you should use functions created during compilation  import { HttpClient, Api } from 'tonapi-sdk-js'; import { Cell } from '@ton/core'; import { Address } from 'ton'; import { hexToBase64 } from '../utils/utils'; import { loadCommitId } from '../wrappers/HashedTimeLockTON';  async function parseEmit(address: string, token: string, index: number) {     const httpClient = new HttpClient({         baseUrl: 'https://testnet.tonapi.io',         baseApiParams: {             headers: {                 Authorization: Bearer ${token},                 'Content-type': 'application/json'             }         }     });      const client = new Api(httpClient);      try {         const tx = await client.blockchain.getBlockchainAccountTransactions(Address.parse(address).toString());         for (let i = 0; i < tx.transactions[index].out_msgs.length; i++) {             if (tx.transactions[index].out_msgs[i].msg_type === 'ext_out_msg' && tx.transactions[index].out_msgs[i].op_code === '0x2eec4b61' ) {                 let rawBody = tx.transactions[index].out_msgs[i].raw_body??"";                 let slc = Cell.fromBase64(hexToBase64(rawBody)).beginParse();                 return loadCommitId(slc)             }         }     } catch (error) {         console.error("Error fetching data from TON API:", error);     } } (reply to 36721)

Nerses: How to convert Slice to Address  on chain ?

‚àÜyoseun: This function checks the transactions of an address onchain right? (reply to 36724)

Nerses: not on chain.it checks off chain.it gets all transactions of address,then checks for 'ext_out_msg' with certain emit opcode,after it just remains parsing the data (reply to 36733)

‚àÜyoseun: oh okay

‚àÜyoseun: Does this work for contracts too

‚àÜyoseun: because i am getting an empty array

‚àÜyoseun: It works for testnet?

Sumit: I want to ask how is transaction deduplications handled on ton?

Sumit: We have a bridge

Sumit: and we dont want to allow somebody to process a transaction again and again.

Alexander: You can create a smart contract whose address depends on the data of your transaction. By sending a message to initialize such a smart contract from another one, you can change its state to avoid re-execution. (reply to 36746)

Sumit: I got that but like creating a contract sounds like an overkill? (reply to 36747)

Alexander: Nope, for example in architecture of jettons (fungible tokens on TON), a smart contract is deployed for each user to store a balance, and other data for the particular user. When a user sends a token transfer request to his/her jetton wallet, that contract sends a message to the recipient's jetton wallet that will verify the source (by address calculation) (reply to 36748)

Sumit: Yes. I am aware of this architecture. But is there any other solution? (reply to 36750)

Alexander: I think it depends on your task, but I guess no. In TON, it is common to deploy smart contracts on each user just to keep bool variable. If your messages have an expire time, you maybe can keep a hashmap inside one contract and clean it of expired messages, but be aware that the gas cost of hashmap operations increases with it's size and you can stuck with gas limit (reply to 36751)

KinG: How I open task

Extiint: Yes you can do everything with one contract, but that's done to achieve scalability of storage so it would be very bad to use a different approach. On top of having compatibility problems with the major platforms ofc (reply to 36751)

Extiint: Simply use a map to store users info and your done

Extiint: But it's a terrible idea ahah

Anton: Tact‚Äôs CI has a Windows build with Blueprint, so I‚Äôm not sure about ‚Äúthe‚Äù issue (reply to 36899)

Lego: have you solve it, may i know the solution? (reply to 36788)

Bill: I heard there's a new contract protocol for issuing jettons, making transfers cheaper in terms of gas. Does anyone know about this? Are there any source codes or ready-made examples available?

Nikita: Hi all, does anyone know if there is any information about how much more suboptimal it is to use Tact? Or is there not much difference with FunC?

Anton: What is your definition of ‚Äúsuboptimal‚Äù? (reply to 36903)

Nikita: I talk about gas price (reply to 36905)

Anton: Tact is a higher-level language, so it‚Äôs easier to learn and build MVPs

Anton: It depends on what you are trying to achieve (reply to 36906)

Anton: What about correctness? (reply to 36906)

Anton: Are you sure your, let‚Äôs say, DeFi protocol is correct and your system won‚Äôt be drained of money if you have to deal with all the low level details FunC imposes on you?

Anton: I say you first should build robust solutions and only then measure and fix gas issues where they needed to be fixed and not indulge in premature optimizations

Nikita: You are right, I got your idea. Yes, I'm going to build staking contract and I have low experience in TON dev. I am experienced with Solidity and EVM btw, but in TON there significant differences from them.  Even if Tact forces to spend more money on gas, I am better start with Tact just to achieve my contract working well and later I can dive into gas optimizations with generated FunC contracts, i believe. Thanks for this idea, for some reason I didnt think about it. (reply to 36911)

Anton: Yeah, you can try to manually optimize the generated FunC code, however there are a couple more options: - Tact supports FFI with FunC code, so you can write some gas-critical parts of your project in FunC and link that code from Tact; - also, you can get in touch with us (the Tact team) and we might as well support your use case in the compiler if it will benefit the whole community in the long run (reply to 36912)

Nikita: Awesome, thanks! (reply to 36913)

Haris: Hey guys is there any open source contract which implements the bonding curve mechanism?

tony: Hello everyone! We are a team dedicated to building the TON ecosystem. We have developed several AI bots to assist with development. Currently, we have three bots: a bot to help with the issuance of Jetton tokens, a bot to assist in writing Tact, and a TON documentation assistant bot. We welcome everyone to give them a try!

Haris: please help? (reply to 36916)

Anton: we have some example documented here: https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact  but I cannot recall if there was the one you are asking for specifically (reply to 36920)

Son Pin: any example about verify signature in tact @AntonTrunov

Anton: did you check the Tact reference? (reply to 36922)

Son Pin: yes. it‚Äôs not clear

Haris: I could not find it (reply to 36921)

Anton: So is your question (reply to 36924)

Anton: What is not clear exactly?

Son Pin: An example about data of signatures , message, pubkey. To verify signature

Anton: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math#checksignature has a couple examples (reply to 36928)

Haris: please help? (reply to 36925)

Anton: Tact is a young language it probably does not exist until you implement it (reply to 36930)

–õ–µ–≤: Hello everyone, I code get fun function and want to return string type of data, but when I checked there on this website: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/, it is reply cell's code. How do I get a response in the form of a string

Guy: Hi, I have a design question regarding sharding.  Does it make sense to have a parent contract that deploys all child contracts and maintains a map of their addresses. In such a scheme, all requests are received by the parent contract and routed to the respective child contract. The parent remains relatively 'thin' but still holds a map. Or, should the parent deploy the child contract, and then have the users interact directly with the child contract? In this scheme the parent contract acts pretty much as a deployer and is very thin in the sense that no map is required. What are some pros and cons of each from your experience? Thanks in advance

Kishidle: Greetings again. Is there a way to send "Arrays" (or maps) as a Message? I'm not sure how to properly structure it

Alfred: Use a Map (reply to 36936)

Alfred: To create an array, define a map with an Int type as the key. This key will represent the index in the array. Additionally, include a variable to keep track of the number of items in the array.

Kishidle: I'm using a map right now (in the contract) but I'm not sure how to structure it for, say, sending a message coming from a webapp

Kishidle: Like I wish to send something like [0, 1, 2] into the contract and get the contract to save it

Alfred: Use Dictionary and bigint

Alfred: message Array {     data: map<Int, Int>;     length: Int; }

Alfred: data: Dictionary<bigint, bigint>;     length: bigint;

Alfred: It should work

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: gm i want to convert address in Tact to Int , is there anyway to do that ? thank for helping

Anton: Ints are 257 bit long and won‚Äôt fit addresses, which are 267 bits (reply to 37028)

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: thank for enlighten me sir im working with checkSignature(hash: Int, signature: Slice, public_key: Int) function for dynamic multisig what is the best way for hash to sign, im planing to use myAddress() can you give me some example for this case study (reply to 37030)

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: that mean hash should be unpredicted and built in contract

Daniil: address has two parts: workchain and hash. the hash part is 256 bits (reply to 37030)

Daniil: do you want to check the signature of some data? in this case the hash should be derived from data itself, not just some random value (reply to 37031)

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: yeah so i think contract address is kind of that data type we cant reuse in the future so its safe for multisig (reply to 37034)

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: hash is unique for each address right ? sir (reply to 37033)

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: and how we can get hash part from address ?

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: seems like we can create new address from workchain and hash  let oldTonFoundationAddr: Address =     newAddress(0, 0x83dfd552e63729b472fcbcc8c45ebcc6691702558b68ec7527e1ba403a0f31a8);  but dont have way to get

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: Cool can u give me more example sir

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: Btw what about using unix time for hash in signature

Nerses: is there any example of script how to send Jetton from jetton owner to arbitrary address ?

ashes: Does it consider good practice to use self.reply("Refund gas excess".asComment()); inside each receive func - to return the excess to user?

Alexandr: hi, i am using nativeReserve in my contract, sandbox tests passed successfully, but tx failed on testnet with exit code: 0 and result code: 34. does anybody knows whats the problem?

Tonion Dev: Hi Nerses when you try to send the token to someone else, the Jetton master contract computes the init.data and init.code and sends a Tx, if the receiver wallet has an instance of that Jetton wallet, it will receive the tokens and his balance will increment, otherwise, a new Jetton wallet will deploy for receiver and then the transferred token amount will be added to the receiver Jetton Wallet  you can find a sample of a function that calculates the init in Tonion   abstraction: https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/57e84a223798db5a43ffe57250baa0928a288ff2/contracts/traits/tokens/jetton/JettonMaster.tact#L36  implementation: https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/57e84a223798db5a43ffe57250baa0928a288ff2/contracts/mocks/tokens/jetton/JettonImp.tact#L18C1-L20C6  and the test case for transfer Jetton: https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/57e84a223798db5a43ffe57250baa0928a288ff2/tests/tokens/jetton/Jetton.behavior.ts#L115C5-L179C8 (reply to 37060)

Nwobueze: Yes (reply to 37096)

Howard: https://github.com/ton-community/vanity-contract  Can "mine" the smart contract address (reply to 37186)

M√∫j√¶mm√Æl: Hello

M√∫j√¶mm√Æl: How are you sir

hŒîrdshell: how do i convert EQ address into KQ?

hŒîrdshell: this is really really annoying

Max: Why would you need to do that? (reply to 37204)

hŒîrdshell: cause i need to find a jetton default wallet address (which differs per user)\

hŒîrdshell: and the getGetWalletAddress returns in a retarded format

Rahul: looking for a tact dev for a paid gig, dm if interested

Alexander: Use any of the SDKs that are available for multiple languages https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/apis/sdk, OR do it manually https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/addresses#user-friendly-address OR just to do it once by hand https://ton.org/address/ (reply to 37204)

Alexander: You don‚Äôt need to convert addresses for this, on the inside not depending on this ‚Äúprefix‚Äù both of them are representing the same address. Read some of the docs that I‚Äôve sent about to have a better understanding (reply to 37208)

Alexander: You could share the link to the transaction, and that will definitely help someone to help you :) (reply to 37190)

hŒîrdshell: if i put the EQ address in a function it doesnt work (reply to 37211)

hŒîrdshell: where as a plain string kQ works

Alexander: That's weird. In which environment are you trying to call this function? I mean language, SDK etc (reply to 37213)

hŒîrdshell: typescript with @ton/core

Alexander: Could you send a code snippet? Just this piece with the address (reply to 37216)

hŒîrdshell: tonconnect ui react

hŒîrdshell: sure

Alexander: Usually there‚Äôs some sort of Address.parse(‚Ä¶) that accepts any type of address and converts it to an Address type

hŒîrdshell: its already an address type and i tried that already also to convert to different version but doesnt seem to work or call it at all

hŒîrdshell: function convertEQtoKQ(eqAddress: string): string {     const address = Address.parse(eqAddress);     const kQAddress = address.toString({ urlSafe: true, bounceable: false });     return kQAddress;   }

Reed: I'm getting an error after upgrading to @tact-lang/compiler v1.4.1 I use the NFT template of "https://github.com/Ton-Dynasty/tondynasty-contracts", after build and deployed with @tact-lang/compiler v1.3.0 everything is fine, tonscan and getgems still recognize "Contract Type: NFT Collection", however after updating @tact-lang/compiler to v1.4.1, tonscan/tonviewer can't recognize "Contract Type" (Unknown), and getgems can't read NFT Collection anymore even though the contract is still the same. Does anyone know about this case, please help.

ashes: Hi, could someone explain - why JettonDefaultWallet doesnt implement the deployable trait? My goal is to deploy JettonDefaultWallet contract with some additional messages that are sent to the other contract when it receives token. https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact/blob/main/sources/jetton.tact

Alfred: Cause it's deployed on the fly when the wallet received the jetton

c9 üë®‚Äçüç≥: just thought forward_payload can be empty :-? (reply to 37307)

Alfred: Seems to be Invalid balance issue. Can you check if you have enough jetton to transfer? (reply to 37236)

Alfred: Usually, you need to mint some jetton to address A and then transfer from A's wallet to B.

Nerses: Hello everyone,  I'm excited to share a project I've been working on! We've developed a new protocol called PreHTLC, an evolution of the traditional HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contract) designed for crypto asset transfers. This protocol aims to facilitate truly permissionless and trustless cross-chain asset transactions.  We're providing a user-friendly UI along with the necessary links and access to our GitHub repository for those interested in diving into the code or providing feedback.  Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!  UI: https://layerswap.io/v8  GitHub: https://github.com/layerswap/layerswap-atomic-bridge

Illia: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/accept  Have a look at this. It explains side-effects of external messages (reply to 37312)

ashes: If the master jetton already been minted, is there a way to create a new instance of jettonWallet with some modifications (send additional message on receive)? As I see from the tact example - there's no way to do that, right? (reply to 37320)

Illia: theoretically, you could have done that; you could provide a setter that changes the code of the wallet that is going to be deployed if there's no wallet yet; but it's very much low-level thing that's, as of now, will be likely possible only though quite complex FunC engineering; therefore, practically, that's not the case in Tact yet;  what's your use case? you could change the architecture (reply to 37328)

ashes: I‚Äôm implementing the staking contract, and need to communicate with my staking contract via messages when user sends token to our hot wallet Jetton contract. Basically, user sends jettton to my wallet - my wallet sends the message to staking contract (reply to 37333)

Illia: That's embedded in the standard by default. You just need to set the payload and response_destination field accordingly to the TEP-74 standard (reply to 37334)

Nikita: Hi!  I'd like to know what can I use for hashing in Tact? All I found is workaround with Cell.hash, so first I need to build a cell with data I want to hash, but it seems strange for me, is it OK?

Illia: There are multiple ways to do that. You can do cell hash, slice hash and sha255 on slices in Tact. Check out https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math#sha256 (reply to 37336)

Alfred: If you have left the message to handle these use case, it should be doable. (reply to 37328)

Alfred: You should be able to receive  the transfer_notification(notify the receiver's owner) or the excess message(notify the sender). (reply to 37334)

ashes: I‚Äôve checked, but it‚Äôs still needs the modification of the Jetton contract, isn‚Äôt it? I cannot do any changes to it cause it‚Äôs been deployed (reply to 37335)

Austin: hi fam I'm working on an nft contract but I'm totally lost

Austin: can someone help me with a guide on writing nft contracts pls

Austin: Could not find any resource on the Tact Documentation

Illia: I'm referring to the original FunC implementation. There's no 'official' Tact Jetton implementation AFAIK. Are you creating your own implementation? (reply to 37342)

Illia: As far as I know, there's no such thing for tact. You can check ton docs for how nfts work  https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/tutorials/collection-minting and then implement the NFT contract compatible with TEP-62 (reply to 37345)

ashes: I cannot create my own, i have to work with the already deployed one - as I understand in this case I have to handle it outside of the blockchain, as you told me above (reply to 37348)

ashes: Check this out  https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-template-in-tact (reply to 37346)

Illia: If you have a Jetton that is already deployed and it's compatible with the TEP-74 standard, then you simply need to create a Transfer message (a cell that holds the data as described in the Transfer TLB scheme) as described in TEP-74 (reply to 37350)

Nikita: Hi! I want to create a contract that receives some jetton and burn it, and increasing caller address score. But I don't know how to achieve it... Is there any way to handle jetton transfer in contract? Even more, all this transfers handled by separate jetton wallet contracts, which, I ques, will be deployed for my contract after receiving jettons. So, perhaps someone knows or has any ideas? I would be really glad for any help

–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π: Posted an issue, thank you for advise (reply to 37590)

Daniil: overflow happens because you store "payload" in the same cell as the main part of the TokenTransfer  to fix this (and also to fix the underflow that occurs for you in real network) change your payload construction to this:  let payload = beginCell().storeBit(true).storeRef(StonfiSwap{       tokenWallet: myAddress(),       minOut: ton("0.1"),       toAddress: myAddress(),       referralAddress: null     }.toCell()).endCell().asSlice(); (reply to 37562)

I deployed a collection using this template: https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-template-in-tact?tab=readme-ov-file I minted NFTs, but tonviewer and tonkeeper doesn't see the NFT and collection metadata, whereas getgems shows all metadata correctly. What could be the issue? Thanks in advance for your help!

K…™·¥ç·¥è·¥†: Does tonviewer identify your contract as nft_collection? I believe not, because the template you mention doesn't use any standard traits. Use traits or @interface. (reply to 37865)

Nerses: Is there way to get any data (Int type) from c7 register ? In my code logic that data will be used after deployment

7n: Hi all, does anyone know why the tone has a weird seed phrase format, the standard ones don't fit?

Anton: you are using an outdated Tact version, most likely the one that does not support the bitwise XOR operator (reply to 37932)

Vesper: Hi there, as Tact bebeginner and FunC beginner do you have a good link or explanation between both and when to use one or the other?

Nerses: it is 1.2.0 (reply to 37939)

Anton: the current one is 1.4.1 (reply to 37941)

Nerses: I use in my contract fromSlice method.I get in this way message and send it to another party which cant execute it (exit code 130 Invalid incoming message) I think the main problem comes from wrong layout although cant figure out what is wrong. Couls someone give any hint or enlight how I can fix this ? here is the message and how i create layout which later is passed pas parametr to fromSlice https://gist.github.com/nerses-asaturyan/d4dc102cd9d20a24204a4f6dcc198aa0

Nerses: should I use it right after fromSlice ? CommitData.fromSlice(data).toCell() (reply to 37947)

Nerses: the gist code is used to send message, after it I use fromSlice . Where I should use toCell . I didnt get what you mean (reply to 37947)

Denis: Is it normal that jettons compiled with 1.4.1 via blueprint are not detected on tonviewer (at least in testnet)?  get_jetton_data is handled differently in the wrapper: readTuple() was added in 1.4.1. The jetton code itself is based on howardpen9's example edit: and all goes fine with 1.4.0

Anton: Will be fixed in 1.4.2 (reply to 37965)

Joel Mun: If u learn func first, tact is easy peasy

Joel Mun: Also i wanna mention that all important contracts on TON are written and deployed in func. So if u need to look into them (like jetton wallet contracts), u might wanna learn func too. Because it is inevitable that u interact with those contracts

Denis: You can find it in package-lock in dependencies of other packages) I just installed it myself with strict version(dependencies with ^) (reply to 38010)

Denis: I guess there are no package depends on latest version, so it should not be a problem (but better check it)

Fardin: Yep as u said its here (reply to 38012)

Denis: just execute npm i @tact-lang/compiler@1.4.0 If there are some package need last version, i guess npm should notify you) In this case you need to downgrade package, which depends on 1.4.1 (reply to 38014)

Naved: Hi everyone,  I'm reaching out today to seek feedback on a smart contract I've been working on. It's Nft contracts which allows only whitelisted users mint NFTs. it is managed by a WhitelistManager on which owners add users to whitelist it deploy new contract that stores users whitelist info. That contract can be call by the whitelist user. User call "mintNFT" to mint nft from two contracts Cards and Pets  I've posted the code on GitHub Gist: https://gist.github.com/nxved/217b473ba275ddfe582b4ad0a225ea01  I'm particularly interested in getting your insights on:  Security: Are there any potential vulnerabilities or exploits in the contract? Functionality: Does the code achieve the intended functionality as expected? Efficiency: Can the code be optimized for better gas usage or performance? Best Practices: Are there any coding practices or standards I should be following that I've missed? Any feedback or suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to learning and improving the contract, so please don't hesitate to point out any areas that could be better.

Georgiy: I just ran the static analyzer and skimmed through the contract in 5 minutes:  * Unused variable randomNum here. Did you forget to use it? * Why do you duplicate code here? * Hardcoded address: what if you would like to change the owner later? * RoyaltyParams should not be optional * What this hardcoded value means?

Nikita: Hey everyone again! I continue to fight against issue I texted about yesterday. Small updates from yesterday. I added dump for forward_payload I try to parse into struct (exact place where I get 9 exit code) and faced with strange behaviour. Here is place where I send message (jetton wallet contract): if (msg.forward_ton_amount > 0) {             dump(msg.forward_payload);             send(SendParameters{                 to: self.owner,                 value: msg.forward_ton_amount,                 mode: SendPayGasSeparately + SendIgnoreErrors,                 bounce: false,                 body: TokenNotification {                     queryId: msg.queryId,                     amount: msg.amount,                     from: msg.from,                     forward_payload: msg.forward_payload                 }.toCell()             });         }  and here is place where I receive it:  receive(msg: TokenNotification) {         dump("TokenNotification received".asComment());         self.requireJettonWallet(myAddress());         dump("wallet verification success".asComment());         dump(msg.forward_payload); }  And I see next in logs.

Joel: Lemme drop my two cents for all the devs here.   If you are asking a question, ask it properly. We dont know about what you are working on as well as your entire codebase.   What you choose to mention is the only info we have.   Dont ask questions as if you are dropping a bomb in haste and expect someone to answer you. Provide as much detail as you want to solve your problem and very preferably give a link to the entire codebase or at least all relevant parts.  And do the basic things.. format your code, get rid of typos, etc etc..

Nerses: Is it possible on the TON blockchain for one wallet to sign a message or transaction, and then have another wallet publish it, similar to how it's done in Ethereum? If so, how would this be implemented?

Mr. Badihi: what is the best want to convert String to Int .. it also might be negative. I tried this :         let slice: Slice = str.asSlice();         let user_id: Int = slice.loadInt(slice.bits());

Mr. Badihi: // Caution: produces unexpected results when String contains non-numeric characters! (reply to 38419)

Mr. Badihi: Also its not covering the neg nums

Mr. Badihi: yeah thats what im trying now

Nerses: how message signing is handled by wallets in the TON blockchain. Specifically, I'm interested in how this can be done programmatically, ideally with a code example. Additionally, does the process of signing a message depend on the version of the wallet being used?

Asahi: I tried compiling the Tact example from 07-jetton-standard, but I encountered the following error:   Incompatible types "Address" and "<null>" for binary operator "!=" Line 64, col 13:   63 |         self.total_supply = self.total_supply - msg.amount; // Update supply > 64 |         if (msg.response_destination != null) { // Cashback                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   65 |             send(SendParameters{  Has anyone else faced this issue? thanks

Anton: you don‚Äôt need to compare it to null, there is no point in doing so:   message(0x178d4519) TokenTransferInternal {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     from: Address;     response_destination: Address;     forward_ton_amount: Int as coins;     forward_payload: Slice as remaining; // Comment Text message when Transfer the jetton }   in the above response_destination already has type Address (reply to 38428)

Nerses: yeah I am mainly interested in it.Thanks for help and guidance (reply to 38435)

Anton: who knows? :) the Tact team just does not have the manpower to maintain tact-by-example, we only improve the official docs at the moment: https://docs.tact-lang.org (reply to 38432)

Asahi: The Tact example didn't provide a deployment script, so I wrote one on my own that should work. However, I have a question: the example doesn't mention how to configure the token's image or other related information. How should this be done? Thanks! (reply to 38437)

Ashwin: Yeah I never mentioned Tonkeeper. But I got you. Thanks

Ashwin: It's truly a shame that we can't use Telegram wallet for everything TON related. It would be a true unlock to the web3 eco

Ashwin: Not sure if many would be interested in downloading a wallet

Ashwin: even if it's inside telegram

Ashwin: For my particular usecase, I just want the users to  a) make a smart-contract call via their "telegram-wallet" or b) sign an off-chain message approving an action

Laisky: Thanks. I found the problem. I previously thought that initOf was the deployment, but it's actually not; it's just a local compilation. It is also necessary to send the code and data to the specified address. (reply to 38693)

Illia: 'there' is TON Tact Language Chat (reply to 38749)

Illia: very interesting syntax; try simply write x: Int = ton("100000000000");  100% this code would not compile on tact <= 1.4.0 'cause i was trying to multiply constants as well and it didn't work well (reply to 38747)

In every tutorial I wathched, devs using simplified version for TACT Jetton contract, only good modern contract I have found written in func, If we can't use TACT for deploy MAJOR contract like Jetton or NFT (accepted by getgems) why we need TACT at all?

Renat: Or at least can you please provide step by step tutorial how to build Dapp using mix, Jetton contract written on Func and other on TAct

Renat: I mean all TACT contract written 1 year ago and noone telling it is full implementation of Jetton, if you have it can you please provide link to repository? (reply to 38780)

Renat: in other words we have TEPs, and it will be very helpfull for newbies like me to provide implementations written in TACT

Maxim: This one should be absolutely complete for deployment, as I know. https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact

Dmitry: As far as i get it ton() multiplies argument by 10^smth. Do you really need 10^(smth*2)

Dmitry: Uint256 has less bits then Int (int257). But their max positive number is the same... So no reason to do that (reply to 38748)

Dmitry: Decimals are for ux on frontend or smth

Dmitry: All mathematics is applied to amount per se

–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π: If I discard the decimals, then the accuracy will be low

Dmitry: Which operation makes it low?

–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π: If you discard the decimal places, the calculations will not be accurate. For example 1.12 * 102.371 != 1 * 102

Dmitry: You got no decimal places if you store it in int as a minimal value   For "everyday currencies" you would have smth like  $: Amount=1000 Decimals=2  => You have 10.00$

Dmitry: Open up jetton standard/erc20

Dmitry: If your 1.12 has 9 decimals it would be stored as 11_2000_0000 (reply to 38893)

Dmitry: You have no "1.12" in your smart contract

–î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π: I know. 1120 and 102371 if we have 3 decimals (reply to 38897)

Vladislav: Hi, I got error if trying to make multiple mint of jetton token to multiple users in one message call, do you know why?  It works only if mint to one user

GANDI: As far as I understand, these are the specifics of TON. There's typically a 30-40 second delay between transactions, and you can't send another one immediately after.

GANDI: It's necessary to send one message and then loop it. This is a simple example and requires further refinement.

Abhishek: I have bought magnets media youtube course  If any buddy need let me know

GANDI: This is one of the examples. It needs further refinement, but it's a clear demonstration. Additionally, it's necessary to calculate the commission.  + "ctx.readForwardFee() * 3"

Nostra: Hey guys has anyone a template how to write the standard nft transfer method in tact for a getgems nft collection ?

Urban: The message (TokenNotification) does not even register. In fact it gets skipped on-chain: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/ccadeb75d238988a380eb08d7411793d9cd34579f290beed7480c7102891590f (cskio_no_gas). I try and transfer these with forward_amount as well but it's the same result: e.g.: https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/EQAuazI2Sz2U75XY9608OHn_GX7Y6t740hD0avck-t1ewNln?jetton=kQD0GKBM8ZbryVk2aESmzfU6b9b_8era_IkvBSELujFZPsyy&amount=1000000&fee-amount=100000000&forward-amount=20000000&text=Tests (reply to 39031)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: its probably error with this link cause it does not accept forward ton amount (reply to 39052)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: is this working? I thought you cannot use sender in init (reply to 39031)

Urban: Works both in tests and testnet ->https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQAuazI2Sz2U75XY9608OHn_GX7Y6t740hD0avck-t1ewGLt

Urban: hmm.. ok strange, did work on 2 tonkeeper wallets, but maybe I'm a snowflake here. Do you have any suggestions on how to better test/generate this transaction? Also not sure how to better test this locally. Right now I use this:  it('should top up usdt balance', async () => {         const jettonNotifyWalletResponse = await testWallet.send(             deployer.getSender(),             {                 value: toNano('0.05'),             },             {                 $$type: 'JettonNotify',                 queryId: 0n,                 amount: 10n,                 sender: customer.address,                 forward_payload: Cell.EMPTY.asSlice()             }         );          expect(jettonNotifyWalletResponse.transactions).toHaveTransaction({             from: deployer.address,             to: testWallet.address,             success: true,         });          const usdtBalance = await testWallet.getGetUsdtBalance();         expect(usdtBalance).toBe(10n);     }); (reply to 39053)

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: you could try just use testnet wallet seed phrase and try to send this transaction with forward_amount provided programmaticly

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä: im pretty sure it is an error with deeplink

thebatclaudio: Hello! I'm trying to deploy an nft collection on testnet, but on tonscan I see that "Contract Type" is "Unknown". I think that I'm writing the offchain content url in a wrong way, but I don't know how to debug.  So I'm asking: - Do you know how can I debug a deployed contract to read the content? (in this case, I need to check if my content url is the right one) - Do you have any other suggestions to debug deployed contracts?   Thank you!

Tom - Bushi: if I have to perform X messages between contracts and their order doesnt matter, is there any benefit to sending them out all at once over making a chain where one message and response triggers another?

Illia: from my experience, if you have a message that bounces for some reason, it will be easier to revert the changes if you have a smaller chain of transactions  e.g.  the chain: A -> B -> C -> D -> E  E bounces message, now D reverts changes and sends to C to revert changes, then C reverts and sends to B, etc.  if you have a chain like A -> E, then E bounces and A simply reverts changes  if you don't handle bounces, then it doesn't matter, but it's strongly recommended that you handle all bounces (reply to 39060)

Tom - Bushi: in my case it would be A->B -> A -> C -> A -> ... etc so I take it I can run them in parallel and it wont be some kind of anti-pattern? (reply to 39061)

Illia: i haven't seen real-world applications for this case  your contract can sand a maximum of 255 actions per one contract call  if you have <= 255 actions (send_raw_message = 1 action)  then i would just loop over them and send all the messages in one transaction  if you have more transactions, then it may have sense to sort of recursively transfer transactions;  whats you case (reply to 39062)

Tom - Bushi: dont think Ill be going over 255, but Ill see if I can make the chain just in case. Thanks for answering bud (reply to 39063)

Nerses: I'm working on a smart contract that involves verifying a signed message on-chain. The contract receives a message with several fields, including signature, data, and a few others. The contract first checks the validity of the signature before proceeding with any further logic.  I've implemented the off-chain message signing using ton-crypto and passed the signed message to the contract, but the signature verification fails on-chain. I'm not sure if I'm missing something in the signing process or if there's an issue with how the contract verifies the signature.  Could someone help me figure out what might be going wrong? I've provided the relevant parts of the code in this GitHub Gist. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

Laisky: jetton is not value, its just some number stores in your contract's variable. In contract A, you decrease a number by one, and then in contract B, you increase a number by one, thereby completing a transfer. (reply to 39444)

ÊæÄË∞∑Â∑•Á®ãÂ∏´: You can check the exit code on the tonviewer.com, it mean tx implmented succefully if the exit code is 0 (reply to 39445)

Nerses: I want to do that programitically (reply to 39447)

ÊæÄË∞∑Â∑•Á®ãÂ∏´: it‚Äôs complex. because the low level deisgn of ton

ÊæÄË∞∑Â∑•Á®ãÂ∏´: ton is async blockchain, it means you wouldn‚Äôt know the transactions status (even tx hash)after you send it

ÊæÄË∞∑Â∑•Á®ãÂ∏´: all you could do is that rembering the seqno and trace this tx until it on chain

Laisky: https://ario.laisky.com/alias/ton-converter share a simple conversion tool that may help with debugging

Nerses: I need exactly somehting like that.The  problem is I need to know if certain message ttriggered that tx was successfull or not. (reply to 39451)

Nerses: is there any code snippet or example how I should store somwhere seqno and trace andthen do that check ? (reply to 39451)

ÊæÄË∞∑Â∑•Á®ãÂ∏´: as my experience, you should store the seqno before you send tx, after you send the tx, check the seqno was increased 1

Nerses: but that doesnt mean smart contract processed the message successfull.As i can send message from my wallet to smart contract.The contract can fail to do something based on my message but my wallets seqon will increase as message is sent successfully (reply to 39455)

ÊæÄË∞∑Â∑•Á®ãÂ∏´: if seqno +1 it is generating data on chain successfully or it is fail

Laisky: poll and fetch the trace from https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/traces/<TX_ID>, until all children are complete (reply to 39453)

Nerses: can you give more insight what means all children are complete ? (reply to 39458)

ÊæÄË∞∑Â∑•Á®ãÂ∏´: If your observation object is a smart contract, you could parse all txs from this contract, and write a matcher to check the tx sender, after that, you could parse the message exit code

Laisky: here is an example https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/traces/521ce114ade4b4834df5ce8253429557320e4e2b8dcef205e312948acb167333  you can search "success" (reply to 39459)

Nerses: let me sum up the flow of that check. I parse incoming message to my smart contract store there for specific message its trace then poll and fetch untill all children are complete and then loop throw all children checking property success to be true. after all this I can be sure that the message by which the contract was triggered processed the message correctly (reply to 39461)

Laisky: make sense for me.  BTW, If you're just want to quickly check the status manually, you can view it directly here: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/da5602e0577cc3160c8ba4005f9e8a270545fffa4d181454383d10fc7d9eb630 (reply to 39462)

Blanco: Hello, if you don't mind, could you give me some advice? Let's say we have a pool from a platform like DeDust, and the pool has a method to get reserves, and I need to monitor changes in the reserves in real-time. Initially, I thought of doing it this way: subscribing to the transaction stream for the pool, and as soon as a new transaction comes in, calling the contract method. But I'm using RPC, and I don't have my own node. As a result, the request to get the reserves takes about 200ms. Is it possible to implement this faster, preferably in real-time?

jay: Can tact support nested object arrays?

jay: message SendItem { to: Address;     amount: Int as uint128; }  message BatchSend {     queryId: Int as uint64;     recipients: SendItem[];     message: String; }

jay: This will compilation failed.

jay: Yeah, maybe I should parse data from cell

jay: I found out that tact doesn't support loadDict

Nerses: what is the best approach to track transaction sucess ? Lets suppose I have smart contract and every time it receives message is done some operation based on that message,or fails if something is wrong in message.I dont emmit any event(as in TON it is useless).I cant figure out the flow how I should track the succesffull messages and be sure that for certain message the needed operation is done

Malik: I am new to ton What tooling do I need? Are nix modules available?

Champer Wu: It depends on what kind of the contract you are using (reply to 39558)

Champer Wu: If you are interacting with Jetton contract, the full pocess of it include 5 messages

Champer Wu: the process would be like A ->(sendBocReturnHash) -> TON A <-(return hash 0x1234) <- TON A-> getTxByHash -> TON A<- return(Tx HEADER and BODY) <- TON tracing the outMsg and do the processing above again

Nerses: I have the same contract for Jettons and also for native token.would like to listen both flows (reply to 39567)

Champer Wu: If you are interacting with Jetton , you could monitor the dest address and check the transfer notification was be executed

Champer Wu: or you could trace the path as I mentioned above

Nerses: In my smart contract on the TON blockchain, the protocol requires a user to complete two transactions for successful execution. To streamline the process, I've removed the need for the user to perform the second transaction themselves. Instead, during the first transaction, the user provides their signature, which allows an LP (Liquidity Provider) to execute the second transaction on their behalf.  I need to ensure that during the second transaction, I can verify that the provided signature indeed belongs to the user, using only the information available within the smart contract. Although one approach is to store the user's public key during the first transaction, I would prefer a more secure and efficient method, such as leveraging the TVM instruction ecrecover or other techniques to verify the signature's ownership without explicit key storage. What would be the best approach to achieve this?

Tom - Bushi: is there a good way to verify a transaction bounced with a specific error in the blueprint tests?

Piotr: But how does the process look like, that's what I'm having troubles understanding. So let's say someone created jetton, and they want to create vesting that will withdraw e.g. 100 coins to the beneficary address, how do I make transfer of the tokens to the beneficiary and how do I ensure that these "100 coins" are frozen until vesting cliff ends. Is there some guide to it in Tact docs? (reply to 39856)

Joaquim: tbh that's hard to explain here but the Tact docs should have everything you need go on DuckDuckGo and just search jetton tact vesting see if it yields anything (reply to 39904)

Anton: are you using SendRemainingValue? if that is correct, read this https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/send#outbound-message-processing (reply to 39991)

IMDb: Yes, I use SendRemainingValue when mint

IMDb: Is this a problem, @AntonTrunov ?

Anton: Check out the link (reply to 39995)

IMDb: Yea, I checked but nothing special?

Cyril M |: sending remaining value on first message will send all the unused value. meaning the rest of the message wont be sent due to lack of gas

IMDb: Oh, that was it...

IMDb: üôè

Cyril M |: only use send remaining value on the very last message you send

IMDb: Thank you, @cyrilns, @AntonTrunov

Cyril M |: also this is optional depending on your goal (reply to 40001)

Anton: Your precise case is explained there, check again (reply to 39997)

Cyril M |: and make sure you have enough gas for all the message. use bounce: true to return the gas if transaction fails

IMDb: Actually I was testing Jetton token contract on this example: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard

IMDb: Here mint function was scheduled to use send with mode of SendRemainingValue.

Cyril M |: this example is outdated, you will have issues on decimal soon (reply to 40007)

Cyril M |: specially in burning tokens and no one will ever help you regarding it

IMDb: Oh, is it outdated?

Cyril M |: yes

IMDb: Where can I check the Jetton token contract example?

IMDb: Made by tact language

Cyril M |: i did some research few days ago. all of the examples were years ago

Cyril M |: i just follow the standard and created my own jetton and wallet

Cyril M |: is it possible to have array as input in tact?

Joaquim: Yes. Check the tact-lang cookbook/data-structures (reply to 40040)

Anton: depends on what kind of array you‚Äôd like  arrays simulated with maps: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/data-structures#array  short bit arrays: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/163 (reply to 40040)

Cyril M |: what's the max length an array can hold as input?

Tiqan: Hey i somehow get error when deploying a contract with blueprint.  AxiosError: timeout of 5000ms exceeded. Does anyone have an idea on how to fix this?

blocksdev: It‚Äôs a network issue (reply to 40044)

Tiqan: And what can I do then?

Nerses: thanks a lot (reply to 40051)

Jb: Hey have you found something similar to the abi.encodepacked or keccak for solidity? (reply to 40052)

Nerses: //     let hashlockFromSecret: Int = sha256(hashlockFromSecretSlice); (reply to 40055)

Jb: But sha256 uses sha2 while keccak uses sha3

Jb: And related to encoding like the abi.encodepacked?

Jb: I think the keccak can be done in fift though

Nerses: the previous code is analog of this solidity code in TACT sha256(abi.encodePacked(secret)) . I dont know how it works under the hood but in this way they gave same result (reply to 40058)

Jb: Ok thanks

Jb: Yeah but there are sometimes instead of sha256, solidity uses keccak256() which is a higher version of the sha

Jb: I saw in the dec2023 upgrade they added it but only through fift

Anton: will be available in Tact v1.5 through asm-functions, now you can do kind of the same but via FunC bindings (reply to 40063)

Jb: Do you have any resource please? (reply to 40064)

Anton: well, I‚Äôm the one who added the feature, lol  https://t.me/tact_kitchen/30 (reply to 40065)

Jb: Hahaha thanks, is that usable?

Jb: Meanwhile, do you have some func code to do that?

Anton: we are already using it in the Tact standard library (reply to 40067)

Jb: But is it available for usage? Can I import it somewhere?

Jb: Thanks!

Jb: Do you have the complete code for this? Seems cut . Thanks! (reply to 40056)

Nerses: oops.just saw that some part has been cut.          let hashlockFromSecretSlice: Slice = beginCell().storeUint(msg.secret,256).asSlice();         let hashlockFromSecret: Int = sha256(hashlockFromSecretSlice); (reply to 40073)

Jb: sorry I am having trouble importing the stdlib, where do I import it from, the tact-lang repo? Also how do I import it, as import "./stdlib" or import "@stdlib/..."? (reply to 40071)

Cyril M |: is there a way for sending message in typescript without the need to prompt from a wallet app? use mnemonic seed phrase to sign the transaction programmatically?

Jb: Hey sorry, do you have any insights on how to import the updated stdlib on tact? Since the asm is not in the npm package. Thanks! (reply to 40071)

‚Å≠: I have 2 advanced questions about ton in general, not closely really related to tact, but still.  1) Is there a possibility to vanitygen contract address like in ethereum? or it's not really forecastable?  2) Any example of proxy-smart contract on ton? is it economically economically justified for user to create them? It would be few cents or few dollars?  Thanks.

Vladimir: I try to write upgradeable smart contracts but a bit confused    - in tact docs it's saying it's not possible  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/upgrades   - I have found set_code instruction discussion  https://answers.ton.org/question/1597038683951730688/are-there-set-code-examples  - I have found upgradeable tact contract   https://github.com/wedvjin/ton-tact-contract-upgrade/blob/master/contracts/tact_v1.tact   So what is the current status of tact upgrades?  What risks a potential problems I should worry about?  How storage layout works in Tact?

Anton: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/27 (reply to 40163)

Vladimir: Thank you. As I understood, no problem with new logic, but better to not touch the storage :-)  I think I can use the hack and just create a map  Map(Uint256=>Uint256) keyValueStorage  Which I will be able to use for anything if I really will need new data variables in future (reply to 40164)

Vladimir: found this but would like to see end-2-end example with some data signed by JS code and verified in contract - https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-math#checkdatasignature

Daniil: Hi guys!  Does anybody know how to calculate a hash of the struct?  I receive internal msg with struct Item: struct Item {     prop1: String;     prop2: String;     prop3: String;     prop4: String; } and I wanna save its hash with price in a small map like a catalog. If I use  sha256(msg.item.toCell().asSlice())  it returns the same hash for all incoming items (probably because it hashes only ref cell). So what is be the best approach of hasing a stuct with string fields (taking into account, that sha256 is relatively havy hash func and I can stand with lighter hashing)?

Vladimir: after I deploy my contract sending 0.05 TON i expect it to have some TON as a reserve to pay for storage  however, as i can see from the deployment transaction, the rest of unused TON was returned to the deployer  https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQAU9WyB6u_gDm1RfJa6SDiPYVmMnb2GWUSQrfbJ7iepx8cq#transactions  is it OK? how can I change it and leave some TON on the contract balance after deployment?

blocksdev: its completely okay,i believe  you change that behaviour in the init() part of the contract. (reply to 40218)

Vladimir: i dont have anything related to the returning TON back       init(         id: Int,         verifierPubKey: Int     ) {         self.id = id;         self.owner = sender();         self.verifierPubKey = verifierPubKey;     }  i am just afraid that if my contract will have 0 balance after deployment it can be removed since it cant pay for storage (reply to 40219)

blocksdev: then maybe its just default behaviour. you should read this NativeStorage and Deploy. (reply to 40220)

Jb:          let builder_0: Builder = beginCell().storeUint(123456, 256)                     .storeUint(msg.maxSequenceTimestamp, 64);         let builder_1: Builder =  beginCell().storeUint(123456, 256);         builder_0.storeRef(builder_1.endCell()) I just put some random dummy values to test

Jb: I guess it makes sense because it doesnt store the ref cell in the value of the cell.

Jb: But I was wondering if there was a way to pack everything and hash it.

Nerses: //     .storeAddress(myAddress()).storeAddress(ctx.sender).storeUint(ctx.value, 120)             //     .storeRef(beginCell().storeRef(msg.data.dstChain.asSlice().asCell()).storeRef(msg.data.dstAsset.asSlice().asCell())             //         .storeSlice(msg.data.dstAddress.asSlice()).endCell())             //     .storeRef(beginCell().storeRef(msg.data.srcAsset.asSlice().asCell()).storeAddress(msg.data.srcReceiver)             //         .storeUint(msg.data.timelock, 64).storeAddress(msg.data.messenger).endCell())             //     .endCell().hash(); (forwarded from Nerses)

Nerses: I have done something like this.trying to solve the problem you mentioned (reply to 40387)

Nerses: Are you sure that in b_0 there isn't all data you stored? (reply to 40383)

Jb: Yeah, I dumped both of hashes and they give the same. With the store ref and without it.

Nerses: Very interesting. I will try to do same tomorrow and figure out (reply to 40391)

Jb: Ok, me the same. I‚Äôll update you if I find something. But at first the most logical thing to do is load the refs.

cubby: Hello. Is anyone looking for a blockchain engineer?

Laisky: I have a thought that I‚Äôm uncertain about: the TON protocol does not have built-in defenses against message replay attacks. This means that an attacker could replay historical messages, and contracts must implement their own defense against replay attacks using a nonce. Is that correct?

dotfx: Hi! After sending some ton to another account, is myBalance() immediately updated and can be called within the same function?

Anton: does this answer your question? https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-common#mybalance (reply to 40408)

dotfx: thanks! (reply to 40409)

Anton: if you know the concept of send works, then it should be immediate that myBalance cannot be updated: send just adds a message to the message queue, there is no actual send after executing that line of code with send (reply to 40408)

Nerses: Hi everyone,  I‚Äôm building a smart contract that needs to send notifications (messages) to users for certain events. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a standard message format or structure that works with different wallet versions. My aim is to make sure these notifications are compatible across various wallets so all users get them.

Urban: when creating custom messages.. is there a guideline how to generate the opcode?  Example: message(0x03c672ca) WithdrawTokens {}   I know its not mandatory, but it's a pain in the ass to always go looking into the compiled code and finding the generated opcode, that I then use in scripts

Nerses: you can fix your opcode. (reply to 40482)

Urban: I know. But is there a guideline or just random 32bit and go nuts?

Nerses: I havent seen any,but maybe I am mistaken (reply to 40484)

Anton: no, there are no real guidelines, go nuts :)  two points worth mentioning, though:  - to communicate with contracts written by others you have to specify their message opcode, of course;  - don‚Äôt use 0 as opcode, as it is reserved for text messages (Tact v1.5 will be complaining if you try this) (reply to 40484)

Jb: Hello, how do you deal with data such as hashes that return uint256 and need to store it in runtime function that converts it to Int257. Example: fun getRoot() : Int {         let node: Int = 0;          node = sha256(values to be hashed);    return node }  Will my node be of type uint256 or break it into int257?

dotfx: map<Int as uint32, Int as coins>  with value declared as Int as coins, compiler crashes with value: Int as uint256 or not even specifying a serialization, everything is ok

Laisky: This is not just a tool, it‚Äôs a template code includes Jetton & NFT. You can do whatever you want by copy and modify the source code.  Next, I plan to rewrite it into a trait that is easier to modify. (reply to 40511)

Nerses: I‚Äôm working on a TACT smart contract where I need to send a text message to users that includes some variable data.

Urban: A question regarding tests. I have a contract that does some processing when it recieves a jetton (via transfernotification msg) and then if certain conditions are met it also triggers an outbound transfer.

Does anyone have an example of *test* where you test minting / transfers / notifications / ....

&rey: Of which block, precisely? (reply to 40568)

Jb: Actual

&rey: From which language? At least, backend or frontend?

Jb: In tact

Jb: Inside a smart contract

&rey: You know that block hash is determined by all block contents and is therefore undefined at contract execution time?

&rey: Block height... of shardchain or masterchain? Though, neither is accessible inside contracts IIRC.

Jb: No, I did not know that.  I wanted to do something like this in solidity:             uint256 lastBlockHash = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));

&rey: Oh. This might have some solution.

&rey: I feel this is basis for unsafe code. What are you trying to achieve?

&rey: You need TVM asm intrinsic. For opcodes, look here (and a bit above the position on page): https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-upgrade-2023-07#opcodes-to-work-with-new-c7-values. (reply to 40579)

Anton: üéâ Tact v1.5.0 has just been released  The new Tact release v1.5.0 just landed on NPM! Here are the highlights of the most important features.  üõ† New Tact features  asm functions allow you to access the deep dark corners of TVM for more features or better performance:    asm fun keccak256(s: Slice): Int {     1 INT HASHEXT_KECCAK256 }   asm functions have some limitations at this point and the Tact team will make them even more powerful in the next releases.  - A wider range of serialization options for integers can now be used, not just 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256-bit integers, but anything in between: uint1 through uint256 and int1 through int257. For instance, a 48-bit timestamp can be defined now if you'd like to build contracts that can work after the year 2038:   contract Contract {     timestamp: Int as uint48 }   - Constant definitions now support calls to user-defined functions and references to other constants:   const CONSTANT: Int =     myFunction(OTHER_CONSTANT)   üë©‚Äçüíª New builtin and stdlib functions and methods  - The exists method for the Map type: m.exists(key) which is equivalent to m.get(key) != null.  - The deepEquals method for the Map type: m1.deepEquals(m2) -- you can now easily compare two maps with the same key-value pairs and get true as the result, even if their internal representations are different, so the hash-based == comparison would return false.  - The toSlice method for structs and messages: struct.toSlice().  - The new slice, rawSlice, ascii and crc32 built-in compile-time functions to help you define constant integers and slices more conveniently.  - The new stdlib functions to help with fee calculations: gasConsumed, getComputeFee, getStorageFee, getForwardFee, getSimpleComputeFee, getSimpleForwardFee, getOriginalFwdFee, myStorageDue. This brings you access to the TVM instructions from 2023.07 and 2024.04 upgrades.  - The parseStdAddress and parseVarAddress stdlib functions allow you to parse slices into structured addresses.  üêû The new release also includes a bunch of bugfixes. Thanks to all the Tacticians for all the issues you open!  üìú Full changelog for Tact v1.5.0: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#150---2024-09-15 (forwarded from TON Dev News)

traceur: This is part of the  code in my receive function, which call‚Äôs another smart contract. Is it because I set the mode to SendRemainingValue, that the remaint 34.9 ton are all sent to another contract?

traceur: Yes I‚Äôm using deployable trait, but my test is based on other recevier function, so it should not be a problem. (reply to 40701)

As I was deploying airdrop contract and trying to transfer method, I got an error.   https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQAx66S9GCN9e9iNeMBEng_vIw4UO0422khgfIvwJTt5sj8n  You can check contract here and there are failed transactions.   Please help me urgently.  Thanks

Denis: Hello! Can't find answer by search: In tact by example forward_payload has Slice type(as remaining) But in docs on official site it has Cell type. What option is correct?  We have both variants in mainnet (from two different teams) and i need to communicate with both. Should i separate them, or it's fine to pass argument with cell type (in tests Slice version accept Cell, but not vice versa). P.S. in theory we can redeploy Slice version if nothing wrong with Cell and it's be better for future interactions.

Jb: Hello , is there any other way to handle infinit maps rather than deploying a contract for each key?

poppa: Theoretically possible but doing so would circumvent the scaling features of TON, and if your account chain's state becomes very large by way of many many entries to this mapping, the rent would be quite high. Sharding the state is a superpower, not a limitation. (reply to 40862)

Jb: Yep but how can I use that opcode? (reply to 40891)

Anton: do you need full info from that instruction or just some specific part? (reply to 40892)

Jb: Just how to use it in tact. For example the return types or how to destructure it. What I need is the blockhash or block id mainly. (reply to 40893)

Anton: Tact currently does not really support tuples, but if you only need some specific part of the block information, you could have done something like this (beware of bugs in the following code, I didn‚Äôt test it):   struct BlockId {     wc: Int;     shard: Int;     seqno: Int;     root_hash: Int;     file_hash: Int; }  asm fun prevKeyBlock(): BlockId {     PREVKEYBLOCK     5 UNTUPLE }   Btw, Sandbox does not emulate blocks, so all those tuples should be empty in your local tests. (reply to 40894)

Jb: Ok I did exactly the same but the untuple, and was getting a parsing error. Will try with it. Thanks

Jb: But do you receive undefined or an empty data? (reply to 40895)

Anton: Can I see your full code please? (reply to 40903)

Jb: I did not use 1.5 because I could not solve the compilation errors so I am using func bindings.  The code is:

Jb: for the func file: tuple prevKeyBlock() asm "PREVKEYBLOCK 5 UNTUPLE";  and in my tact contract:  @name(prevKeyBlock) native prevKeyBlock(): BlockId;  struct BlockId {     wc: Int;     shard: Int;     seqno: Int;     root_hash: Int;     file_hash: Int; }      get fun getPrevKeyBlock() : BlockId {         let block: BlockId =  prevKeyBlock();         return block;     }  I think the error might be in the declaration of the variable block inside the get fun

Anton: prevKeyBlock in your FunC code should return a tensor (int, int, int, int, int), not a tuple tuple or not even a concrete tuple [int, int, int, int, int] (reply to 40906)

–°–µ–≤–∞: Hello how can I deploy contract from the code? In my dapp I click on a button and a new jetton minter will be created

‚Äî 2024-09-23 ‚Äî

kk: helloÔºå I would like to ask if there is a significant difference in functionality between Tact language and FunC language. I am accustomed to using typescript language in my daily life. Which language should I learn for developing TON

üå±SEED üì¶ Bums: Hello, can I find anyone to help me here?

‚Å≠: is there any example of bid/ask structure/state on smart contract?

mgnfy_view: Are there some good examples available for common stuff like, transferring Jetton from user to contract, contract to contract, interacting with other contracts, etc?

Georgiy: I would start from here: https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact?tab=readme-ov-file#-smart-contracts-examples.  There are other examples available, some of them could be found on GitHub. Just extend this search with code patterns you are interested in: https://github.com/search?q=path%3A*.tact&type=code. (reply to 41040)

Georgiy: See the main page: https://tact-lang.org/  tl;dr: Tact is a safer, more high-level alternative that won't let you shoot yourself in the foot with error-prone low-level stuff. But in some projects you'll need to write some logic in FunC and integrate it to Tact in order to optimize things or involve low-level constructions. (reply to 41036)

Jiego: hey guys, quick question:  Lets say i wanted to implement something similar to https://tact-by-example.org/06-unbounded-arrays   A todo list is pretty simple, but lets say i want to offer this to several users. In that case, what are some ideas to implement a basic auth here, as it would defeat its purpose if anyone could go and interact with the parent contract, modifying other users todo list.

Jiego: in my current proyect i ended up created a map storing some basic info for each todo, but im guessing that would be too scalable on the long term

Jiego: something like:  1) user creates a list, on the parent contract i store their address and the id on a map 2) on a third contract i want to check the state of the child-todo, so i would need to use the parent-todo to access the auth info and deny access to the user if its not the owner 3) the parent-todo could get clogged if billions of users got in

Jiego: any ideas?

8exor ü¶¥: hey guys i need help in contract integration with  React app

Jiego: whats the issue there? (reply to 41048)

Nerses: Is there any issue on testnet right now ? As this simple check doesnt pass require(timelock > now(),"Not Future Timelock");  with correct timelock. And also interacting with smart contract very often gives error 504

Nerses: can loading data from received message reorder data ?  let Id: Int = msg.data.preloadInt(257);         let hashlock: Int = msg.data.preloadInt(257);         let timelock: Int = msg.data.preloadInt(257);   as I emit timelock  but actually it emits Id . what can cause this ?

Anton: because you use preloadInt, it does not change your slice pointer (reply to 41052)

Nerses: is there any method to change pointer ? So i can reference to next 257 bits ? (reply to 41053)

Anton: Why do you actually need that? What problem are you trying to solve? Because you might be able to just describe your data using the syntax of structs as far as I can tell from your snippet (reply to 41054)

Nerses: here is the full code receive(msg: AddLockSig){         let Id: Int = msg.data.preloadInt(257);         let hashlock: Int = msg.data.preloadInt(257);         let timelock: Int = msg.data.preloadInt(257);         require(self.contractExists(Id),"Contract Does Not Exist");         let htlc: HTLC = (self.contracts.get(Id)!!);         require(checkSignature(msg.data.hash(),msg.signature,htlc.senderPubKey),"Invalid signature");         let addLockMessage: AddLock = AddLock{                                                 Id: Id,                                                 hashlock: hashlock,                                                 timelock: timelock                                                 };         let ctx: Context = context();         self.addLock(addLockMessage,ctx);     }   in this receive  is done signiture verification and based on data  which has 3 fields id  hashlock  and timelock  is executed the function addLock. I tried to use fromSlice  but it wouldnt work as I dont have opcode in data only properties

Anton: what about this?   message AddLockSig {   ‚Ä¶   data: Lock;   ‚Ä¶ }  struct Lock {   id: Int;   hashlock: Int;   timelock: Int; }

Nerses: so just to encapsulate on struct inside another ? (reply to 41058)

Anton: an idiomatic way to write this would be using struct fields punning:   let addLockMessage: AddLock =   AddLock{ Id, hashlock, timelock} (reply to 41057)

Anton: sure (reply to 41059)

Nerses: I thought that way but was avoiding it in purpose of simpler solution (reply to 41061)

Anton: but manually reading things is not simpler (reply to 41063)

Anton: you can even remove the type annotation:   let addLockMessage = AddLock{ Id, hashlock, timelock} (reply to 41060)

Nerses: thanks a lot.In that case I will use that approach (reply to 41064)

shi: when send jetton, how to calc jetton wallet address??

Laisky: https://github.com/Laisky/tact-utils/tree/main there are a lot of samples using nativeReserve in this repo (reply to 41245)

Laisky: I think your question is very strange. If you want to transfer jetton/NFT, then you must know the contract code, and therefore, initof must be able to get the correct address.  BTW, even if the target contract doesn't exist, the message can still be delivered, unless you set bounce: true. (reply to 41242)

shi: for example, i want write this function ,how to get the target's jettonWalletAddress fun transferJetton(jettonMasterAddress: Address, amount: Int, target: Address) { (reply to 41273)

shi: how to get the contract code?

shi: just use JettonWalletTemplate?

Dmitriy: you only need to know your jetton wallet address when sending jettons as for recepient, you need the recipient address, not recipient‚Äôs jetton wallet one, it will be calculated by your jetton wallet, so it‚Äôs not your concern  you should know your jetton wallet address, so there should be no problems in it (reply to 41271)

shi: but i only know the recipient wallet address and jetton master address. in nodejs i can use runMethod to get the jetton wallet address, but how to calc jetton wallet address in tact? (reply to 41277)

shi: calc jettonWalletAddress must use jettonWalletCode

Dmitriy: does your contract work with some limited set of jettons, or with every possible jetton? (reply to 41279)

shi: every possible jetton, like dedust

Dmitriy: it makes things harder in case of some limited set of jettons, I‚Äôd sugget you to store the map from jetton master address to jetton wallet address in your contract  then you need to accept the jetton wallet address (or cell with code) as an input in your tact contract to calculate jetton wallet address from it in general it‚Äôs impossible to calculate jetton master -> jetton wallet address mapping since different jettons may have different code (reply to 41282)

Dmitriy: there is also a discoverable jettons standard (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md) where jetton master has provide_wallet_address method to return (asynchonously, of course) the jetton wallet address  but not every jetton is a discoverable jetton, so you can‚Äôt rely on it

Dmitriy: so you either need to rework your contract to support only some whitelisted set of jettons or accept jetton wallet address (or code) as an argument but for the latter case you also need to come up with some validation to make sure that jetton wallet address indeed corresponds to a certain jetton master

Tom - Bushi: thx Laisky, in fact I learned about this function from your blog post. But you seem to only use SendRemainingBalance while I would like to use SendRemainingValue. The contract might be accepting payments in TON so sending remaining balance seems risky (reply to 41272)

Cyril M |: Hi guys, I just created an Access Control trait. It's a role-based access control  https://github.com/ed3ath/tact-access-control  contributions are welcome

Anton: looks like struct UserRoles could benefit from associated extension functions that incapsulate working with the map length (reply to 41293)

Anton: also, for roles you might use a smaller integer, let‚Äôs say 8-bit or even 4-bit integer

Jb: Hello, I am dealing with an async problem here.  I am trying to create infinite maps, and a solution proposed is to deploy a new mapping on an empty contract that holds that value such as jetton does. Every time I execute a function in my c ontract, the a new value is inserted in the mapping, and each value is related to each other like a chain. And I need to also query the new contract. My problem comes when that call might fail, and I need to revert changes. I tried putting a bounced method but it is not easy to revert a hashchain  in the mapping, moreover when I might have many calls at the same time.

Georgiy: Looks good. I would remove roles_length as it was reported as unused by the static analyzer. (reply to 41293)

Jose Fabio: Hello. Can someone please explain to me why SendMode 3 is the standard? Why not 1?  I don't get why is it a standard to ignore errors.

Jose Fabio: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/messages

Jose Fabio: Tact's documentation says The optional flag SendIgnoreErrors means that even when an error occurs during message sending next messages would be sent anyway. No error during the sending phase would revert a transaction.  It doesn't explain why many people use it. Is it safe? Wouldn't it be desirable to revert a transaction if an error occurs?

Vincent: Hi guys i have a question , when a recieve("message") is called does this mean it will call the function message in the contract ?

‚Å≠: any method to get user balance? for example if he bid the value without sending it we need to check balance of the sender address

Jiego: No, it Will call whatever is inside the receiver function receive("message"), but only that. The common function message needs to be inside the receiver "message" in order to be called (reply to 41379)

Jiego: Easier to declare a Context and check msg.value inside the receiver function (reply to 41380)

Vincent: I see , correct me if im wrong so lets say i want to have 2 function 1 is to increase something and another is to decrease so i need to have 2 recieve function but how would i differentiate it ?

‚Å≠: msg.value seems value which was sent, if value is less than balance or even just to pay fees, like on fragment they may bid without sending funds (reply to 41382)

Jiego: Sorry I meant like this https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-common#context (reply to 41384)

Vincent: oh so the receive function couldnt take in 2 params

Jiego: Receive("increase") {self.value = self.value+1}  Receive("decrease") {self.value = self.value-1} (reply to 41383)

Jiego: It can, but instead of a "message" you would need to send a msg: Message. Say: (reply to 41386)

Vincent: Oh so like  message RegisterMessage { str: "register" struct: Data { ..... } } (reply to 41388)

Jiego: Receive(m: Increase) {self.value = self.value+m.valueToBeAdded}  Receive(m: Decrease) {self.value = self.value-m.valueToBeSubtracted}

Jiego: If I have message X { a: Int, b: Bool, c: Address } and I send that from one contract to another, is there anyway i can edit any part of the message itself?

Laisky: You should provide a clearer description of who is performing the action. (reply to 41469)

Jiego: user is sending message X { a: Int?, b: Bool, c: Address? }  as user does not know c, on parent i want to do something like msg.c = someAddress

Nerses: Does testnet work now ?

Nerses: I get error 429 trying to deploy smart contract

Vladislav: Sha256 does everything by rounds. I assume you can implement your own sha256 that pulls data iteratively from cells and their refs and put everything in other cells. Sort of. The main peril here is that it's unattractive to debug it. Also, tx cost isn't cheap  If that's possible use another algorithm (CRC f.e., but I wouldn't use it if data is sensitive) or even Merkle trees based on easier hash (reply to 41809)

Sergey: Guys, hello.  Could you please help me?  I'm building a payload to send jetton like this:   transferPayload := cell.BeginCell().  MustStoreUInt(sendJettonOpCode, 32).  MustStoreUInt(uint64(messageID), 64).  MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromDecimal(fmt.Sprintf("%f", amount), jettonData.Decimals).Nano()).  MustStoreAddr(h.contractAddress).  MustStoreAddr(parsedSenderAddress).  MustStoreBoolBit(false).  MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromTON("0.05").Nano()).  MustStoreBuilder(forwardPayload).  EndCell()   also I calculate jettonAddress of the sender this way:   token := jetton.NewJettonMasterClient(api, address.MustParseAddr(jettonData.MasterContract))  senderTokenWallet, err := token.GetJettonWallet(ctx, parsedSenderAddress) if err != nil {  h.log.Error().Err(err).Msg("failed to get wallet for sender")   return "", "", err }   but when I'm trying to send such transaction i see this.   if i send such transcation i will get 49 exit code. I couldn't find any info about this code.   but the most interesting part - the same code works perfectly in testnet.   maybe someone can help me?

Sergey: also the same happenes with the usdt

Max: Hey guys, suppose we want to build a simple lending protocol, can we use maps to store balances of users with addresses? I realize its not the most efficient solution, but can it work?  What‚Äôs the current limit on the amount of data that can be stored in maps?

Anton: Basically it‚Äôs 10s thousands of entries (reply to 42256)

Max: So for example, if we limit the number of loans to 5,000, we‚Äôre good? (reply to 42257)

Anton: Should be fine, but you really need to stress test it before doing that in production (reply to 42258)

Laisky: Generally, Do not store any user data in your contract; create an independent wallet contract for each user to save their own data. (reply to 42256)

Max: Yes, but imagine that a main contract determines the price of the collateral, and when the price falls below a certain point, it needs to liquidate loans where the collateral ratio is below acceptable.   You‚Äôd need to store borrowers and their positions in the main contract, otherwise you‚Äôd need a system with off-chain tracking like Liquity (reply to 42261)

Laisky: absolutely, just initOf a new contract then check the address (reply to 42469)

Tiqan: But for initOf I would need the data of the other contract

Laisky: Indeed, if you don't know the initial data of the other party, you can't verify its address. However, you can simply compare the code of the two contracts off-chain. (reply to 42471)

Prateek: can anybody tell me what is wrong

dotfx: Use a double !! after your variable as it could be a null instead of an Int (because you marked it as optative) currentShares!! + sharesBought

dotfx: This way you're forcing it to be interpreted as an Int datatype

Prateek: let currentShares: Int? = self.userShares.get(key);          if (currentShares == null) {             self.userShares.set(key, sharesBought);          } else {             let current: Int = self.userShares.get(key)!!;             self.userShares.set(key, current + sharesBought);          } this worked

Laisky: In TON, there is no distinct deploy operation; only messages. When you send a message to an address that includes code and data, the contract is deployed at the same time as it's called. You can include any amount of TON coins in the message. (reply to 42609)

Laisky: That's a great question! I realized that I made an error earlier: the TransferNotification should be sent to the newOwner, not to the responseDestination. As a result, I have modified the Staking process, and it is no longer necessary to pre-deploy the staking wallet contract.  https://github.com/Laisky/tact-utils/tree/main/contracts/staking (reply to 42316)

Holst üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Hello everyone! My name is Sergey, and I‚Äôm with the DeFi Canvas project. We participated in the TON Bootcamp from October 11-13, and now we are #lookingfor reinforcements.  We are preparing a DeFi product for TON Hackers, aiming to release an MVP by the end of November. Currently, we are looking for:  - Frontend Developer: Experienced in TWA, React, and API integrations. Knowledge of TON is a plus. FunC/Tact Developer: Knowledge of TWA, swap functions, and liquidity interactions.  We already have a concept, mockups, a testnet solution, and a working backend. Now, we are finalizing the scope, prioritizing features, and distributing tasks. As a startup, we are budget-conscious and primarily focused on earning rewards from TON Hackers winter. However, we have a small budget to cover operational expenses for the next month.  If you're interested or know someone who might be, feel free to DM me for more details. Thanks, everyone! :)  P.S. Most of our team members are ru-speaking

Jb: Hello guys is there any limitation on computation size or memory in the execution of a function? I am running an iteration and dumping the value of the iterator and breaks early. I tried sending more gas but it ends in the same point . Running through a get reaches further but it cuts due to gas limitations. And putting inside the receive breaks in that point,  and adding more dumps, makes it break even earlier. Also testing that piece of code alone works fine. The problem is when adding it inside of a bigger func.

Guy: Hello everyone, I want to create a contract that receives and sends USDT.

How can I test these functions locally before moving to testnet?

Nikita: Hi everyone! I wondering what is _system in wrapper generated by blueprint? It is used for creating state init data, but I don't understand what is it and why it's needed. Perhaps someone knows where I can read about it?

Illia: Hello there,  Trying to get the same cell hash when generating one with @ton/core and the other one with Cell.hash() Tact's in-built function.  That's my received in Tact.  It dumps number 9418...1544  I'm generating a hash using '.hash()' on a Cell object  But I don't get the same number as the one which is dumped.

Illia: I've just written another code for generating hashes in Python with pytoniq_core and I got the same integer representation of the hash.   It seems like not a Tact's problem so this question is not relevant to this chat, but, if someone has a solution, it will be greatly appreciated.

Laisky: there are a lot of client SDKs (reply to 42969)

Max: The problem is not really in storing balances, but in the ability to liquidate loans when the price changes, given that our parent contract determines the price of the asset. So, when the parent (a uniswap v2-like pool) contract understands that the price reaches a certain point, it may want to liquidate some loans.   The only way I see is offchain tracking with incentives for liquidators (reply to 42970)

Jiego: Absolutely, you would need off chain code to check on prices, check positions and liquidate (reply to 42972)

Max: Right, so that was my question, can it theoretically work fully on chain. We can probably use maps and store a limited number of loans/borrowers (reply to 42973)

Jiego: Something needs to trigger the liquidation. Either the user checking their position or a bot taking a look every few seconds or something like that. Onchain code cannot be triggered by itself (reply to 42974)

Max: When a user executes trade (buy/sell), so the price changes (reply to 42975)

Jiego: so you have a dex on your own? (reply to 42976)

Max: Yes (reply to 42977)

Jiego: ah cool, then is cool, you can check it on each buy/sell. But if the user doesnt sell, how are they gonna be liquidated? (reply to 42978)

Max: Then why would they get liquidated? If they don‚Äôt sell, the price doesn‚Äôt change :) (reply to 42979)
