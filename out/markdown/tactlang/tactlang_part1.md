Dmytro: We have plans that include not only the language, but also many useful tools for developing smart contracts. Tact and the compiler are of course our main goal, but we'll research some other concepts as well.

User<5305381596>: Once it is ready for production use, it could be. At this moment, it's possible to write contracts in it (see Wallet example in the repo) for exploration. Caution should be exercised if you want to try developing a production-grade contract.  Please also be aware that the language will continue evolving to address needs of TON developers most effectively.

Tigr: Okay (reply to 278)

Dmytro: Current version of compiler can produce smartcontract code to the FunC, and then you can deploy it as if you want to deploy FunC code. (reply to 277)

Dmytro: Currently, there are no up-to-date documentation or specification, but we work in this direction, and if nothing is happened, I guess we will release something for reading in the next 1-1.5 monthes. (reply to 279)

Oleg: Hey everyone, a short status update on Tact.  Tact as an improved FunC  Today Tact is a working language that compiles to FunC and offers a number of features that help writing TON contracts with considerably less boilerplate. Big kudos to @cmxog and @p0lunin for pulling this off and getting us to that point.  Tact compiler supports some basic features: control flow and operators, and adds to FunC with nice definitions for structs and enums, automatic de/serialization to/from cells and offers a working model for generic types that lets implementing safe APIs such as checking signed message and extracting its body in one call.  You can check out how Wallet V3 code looks like in Tact right now:  https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/examples/wallet_v3.tact  At this stage Tact still has some oddities and boilerplate that is easy to fix within the current model: e.g. adding mutable slices will let us cleanup annoying "trailing" slices, and we can bake in the serialization compatible with TL-B to remove unnecessary "derive impl (De)serialize" calls. But these are just small polishing tasks that we will put aside for a minute and look at the bigger picture.  The road ahead: from ‚ÄúRust‚Äù to ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù  Let's draw some parallels with popular systems programming languages: C, Rust and Swift.   FunC is, well, "fun C" :-), a thin abstraction over underlying machine with a much nicer syntax than an assembly language.   Current Tact is somewhat similar to Rust: it has a more expressive and safer type system, plus some syntactic affordances, yet delegating a lot of choices to the user and having some annoying internal details sticking out whether you need them or not.  What we want to achieve is a leap-frog language that focuses on the developer experience and makes writing most contracts significantly easier than FunC and the current Tact, thus making development on TON much more accessible to new enthusiasts who join the community today and in the future.   At the risk of making a bad analogy, I will refer to Swift: this is a language that tries to combine two opposites ‚Äî being capable to express the finest details of the program with minimal overhead, while also being instantly friendly to newcomers and making basic programs look as simple as a scripting language.  Intermission  Before we go ahead improving tiny bits of the language that we've got, we are taking a brief pause to review our original goals and design a more concise and powerful syntax. And then improve the compiler towards that goal.  We want to add to the language:  1. Dedicated first-class syntax for message handlers and message interfaces. 2. No-boilerplate serialization compatible with TL-B. 3. Fully automated load/store for the contract state. 4. Gas/value requirements in the interfaces.  We will rewrite common contracts in hypothetical Tact 1.1 and then come back with a concrete roadmap on how we build towards that.

‚Äî 2022-09-06 ‚Äî

Roman: 2. No-boilerplate serialization compatible with TL-B.  It's a good point. I risk looking a little foolish here. Is there any way we could have something like auto-generated abi later?   So we could parse methods and run them using UI in an external software like an online IDE for newcomers using Tact (like RemixIDE analog). (reply to 285)

Oleg: I think view/get methods are the ideal for UI integration because message formats are usually designed for compactness and you may need some "unpacking" to do in the get method to turn some bits into a readable number. And those get methods are for offchain execution anyway (reply to 287)

Oleg: We may also consider similarly offchain "action" methods that would map into SDK directly and perform client-side checks such as "read seqno from the contract state and use it in the message and sign".

Oleg: But that would require extension beyond TVM for sign operations, ignoring gas and making sure we don‚Äôt deploy that code to a blockchain. That's outside the current scope and brings along an unknown amount of complications. (reply to 289)

Steve: Hello, Guys! I am actually started to work on reinstanting TACT compiler and bult it from scratch, i am currently ironing out some corner cases, waiting for FunC compiler fixes, but i was able to compile walet-v4-like contract that even works better (less gas usage) than native implementation.  I am doing it under my own repo: https://github.com/ex3ndr/tact-v2  Comments are greadly appreciated

Kirill: Great!

Kirill: Do you need any help with anything?

Kirill: Like tests / examples or docs?

Steve: i think it would be great to assemble basic documentation about what already implemented

Kirill: in your repo or in general? (reply to 358)

Steve: in general, i am open to move it to ton-community (for example)

Denis: https://github.com/ex3ndr/tact-v2/tree/main/src/examples can you also build jetton.tact.abi?

Steve: it is work in progress (reply to 361)

Steve: I haven't implemented multiple contracts connections right now

Denis: is this abi autogenerated?

Steve: yes

Steve: and ts-wrappers too

Kirill: After a brief chat with Steve, looks like priorities are:  1. Getting a website up 2. Improving docs 3. Addind examples  We need help on getting MVPs of those or creating Footsteps to provide the scope of work for the community to pick up on it

Kirill: @SwiftAdviser does assembling Footsteps for such tasks seem like something you can help with?

Denis: i don't see "wallet-4v-like" contract. only v3-like

Kirill: sounds like a good idea for a Footstep / Issue submission (reply to 369)

Steve: i have implemented only one feature (tx sending) (reply to 369)

Kirill: will you do the honors and create one? (reply to 369)

Steve: I think dicts are just int -> int, not sufficient for plugins

Kirill: @oleganza can I please get admin rights here

Seitaro: Is Jetton example functional or it is WIP for now?

Steve: WIP, i hope to make it work today or tomorrow

Denis: i think wallet v4 is more interesting task. converting hashmap to tuples... what can be more complicated task than jettons (reply to 373)

Steve: i removed tuples since they are slow

Denis: cool. so wallet v4 can't be implemented?

Steve: wat?

Steve: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/4111fd9e3313ec17d99ca9b5b1656445b5b49d8f/func/wallet-v4-code.fc#L186  This is bad code, better to return cell

Steve: since get methods could eat a lot of gas just like was in our nominators

Denis: I agree. But it's already expected by wallets (reply to 382)

Steve: i don't care about backward compatibility, there are no point in doing so anyway

Steve: my version of tact doesn't support externals for now at all since wallets are the only users of such messages and it is always a good idea to authenticate via address instead of key anyway

Roman: Sounds like a good example of how community could help on developing new language. I'll cover tasks with footsteps. (reply to 368)

Steve: i think it is a part of ton-nodejs, i am using abstraction

Narek: Agree, tx-emulator is better for testing contracts, @steve_kite maybe you should switch to emulator? (reply to 399)

shahar: Do we plan to deprecate ton-contract-executor?

Steve: does tx-emulator execute via ton-contract-executor? In general this is not that important since my current implementation can do execution both on blockchain and locally (reply to 401)

Narek: I mean it‚Äôs important for template since you can cover much more test-cases with emulator (reply to 403)

Max: tx-emulator will also at one point have the ability to emulate all the consequences of a sent message in fact this functionality is already available (as an experiment) in the blockchain-experimental branch

Steve: Idk works for me

Howard: then what is this line about? How you got this line of code. (reply to 433)

Steve: I don't understand what you are asking, this is an autogenerated file from tact source

Steve: Are there any chanses that you renamed contract file or created a new one or renamed cotnract name?

Roman: Regarding the tact documentation, I see it like this:  ‚Äî Installation (done) ‚Äî The most simple example of the language ‚Äî Building contract process ‚Äî Deploying contract process ‚Äî List of examples in the repository as text links  + write materials in the "thinking in TON" paradigm:  It is very hard to write contracts for ton IF you are trying to use your experience from other blockchains. And it is quite easy once you got into distributed thinking  What I forgot to add to the first iteration of the tact documentation? Maybe, we should cover some necessary functions/methods? (reply to 358)

Steve: This is a decent summary, it could be expanded to teach about TON concepts during deeper and deeper tutorials

Steve: More like "thinking in TON" since a lot of people coming with solidity in mind and tact intentionally doesn't have much in common

Steve: It is very hard to write contracts for ton IF you are trying to use your experience from eth, but quite easy once you got into distributed thinking

Roman: thank you, it's a good point! I'll think about how to write it (reply to 442)

Kirill: It is very hard to write contracts for ton IF you are trying to use your experience from other blockchains. And it is quite easy once you got into distributed thinking (reply to 443)

talkol: Hi guys, we just see this group now. We were in a different group called ‚ÄúTACT Community‚Äù that was created by @rulon a while ago

talkol: Were not invited here, a bit of a shame

Seitaro: This group was pretty dead for two or three months, until @steve_kite started his own Tact implementation (reply to 468)

Steve: My initial impression of this new compiler was remarkable. I recently tested distributed betting contract. It was so easy to build comparing to nominator's pool that not even distributed. Ability to automatically extract ABI, build interfaces list, clean and a safe way to build contracts is remarkable comparing to func.   I don't see the reason to even try to continue to push func tools for general audience since it is just awful (and reason why we don't have much apps in ton still), compiler have some issues, but they are on par with func level.

Steve: I spent only 30 minutes to build this contract: https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/main/sources/contract.tact

Steve: I just don't like this part: https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/668b9a57d0b91f6e893f2c4b4e17d2265a7052ec/sources/contract.tact#L152  But unaware how to clearly without losing flexibility

Steve: and some quality of life improvements like constants, enums and may be unions, but it is not that interesting

talkol: We don't have anything against TACT, it's a good idea to improve the language, we just want to be involved :)

Steve: I think we urgently need to kill func as language for newcomers, it is very good low level one, but not much above.

shahar: Why compile to func btw and not directly to fift?

Steve: too much risk

Steve: Right now you can still review code that generated and check that everything is fine, fift is impossible to read

doni: fift is impossible

Steve: and i would need to build my own func in practice

shahar: Would generated func be easy to read for complex contracts?

Steve: compiler is quite straight forward

Seitaro: I also want to emphasize that solidity is also compiles to intermediate human-readable language Yul. So it has some sense.

Steve: Yeah, stack-based optimizer is much much easier to do on func level since there are limited types and everything is much lower level. On high level it is unreasonable to do since there are too much magic involved

Steve: like.. there are no concept of a stack at all in my code, rolling out this would be just reinventing func

Howard: that is helpful (reply to 471)

Howard: awesome @steve_kite, but I got issued when I get the initial deploy code like here (reply to 473)

Howard: then the problem will be: the browser can't read the URL long like this. I sent the testTON to through this URL, and it failled.

Steve: Yeah, i usually copy it to mac notes app and sync it to an iphone and then click a link

Steve: I think eventually i will finalize tonblack.com and give a simple way to perform transactions via any available wallet

Howard: lmao I tried to changed it to ton:// seems still can't work properly. But your suggestion is good. (reply to 493)

kalloc: hm do you have vim syntax for tact ?

kalloc: or tree-sitter ?

Steve: no, but looking for someone to contribute

Steve: very painful right now

kalloc: i can port vscode syntax to tree-sitter

kalloc: ouch, don't you have vscode extension?

Steve: no

Howard: Correct we if I am wrong: You can still deploy the code even the smart contract having the bug, right?

Howard: because yarn deploy didn't check any functional for the Tact code itself.

Steve: you can write tests to test everything

Howard: Because I thought at least it should be get error message if code is not completed.   like Remix here.

Steve: deploy uses the one you built before

Steve: so you need first to build it, yarn build, and then deploy

Steve: it is done this way to be able to commit changes and always new what you are going to deploy

Howard: oh, understood

Steve: HOPEFULLY ledger would be tomorrow

Vitaly: Is there like a post or something to explain what's the current status of tact?  I gather it's functional on some level but everything is a bit confusing (reply to 513)

Steve: It is working, but uses experimental standards that are not yet to be finalized. I would recommend to use it if you are not planning to launch something VERY big in a month.

Steve: There are no docs, though, only examples.

Howard: you sure it works? haha (reply to 493)

Steve: try to wrap init in this function function toUrlSafe(src: string) {     while (src.indexOf('/') >= 0) {         src = src.replace('/', '_');     }     while (src.indexOf('+') >= 0) {         src = src.replace('+', '-');     }     while (src.indexOf('=') >= 0) {         src = src.replace('=', '');     }     return src; }

Steve: i think my template doesn't use base64 in url-safe mode

Howard: what is the test-net ID on workchain parameter?

Steve: Ton have multiple chains, you should use only 0 one

doni: great news ! (reply to 513)

doni: is there a jetton implementation in tact yet ?

Howard: so the`message` in .tact is more like Event in solidity, right?

Howard: is a way that help us can track on-chain data for the smart contract behavior

Oleg: no, the messages in Tact are the TON messages: things that contracts (actors) communicate with (reply to 524)

Andrew: *replaceAll (reply to 518)

Steve: replaceAll not avaliable in all environments

Mr. John: value   .replace(/+/g, '-')   .replace(/\//g, '_')   .replace(/=/g, '')

Dan: –∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∏—Ü–∞?

Mr. John: –∫–æ—Ä–æ—á–µ

Steve: Added more docs about TACT: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/docs/overview.md

‚Äî 2022-12-22 ‚Äî

Steve: Just released new version: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.3.0  A lot of fixes and deep strings support!

Dan: Great! Strings look like a game changer üòÖ (reply to 534)

Howard: I just deployed a contract on testnet! (It's so cool that I can deploy through TonKeeper, awesome experience!)  But I got this error that exit code 130 on explorer, is there any Explorer I can test the contract or interacting with it directly? https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/kQA54BekYjFpmVa4AMD6cB2Eu_GYD9KATiQgrxeMXmci_KPj

Howard: nice niec (reply to 534)

Howard: can you explain more on Context means in Tact? I can't find on document for this yet.   And seems this is a default syntax that we can use? Like address(this) in Solidity? (reply to 473)

Howard: For example, I am trying to build a Vault contract which can store every deposit record. Like the code below:  Since the receive method can't put like this firstly? üòÖüòÖ   *I am thinking the way like  emit UploadRecord(msg.sender, _amount, _code);  in Solidity.

Howard: ummm, need to know how to set ERROR code. Otherwise it's hard to know why the tx fallback.  https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQAzdTWkHL3eFDGDnJPMx8DngVwfRyWID76TYp8rknv24C5M

Steve: I am working on error codes, description is in Abi currently

Howard: oh?

Howard: maybe I asked with a misleading way.

Howard: What is the simpleReply means here in your TonBet contract?  https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/668b9a57d0b91f6e893f2c4b4e17d2265a7052ec/sources/contract.tact#L204   Can't properly find why 64 here, and use 128 in other place.

Steve: 64 sends all remaining value of an incoming message

Steve: 128 sends all remaining balance of a contract

Steve: There are no events in TON right now and they work different here (reply to 540)

Howard: oh I think I understand how message works.

Howard: Would love to try out Struct and and mapping right now in tact

Steve: Struct almost the same though

Howard: OK, then that was bad because I can't find out why the transaction failed even though I test it before. Maybe can adding the comment message in require like: require( valueA > valueB, "tx failed because valueB is bigger than valueA"); (reply to 549)

Steve: Yes I will generate error codes from error messages but explorer won‚Äôt show you the message, it is available only knowing abi and explorers doesn‚Äôt support it yet

Howard: I will say the customized message in TON is super cool.   More like I can specifically asked what Smart Contract should do. Compared with Solidity, this is more flexible to scale the usage of the functions, right?

Steve: Yes, they all also async

Howard: Oh, ok. Thanks! Would like to see more example codes from you!  With the usage of mapping and customized struct.  Thinking how fast or convenient it is in TON blockchain. If I want to store the data on-chain in TON. Let's say a dataset for a school, is it ok to store those data on-chain?  You know, in EVM it's so expensive to store the data like this on-chain.

Steve: Ton is scalable, you can store it yes but not in a single contract, but in many separate one

Steve: Just like multisig contract stores all pending transactions in separate contract

Steve: Or tonbet stores bet value in BetHolder

Un gars bien: would love to see them too üòµ still lost in FunC documentation on dicts (reply to 551)

Howard: Got an error here when set the Struct

Steve: Update the compiler

Howard: Seems I am struggling in using Struct in practice now

Steve: You need to construct it via {‚Ä¶}

shahar: is it up to the contract owner to upload and pin the abi-ipfs artifact?

Steve: yes

Steve: i will provide an opt-in (out?) service to upload abi

Steve: i personally want to have compiler completely offline i often work on planesüëÄ

shahar: definitely. I think that publishing the proof is a different step

shahar: we have the https://tonverifier.live service that can handle that

shahar: the architecture is a bit different, where there‚Äôs a proof-contract for each code cell hash, and there‚Äôs a main sources registry that‚Äôs queried for the child contract addresses.

Steve: verify source?

Steve: i want to provide ipfs link to sources too, you would be able to scan contracts on the network and capture all sources and verify them automatically

shahar: yes, it allows different parties to register as verifiers that ensure that the provided source compiles to the same hash as onchain.

shahar: the proof-contracts provide the ipfs link to the sources (reply to 579)

Steve: Also it would be possible to perform re-verification in browser

shahar: also the proof contracts are upgradeable, so that you won‚Äôt need to redeploy them when upgrading from ipfs to ton-storage

Steve: actually i don't see the need for verifiers as it is since you can always recompile in browser itself

Steve: just simple web app that displays and verifies source on client

shahar: it minimizes the probabilty of a source being fake.  in the approach where the contract declares on the sources itself, there‚Äôs no other authority to verify that when publishing the ipfs link, which obviously can be forged.  so yes, the contracts can be re-verified, but would we want explorers displaying the source code and encouraging all users to re-verify all the time?  with verifiers, there‚Äôs a gatekeeper. that gatekeeper would need to be compromised in order to publish a fake proof.

shahar: so you get: - a good (though not perfect) level of trust, - pinning out of the box, - upgrade path to ton storage - some deduplication due to it relying on code cell hash instead of being per contract

Steve: üöÄ Minor release 0.4.0  https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.4.0

Howard: If you got this error said Module '"ton"' has no exported member 'readString'.ts  Remember to run yarn add ton (reply to 588)

Steve: update it to the latest version too

Howard: The expected type comes from property 'initialData' which is declared here on type '{ workchain: number; initialCode: Cell; initialData: Cell; }'   Have you got this error on the origin deploy scripts?

Steve: i usually enforce to a single version by adding this to package.json    "resolutions": {     "ton": "12.3.2"   },

Howard: Yes, I had. Because I am using the template. (reply to 592)

Howard: But there is no error since I just remove the import for 'readString' and 'StringToCell'. All good now. (reply to 589)

Howard: Understood. If I want to trigger the receive method with Name<>Address and Score<>Int as input, I need to encode these values as a code and combine them in the URL.   This will allow TonKeeper to send the correct information to the contract.   We cannot just put these informations in the comment area directly if we want to transfer the funds to other address let's say.

Howard: How you guys put the input String(the text want to send to smartContract) coded to type Cell or any else? (reply to 529)

Howard: like this line of code in test, I just want to trigged the receive method and passed the ValueA / ValueB through TonKeeper.   I have to encoded the input value in TypeScript first right?

Steve: it encodes everything for you, just pass string

Steve: and tonkeeper would encode it by itself

Howard: ummm then how I pass string like this receive(msg: Join2) in comment area?  It's "Join2, my-address, 10" ?

Steve: no, this is have to be encoded to cell and send just like during deploy

Steve: deploy in ton is the same as just sending a message

Howard: I see. I can find the encode modules in the output folder that inside the xxxx.ts (reply to 601)

Howard: just like here packAdd is the method which is executable from this smart contract.

Steve: yes, all types have this encodings inside of generated bindings

Andrey: @steve_kite where i can see grammar for new tact? I wanna implement support to intellij after NY

Steve: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/src/grammar/grammar.ohm

Andrey: ty ü¶ù (reply to 607)

Steve: I recommend not to use it as is since it is tailloared for compilation

Andrey: although the syntax is very similar to BNF for Intellij, I will still make edits to it to interact with the internal API, so don't worry. This is exactly what I need (reply to 609)

Andrey: I've been running my eyes quickly right now and the syntax is very cool, very kotlinish, just like I love it. Very good job, @steve_kite üòç

Now create your own jetton contract very easy: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/src/examples/jetton.tact  stdlib implementation details: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/wallet.tact https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/master.tact https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/stdlib/libs/jetton/messages.tact  It would be useful if someone review this and check that this indeed works. Do we have tools to check jettons on testnet?

Steve: It turns if you rewrite jettons to TACT, standard would make sense

Seitaro: What a surprise! There are toncli tests for jettons in toncli main repo and I believe there ton-contract-executor tests there as well. Should be a good start (reply to 616)

Howard: Just deploy to test net then send tx each by each? (reply to 615)

Howard: is it possible to import directly by putting these .tact in the same place? (reply to 615)

Howard: Try to compile but got this error, even tho I put these file in the same place.

Howard: just trying to understand the new type StateInit, is it a data type that you import from library "@stdlib/ownable"? Can't find in any place on tact-template.  I know it's a method that when you want to create a new contract, you will need initialized the code for it.   But where is this type word came from?

Howard: Same as the syntax here I got from TonBet files:  1) Why we need nativeReserve to keep more spaces for storage? And where is this words coming from?  2) Why SimpleSend function (in below) need to keep extract plus 2 with 128? Also because of TVM design that we need keep the extract space for storage?   üßê Please bear with the questions I asked here. I am just intensively learning tact. (reply to 473)

Howard: Hi, I am playing with mapping now on Tact. The structure I set is quite simple as pic1, and pic2 shows the mapping data I got when I read from contract.  Question: How can I turn the address data in the mapping, turn back to the readable address format?

Howard: like in TypeScript library, we turn address to executor here. But how to reverse it back to 36bytes?

Howard: What is the default Bool value in Tact. I got failed with ExitCode 7....change a bit but still can't find the solution.  I am thinking that for the require statement, it is not correct. Because the if the address never store in the mapping, it will get Null.

Howard: Oh, yes. It's null. I found answer here:  https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/examples/increment.tact (reply to 634)

Vitaly: >https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/src/examples/jetton.tact seems to unavailable 404 (reply to 615)

Howard: is there any time limitation I can add in Tact, like timestamp + 3 days in solidity.

Howard: How to implement the data into the struct I design in a map I have called myMap: map[Address]myStruct

Howard: MemberInfo is the struct I define in the firstüôàüòÇ

Steve: TACT Compiler release v0.5.0 - Constants - Jettons example and library - require now accepts string as second parameter - Optional address is now serialized using native representation, not tact-one  https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.5.0 (forwarded from TON Development News)

Steve: btw, subscribe to this channel, it always meant to be a independent source of all dev tools news. if you have something to post, please share with me, let's improve this group

Steve: One of the nicest things is that TACT now generates ids for errors and require method now accepts a string and put mappings into ABI.

doni: I have a question regarding the jetton impl.   I see that its not the same interface ( opcodes are different bc of the hash256(‚Äúmint‚Äù) convention ) right ?

Steve: mint is not part of the standard i think

doni: I agree its not on TEP 74 ,  but its part of the source code https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/op-codes.fc

Steve: idk, op = 21 is a weird choise

doni: I agree =) not a crc of anything

doni: I tried to test it with tests and tools that already exsits

Steve: did it work?

doni: I will play with it

doni: well mint doesnt work

doni: i will by pass that

Steve: well, mint is not part so it is custom

Steve: if you want i think you can do the same message with such opcode

Steve: but tact right now requires to have at least one field so if it doesn't have fields it won't work

doni: Im trying to understand everything thorugh the source code ‚Ä¶ Im getting there step by step

doni: not sure why the double op for every action ‚Ä¶ I will understand eventually just started

doni: double op ( comment and Int)

Steve: what do you mean?

doni: ;; Text Receivers     if (op == 0) {         var text_op = slice_hash(in_msg);                  ;; Receive "Mint!" message         if (text_op == 0xcd0d986cb1a2f468ae7089f4fc3162c116e5f53fbd11a6839f52dbf5040830b2) { and     ;; Receive Mint message     if (op == 2737462367) {

Steve: it is a different messages

doni: one is binary for mint message   and the 2nd ?

Steve: second is for text message

doni: I understand  ok but its the same aciton diffrenet apis ,  binary messages  and comment based messages

Steve: yes

Steve: one requires some code, another could be used with any wallet right out of the box

Steve: also text could be confirmed on ledger

Steve: I actually thinking about expanding text parsing capabilities, it would be better for ledger

doni: ok that would be great to see comments on the ledeger screen

doni: instead of HEX

Steve: what do you mean?

Steve: ofc it has it

Steve: i send all transactions with text comments and confirm messages on the screen

doni: Yes that great !

doni: great expierence

Steve: ah i got what you mean, yes text is better

Steve: i am thinking about how to send schema to ledger but i am not able to figure out the best way to do so

doni: what is paractice for sperators ?   Action!arg1,arg2,  etc ?

Steve: it is not supported yet

‚Äî 2022-12-24 ‚Äî

Howard: got error when compile, I already update to v0.5.0 then. TypeError: (0 , ton_1.stringToCell) is not a function

Howard: ummm even back to ton-tact@0.3.0 still got this error. So it's not the .tact file issued.

Howard: Fixed. Do not use ton@12.2.8 üòÇ

Howard: what is the Cell data type looks like in TVM on Tact? Haven't have any idea that how to input the message into it.

Howard: Good to know: 1/ Can't use Builder or Slice data type on Tact. 2/ You can claim dataType with question mark that enable the data could be null. For example, if you claim one of data set in Struct with "Int?" then it could be Int or the Null. (reply to 691)

Howard: I just declared a mapping with a struct in my code, and set the data into it!   All the transactions ran successfully when I wrote the data into the chain.  But when I read the contract message, I got this kind of data set. As you can see, it should be based on a key input that is an Int. I get null when I input a key that is not an Int.  So when I printed all the mapping data, I got this.   My question is, how can we read the mapping data from the smart contract successfully? Because I need to transform/decode the bits into an Int or?

‚Äî 2022-12-25 ‚Äî

Howard: It's in BOC, you need to know the TL-B schema of the data. Then you can use any Slice implementation to read the data according to the schema. (forwarded from Slava Fomin)

Howard: How do I find my SmartContract TL-B schema to help me decoded the data I fetched from my on-chain data?

Howard: anyone know that?

Howard: maybe we need an unpack script as well in output folder once we run yarn build successfully?

Howard: Like the template here, once we deploy the contract, we will using the packAdd function from the folder.  https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template/blob/0488a8e7f333a49e34ff8762223bc27f818869ad/sources/contract.deploy.ts#L2  cc@steve_kite

Howard: is there any way we can test contract with more caller accounts?   I know we can write test case on contract.spec.ts file, but that is not enough for me to test my contract

Howard: I wrote a 250 lines of code in practice, and got this error once I want to deploy.   (Yes, it can compile successfully. And the input argument is correct)

Howard: Out of my knowledge, definitely need Steve to trouble shooting ü•∂üòì the exitCode seems not the same means in _errors area in your ts file after you compile the contract code.

Alex: Hello, guys! I want to get into the creating of detailed documentation of the TACT language. This first footstep describes my vision of this work, based on what you mentioned earlier. I ask involved people to consider the proposed plan and add comments if you have any thoughts how to improve it.

Howard: it shouldn't be the Contract Code error right? Or the abi issued. Seems the encoded typeScript file show the error when I get the bin/Boc data when I try to genera a URL to deploy the code. (reply to 706)

‚Äî 2022-12-26 ‚Äî

Howard: I found the issued!!!   Because I claim a parameters and did not claim and value in default!! (like self.key = value; in init part) (reply to 705)

Seitaro: it is not part of standard and it is ok to use other op (reply to 650)

Howard: Tact and TON is super cool!

Howard: is there any example for return value that I temporally had in a if loop?

Howard: Like here, return the Value A.   Although it is claim in a if Loop. ‚úÖ

Howard: or maybe I should using fun xyz() that manipulate the value in the function.

Howard: But in ton-bet example, we are using 3 parameters?

Howard: Same issue: If you deploy a contract that can trigger the deployment of a new contract, you need to ensure that the initial parameters you specify have default values. In Rust, you must provide a default value for any Int or Address you set previously.  This is why we got Exit Code: 7 (reply to 718)

datboi: hi there! how did you enable syntax highlight in VS? (reply to 453)

Howard: I put it as Rust lang. Let's all.

‚Äî 2022-12-27 ‚Äî

Howard: in Jetton Wallet standard: We have     let fwdFee: Int = ctx.readForwardFee();    What is .readForwardFee means? This is the "Gas Fee" of the Tx sent to the current contract, I guess?

Steve: No, it is much more complicated that this. Better to take a look at whitepapers first

Howard: Thanks. Is it called with other name?

Steve: Yes

Howard: I can't implement the String to the .tact.   1) Already update to ^0.5.0; 2) Even I copy the example payout.tact in my local folder then compile still got the error.

Steve: upgrade ton library to latest and don't forget to update resolve field in package.json

Howard: OKOK

Howard: Seems the executor issued.

Howard: what version should I add in resolve field in package.json? (reply to 730)

Steve: that's why we are enforcing versions in package.json

Steve: i spent few last days to reimplement everything in a new library that would work without such issues

Howard: Nice nice!!!!

Howard: Tips: Noticed that you were not putting the same address in the mapping multiple time!  Although you can still compile the code to get the deploy URL and then send the transaction, you will not be able to activate this contract if you write it like this in the mapping! (For example, the mapData2 in the screenshot.)

Steve: Missing type check?

Steve: please, file this in github?

Howard: For those non-activate contract will be like this on https://testnet.dton.io/

Howard: for the receive() method, is it able to receive Integer as a input?   I am thinking that how I can set series of functions once user send numbers, like '1, 2, 3, 4.....`  If receive integer number 1, I store his address. if else receive the integer number 2, I store his TON balance..during the moment.

Steve: only by wrapping into a message

Howard: yeh, understood. But I am thinking how I can integrate with @cryptoBot based on the comment feature when sending Tx. I want People can trigge Tx without wrapping the message.

Howard: Then that would be super super cool and easily get mass adoption.

Steve: You can try to parse slices

Steve: like receive a String, make it ".asSlice" and then read it byte by byte

Howard: Slices? Can you share a gist for example?

Howard: ohhhh probably got your point. Let me try out.   Is .asSlice method already integrate in Tact @^0.5.0?

Steve: yes

Howard: So write a receive method that can accept all the Strung Input? How to do so? (reply to 748)

Steve: receive(msg: String) { }

Howard: like this?

Steve: no, you have to parse numbers

Howard: can't find .loadCoins() in https://github.com/ton-community/tact by the way.   What is that means in detail?

Howard: ummm seems close the answer. But still got  ExitCode '9': `Cell underflow `

Howard: Have you try out how to turn the String to the BigInt before? @iftryalexg

Howard: @name(load_uint) extends mutates native loadUint(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;  @name(preload_uint) extends native preloadUint(self: Slice, l: Int): Int;   What is load / preload means? ü§£

Andrey: Load changes position of slice, preload - not (reply to 767)

Howard: üòµ‚Äçüí´

Howard: still shows Exit9 if I  send a String type of number

Andrey: As you can see load has modificator "mutable", it's changes state of Slice with new position (reply to 767)

Howard: make sense. Then how I should prepare for the bytes space if the input is the Numbers with "String type".  (because it's on comment only)

Howard: Oh! I got the solutions, maybe the space of Slice is different every time!  The best situation is record the size of Slice for this input String!  Aka, check the size of the Builder(the size of the Slice we got from Input)

datboi: will this contract accept my external message? or is it possible to transfer coins only by internal message with TransferMessage structure?  https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/examples/wallet.tact

datboi: is it possible to define a method like recv_external in func?

Steve: Not yet, but I recommend to use internal instead

datboi: will it be implemented?

Steve: What‚Äôs the use case?

Andrey: ponimayu

Steve: Bounced flag doesn‚Äôt make sense here btw

datboi: basic wallet contract, for example. if i use wallet, it‚Äôs possible that i dont have any other contract, from which i can send internal message (reply to 778)

Steve: You better avoid doing this

Steve: External messages require to have completely different flow and work with gas, it is better to avoid and just use internal messages

Steve: New low level wallet contracts not needed in general

datboi: ok, got it

datboi: this function just creates local variable and nothing else, am i right?  receive("duplicate") {     // Create new wallet     let walletInit: StateInit = initOf Wallet(self.key, self.walletId + 1); } (reply to 774)

Howard: @CryptoBot can't support withdraw to the contract address yet. (reply to 773)

datboi: does tact have jetton example? the contract below at least doesn‚Äôt have transfer methods üôÇ  https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/examples/jetton.tact

Howard: noticed that an error will happen if I create to many mapping initially....

Howard: Tips: you can only set 8 mapping in one contract!!  Remember this then can save you lots of time!  Solution: Clean up the data structure, or create a new contract to store the data I guess.

Howard: wondering how we can send fallback comment once people accidentally sent the money to the contract?

doni: I think it would be very interesting for you to study the jetton and nft architecture and understand how to shard data between multiple contracts  mapping / dictionaries have many cons due to the memory layout of ton ( everything is a bag of cells ) (reply to 790)

doni: https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons

Howard: nice! nice!

Steve: This is temprorary limitation, I did t aware that someone would hit it (reply to 789)

Howard: One more question is that, how we get 'the current moment of "ctx.value" '  For example, the Tx will trigged a receive method in my contract that will generate a new contract.  But during the excecution, it's hard to get the rest of value that "after the gas used". Is there any any way to get so?

Steve: No

Howard: URI Too Large

‚Äî 2022-12-28 ‚Äî

Howard: OK, same mistake.   If you get Exit Code 7 all the time since your ContractA will initialized a ContractB. It might be happend because you didn't set a default value for the dataType you claimed firstly!!  (Took hours to find the bug üò≠ (reply to 720)

Howard: is there any functions that can count in BlockNumbers or Local Time? (Like 1 hour, 1 day...so on)  For example, would like to set a functions that will fallback the funds to original senders since after 24hrs.

Howard: Like, I can create a bounty by deposit some TONs, and since no one submit the Tx, then the funds will back to myself after 24 hours.

Howard: Any example for NFT in Tact yet? (reply to 792)

Howard: btw, there is no Non-fungible Token Standard yet, right?

Seitaro: TON's repository with standards is here (reply to 807)

Howard: I can't understand FunC ü•∫

Howard: but will try out build a trait

Howard: On the other hand, I am building a DApp using self.counter: Int as the MemberID to tag for the users.   One question is that, is this might be something issued happend there?

Howard: Tagging the users using the contract status, is that ok in Tact?   (For example, once the receive(Register) complete, then add 1 in self.counter)

Howard: Would like to see what is the example in Tact for rollback action

Howard: ok, builders never stop. Will try out implement a NFT version in Tact.

Howard: what is the recv_internal means in Tact?   Like init() {}, right?

Howard: hi all, what is the op == op::get_royalty_params()?   Which means the type of message send to smart Contract with method called get_royalty_params? (forwarded from Howard)

Howard: this method is "External message" right?

Howard: I think TACT haven't have the global syntax for this yet?

Lev: There's just a function defined somewhere called op::get_royalty_params() that returns an int with the op-code of the operation, no special syntax involved (reply to 816)

Howard: okok!

Steve: You can‚Äôt parse manually in TACT this code is generated and value of op is a part of message definition

Howard: There is also has input for get Method in NFT, what is the individual_nft_content means?

Howard: okok üòÇ

Howard: ok, would like to know how I can pick up a "random number" in Tact to set as query_id like we had in standards (reply to 808)

Alex: It seems math.tact permanently included and you can use one of (randomize_lt(), randomize()), don't you? (reply to 825)

Howard: This is super cool! But are the differences for those two? (reply to 826)

Howard: Can't code in FunC yet. But appreciate it! (reply to 828)

Howard: hi @steve_kite , I jus reached a error said "Max Call Stack Size" when compiling. What should I do next?

Howard: Never mind, seems some empty setting for  receive(),  receive(msg: String) bounced() will crashed the compiler. Just skip these part.

Howard: tried to follow the dataStructure & input that the standard asked.   Can we set a  'Get' function to get the MethodCode of the contract? (reply to 808)

Howard: got this error when I tried to import Math.tact   import "@stdlib/math"; (reply to 826)

Alex: it is part of stdlib, you needn‚Äôt include it, I think. For me build works properly w/o additional import:  contract Lottery with OwnableTransferable {     owner: Address;     rand: Int as uint256;      init(owner: Address) {         self.owner = owner;         self.rand = random();     } } (reply to 835)

Howard: think that the difference for  random() and randomize(x: Int) (reply to 836)

Steve: do you have a test file? (reply to 832)

Steve: do not use random generator in init functions (reply to 836)

Alex: As I understand you need contract Collection.  I saw example, where Contract uses Trait, but you are trying in Trait using Trait. What for? (reply to 840)

Steve: Traits within traits are supported

Steve: I suppose there are no imports provided

Howard: Do we get passed for this jetton Standard on Tact already?   Some part of the code doens't maket sense for me when I compared with TEP074 (reply to 615)

Steve: Like what?

Steve: I tested jettons briefly, it worked

Howard: why here is double '!'https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/0e0d8088809d82e2bffce553cb6b2c92887ad5bc/stdlib/libs/jetton/wallet.tact#L98  I can't compile the code....

Steve: This forces variable to be not null

Howard: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md   And as this TEP mentioned, I guess I should set Int? as Bool data type?

Howard: Yeh, it doesn't work with me. Quite weird. (reply to 852)

Steve: You prev_owner is not nullable

‚Äî 2022-12-30 ‚Äî

Howard: maybe just typo: But the response_destination in TEP-0074 didn't be use in JettonStandard.tact (reply to 849)

Howard: Hi all, how can we unpacked the data from on-chain?

Howard: I followed the TEP0074 to set this get function in Tact.

Howard: The problem is the the data return from this function is an Object

Herm√®s: Maybe you can set the function with the store value you want first? (reply to 862)

Remy ü•û: Hey üëã guys

‚Äî 2022-12-31 ‚Äî

Howard: Hi, guys. I am test it out with Forward Fee, and it always failed because the ctx.value(aka the TON I sent) is lower than the value I got.   My question is why the value I got at ctx.readForwardFee are so high?

Steve: what do you mean high?

Howard: This line of code is followed TEP64 here, right?

Howard: I am confusing with forward_ton_amount and fwd_fee I guess.   To be clear, fwd_fee is the fee that we paid during the execution.   And forward_ton_amount or forward_amount in TEP62 is the nano-ton that we move to token contract itself to paid with the future storage cost, is that correct?

Steve: forward_ton_amount is the amount to attach to a message of a sent token

Steve: you usually need some ton in the message to make receiving part to execute code (this is how it paid for transactions)

Howard: That is more like Account Abstraction I guess in EVM?  Then next question is, when the ton balance of JettonWallet Contract(let's say) going to zero, we need to transfer the TON to contract to maintain it can receive the Tx and execute the code as well?

Steve: no, by default tx fees are paid from value of incoming messages

Howard: Then I think I found a place might not followed TEP74-Jetton, correct me if I am wrong:  the Jetton standard in this line under the fun mint(), it trigged the initial TransferInternal for the first Tx.   The forward_amount should not put as zero as TEP said. (reply to 873)

Steve: yes, because notification doesn't make sence to send with zero value

Steve: since it wouldn't be processed

Howard: I just deployed the NFT standard in TEP62 successfully.   But now the issued is that even I passed the Txs with right method code. The testnet.getgems.io still can't fetch my NFT data success.   (aka, the get method for 'get_nft_data')   1/ I can called and get my nft contract data back successfully.   2/ Some people asked that I should change the Get Function name to exactly same in get_nft_data. But I don't think it would work.

Howard: üëæ üòÇ

Howard: it must be kidding me.... it passed if I changed my local tact file function to exactly same name.....   thanks get_nft_data....

Howard: I thought the name is no different for the result tho

Alex: Does anybody know, if I can invoke a test for a function declared inside the contract(like fun doMagic)? Failed in my experiments and can‚Äôt find similar case in the examples.   contract Sample {  //contract body     fun doMagic() {     // Magic     } }

Steve: self.doMagic()

Howard: Hi I jus tried to implement the TEP62 of NFT standard in Tact. You can deploy then send the 'Mint' in string to get NFT.  You should implement UpdateContent or Update Royalty Parameters if you want listing on getgems!  https://github.com/howardpen9/tact-template-nft/tree/main/sources

Dan: Great job! (reply to 888)

Howard: I followed most of the steps as reference in @steve_kite 's Jetton code. Because of those template that I can easily learn how to code in Tact! (reply to 889)

‚Äî 2023-01-01 ‚Äî

Howard: hi, how to put "String" into Cell data type in Tact libraries? I am checking with getgems NFT libraries.   I think what we need in Tact ecosystem is different. For example, when we deploy the contract with the initial content, we don't have "String" data type to put for NFT content(aka, the URL, the metadata, the string).  We only accept with Cell data type.

Howard: I think can optimized this part for Tact developer more easy to deploy the contract so on so for.

Alex: Hey, hny. As I saw from source(also added short description here), it should work in this way: StringBuilder s = beginString(); s.append("String"); Cell data = s.toCell();  or  in short form, perhaps Cell data = beginString().append("String").toCell();  But need to check how Tact compiler(also, I'm not sure about boundaries for String length). As you really f&f I think you can try it right now. :) (reply to 891)

Howard: I also tried this way, because you know, in NFT standard we need passed the Royalties Parameters and the URL. (reply to 893)

Howard: Thanks a lot!   Let me try out this method and then change my Tact code. (reply to 893)

Howard: do you have the way for TypeScript? Because those initial input can only send the string in Cell, right? (reply to 893)

Howard: I tried to sent this URL in collection_content for different ways, still failed  https://testnet.explorer.tonnft.tools/collection/EQA4P3-7QwrqjE3P87XDWrW1umKK2vy6g3ILR51sxyhXPxJZ

Howard: I guess I had issued when put this URL content to the Cell when I trying to deploy the contract

Alex: Well, I'm not sure what way will better for you. Perhaps @truecarry or @dvlkv could advice the best way. I looked through examples and It seems most relevant of them. You can check examples for NFT-deployers here. But example for "ton" library should exist too, i think. (reply to 898)

Howard: Then I think implement wrong in get_nft_content(int index, cell individual_content)

Howard: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md   the full_content in down below is the same as the collection_content previously, right?   It made the confusion üòÇ

Seitaro: No, collection and each NFT of collection have it's own independent content. However content of the NFT is not stored in it's contract but distributed between NFT and Collection. To get finalised NFT content you need to get individual_content from NFT contract and process it via collection's get_nft_content method. Such separation allows to build flexible systems, for instance - collection can contain shared part of content of all items - update of collection contract allows to update all NFT's content simultaneously by updating get_nft_content function (otherwise it would be necessary to update each NFT separately) (reply to 901)

Howard: To get finalized of NFT Item content, I need process item contract's get function get_nft_data() get the individual_content, and then passed to get_nft_content() get function on collection data to get the full content data (aka, the url?   Let's take the example cases here again, in testnet-nft tool website we got the content for this collection for each:  Then I will store these URL separately in content? Got it.

Seitaro: >To get finalized of NFT Item content, I need process item contract's get function get_nft_data() get the individual_content, and then passed to get_nft_content() get function on collection data to get the full content data Yes  Note, however, that NFT content is not always url, content/metadata is also may be stored onchain (reply to 903)

Howard: https://github.com/getgems-io/nft-contracts/blob/main/packages/contracts/nft-collection/NftCollection.data.ts#L12 (forwarded from Howard)

Howard: This is the example in FunC that people will passed in when create an NFT collections.

‚Äî 2023-01-02 ‚Äî

Howard: can we have more example in, how to use .asSlice()? .fromBase64()? (reply to 748)

Howard: I think I am struggle with put Slice to String lmao.

Howard: Cell into Slice data type, then put Slice into StringBuilder, then put StringBuilder to String Output ? üëæüòÇ

Howard: It is failed.   I checked with src/test/features/strings.tact in Tact repo, there is no direct way to put Cell to String.   (aka, for NFT content, will need concat 2 string which store in Cell type in Smart Contract)  Any suggestion?

Howard: Hi, I followed the document that put the cell data I store in contract put as 'StringBuilder'.   But since I append the String, got this error.   ` cannot unify type tuple with slice       tuple $content_toSlice = __gen_Cell_asSlice($content_cell);`

Howard: cc @steve_kite can you take a look please? I am stuck in here a whileüòµ‚Äçüí´

Howard: Hi, before I figured out the Tact compile issue. I draw this graph to clarify the process of setting the NFT standard in Tact.  Followed the TEP62.   And I have the question about 'query_id'. Let's say we implement the initial mint of NFT item based on this, (follow the example, this kind of Tx query_id is set for 0)

Howard: My question is: If I want to implement more functionality, should we let the user(pass on message format with 'query_id').   Or we just set a random query_id in smart contract code level?  (For the red line as the example that I want to add in my NFT contract)

Howard: anyone has the same issued? when dealing with Cell to String something like that (reply to 912)

Steve: query id is arbitrary number that could be used in contracts

Steve: I am not aware if anyone actually used it now

Howard: thanks thanks

Howard: can't understand why got this error thoü•πü§©

Howard: does simpleSend or simpleReply not works in stdlib?

Alex: Where are from these functions? I can't find them in send.tact. (reply to 921)

Howard: I followed it from TonBet repo.

Howard: https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/668b9a57d0b91f6e893f2c4b4e17d2265a7052ec/sources/contract.tact#L52

Alex: Declared as special case of send in this contract here. (reply to 924)

Howard: thanks, make sense. I can implement it in contract myself.

Howard: Btw, anyone got this error when trying to put cell to string? (reply to 912)

Howard: still trying to implement a version for NFT standard in Tact

Alex: I had same issue when tried append() (reply to 927)

Howard: I just got this weird error that I can't find where if I had this get function....

Howard: This function is basically a easy math calculation thoüò≥ü§™

Howard: but if I comment the require line of code, then wouldn't had the error when compile... quite wired. Wouldn't have error before tho.

Steve: incorrect library versions

Howard: ok, I think it is happend when too many different string in require() statement

Howard: oh? what is that mean (reply to 936)

Howard: I am using ton in "12.2.8". and ^0.5.0 for Tact

Howard: Yeh, I think the error is coming from require statement

‚Äî 2023-01-03 ‚Äî

Howard: Sorry, which one is incorrect? (reply to 936)

Alex: @steve_kite  I noticed fromInit() function in tests, and I can't launch successfully yarn test in jetton project. Is it something in progress? Or could You provide, what I should double check to achieve a successful launch of these tests?

Howard: since compile completed, got this kind of error that I can't find the solution myself.    Property '#private' in type 'BitString' refers to a different member that cannot be accessed from within type 'BitString'  BitString? I didn't interactive with String tho.

Howard: OK, fix when I deleted the resolution changed in package.json (reply to 944)

User<2130735915>: Good (reply to 947)

Steve: I just released TACT 0.6.0, no language changes, but it works with a new ton.js libraries and uses completely different way to test your contracts using new ton-emulator:  I recommend to checkout new template and copy your sources: https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template

Steve: I need a feedback of testing: https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template/blob/main/sources/contract.spec.ts  With a new api you are not testing contract as is, but in the whole system and things became a little bit different and little bit more complicated, but i hope it is still straightforward

Steve: BTW bindings now can work with v2 and v4 API as well as emulator using the same syntax!

Steve: Also, i am really looking into a list of a bugs, but i need them ready to test, usually just ready to build source helps

Steve: Sorry i was really busy solving all this legacy stuff in ton.js library and whole ecosystem

Steve: üåö

Steve: In general, i think we are 60% into production ready release. The things that stops from 1.0.0: 1) ABI interface and bindings. They are not stable right now and i am planning to change some logic in the nearest future 2) Dictionaries, i have implemented them in correct way in core libraries, but haven't ported everything to TACT 3) Improve random function. I think compiler must enforce randomize_lt before calling any random function, this is a serious breaking change that could alter behaviour. 4) Remove abi.pack_slice / abi.pack_cell and introduce .toCell in structures itself  Nothing else seems to be breaking changes

Steve: Ofc solving bugs is important, but it wouldn't introduce breaking changes

Steve: Ah yes, i need a simple centralized helper service to upload bindings during deploy

‚Äî 2023-01-04 ‚Äî

Steve: Just relased a version that is incompatible with previous, it changes the way get methods expect arguments and return values. Also abi.pack_slice and abi.pack_cell was removed, new random functions  https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.7.0

Howard: oh abi.pack_cell was removed ü§£ (reply to 949)

Steve: Yes

Howard: ok. I removed the syntax for abi.pack_cell and got this error when compile. (Using ^0.7.0 already

Steve: Please post the code to GitHub

Howard: https://gist.github.com/howardpen9/713e22366604cace12f7c13a1ff18abf (reply to 963)

Steve: I will take a look

Howard: ok, founded, it's related to the .toSlice() method (reply to 964)

Steve: What do you mean? (reply to 966)

Steve: asSlice?

Steve: Ah I see

Steve: No type checking for declaration hm

Steve: check 0.7.1, should show a correct error

Howard: Question about multi-calls in Contract:  I have the contract logic that will trigge like this. I am thinking that how I can set in 'value' field, to make sure the Tx will not failed? (Or any Mode I should set in Send function with parameters)  Because when I tried this at this moment, my contract will get Auction Failed.

Daniil: Maybe you're trying to send more than your contract's balance? (reply to 972)

Daniil: Sum of both calls' values must be less than balance

Howard: I thought it failed because I use SendRemainingValue in first Send functions, I guess.

Daniil: probably that's the reason I had a similar problem few days ago (reply to 977)

Daniil: That "sendremainingvalue" mode doesn't take in account other outgoing messages

Daniil: And if you use that mode in first outgoing msg, the second one won't have anything to send (reply to 977)

Howard: then how you set value in each internal Txs?

Daniil: It all depends on what logic do you need to implement (reply to 981)

Daniil: If contracts 2 and 3 don't require you to attach some additional value to a msg, you can just send some little constant amount to cover the fees

Daniil: And if you really want to send "all remaining balance", you can try subtracting the fee from contract's balance manually and send the remaining

Howard: then the next common issued is that, how we set for min_balance for a contract to maintain its functionality usually? In Steve's Jetton implementation, he keep 0.1 TON for a wallet contract tho.

Daniil: Yes, you should keep some little amount on balance (reply to 985)

Howard: ok ok

Steve: That‚Äôs the question of the year, but in general you manually estimate how you need in each case. Fees are fixed in ton or they would go down, not higher. (reply to 972)

Steve: Kind of, but I am not using really this in non Jetton contracts, if you need your contract without money for less than say 6 months it is ok not to keep storage (reply to 985)

Steve: For jettons the issue that someone could keep them for years

Steve: Currently it is impossible to spend more than one ton in gas fees so this is your higher limit, you can always return remaining tons

Howard: yeh, maybe I can set a receive method for owner to withdraw all the funds there

Howard: I am thinking the custom_payload in practice. It's a Cell.   Is there best way to transition the Int to a Cell`?

Steve: Yes we are using this scheme usually since it is much more predictable and also saves on gas fees (reply to 992)

Daniil: Int to a cell -> just make the cell with a single (u)int256 or whatever size do you need (reply to 993)

Daniil: /report (reply to 997)

Howard: /report (reply to 997)

Howard: yeh, I think I need some example to learn how people deal with Txs in paralleled. Especially accessing different receive method. üò¢ The Tx all at failed with Auction Failed. (reply to 984)

Howard: any example with SendPayGasSeparately guys?

Dario: To send two messages that is likely to forward unused gas, do something like this:  int gas = (msg_value - (storage_fee + GAS_USAGE+(fwd_gas_estimated * 2)) / 2; And mode 0 on both messages.  you can use an hardencoded value for gasusage OR compute it dynamically based on gas price

Dario: In tact,.idk how to do it. IMO there might be a static parser of the code that assume all conditions to true and estimate gas usage at the most, so we can use gas_usage everywhere and get pretty accurate estimations (reply to 1003)

Howard: I tried to type ton("0.1") but seems it will forward the all TON to next contract. (reply to 1003)

Howard: Thanks for reply, will try right now. (reply to 1003)

Dario: You should nt use hardencoded values (reply to 1005)

Howard: we changed the Read contract structure as well?

Howard: the old method shows the error now.ü•∂ü•≤

Howard: how to access contract's get method right now>? Used to be accessing import { createExecutorFromRemote } from "ton-nodejs"; like here on TonBet https://github.com/ex3ndr/tonbet/blob/668b9a57d0b91f6e893f2c4b4e17d2265a7052ec/sources/contract.read.ts#L42

Howard: not the TS expert, but since we changed the compiled file structure. How can I access get method now like this for NFT collection?

Howard: was easy like this to get smartContract data, but I think we changed the way to call the get function?

Howard: would be happy to see other people share how to fetch the data onchain on Tact template repo!  I will prepare with test file to test my contract first.

Howard: how we generated this events codeüòÖ (reply to 950)

Howard: Still will got error once using the .asSlice when I set a StringBuilder with a coming Cell datatype üòÖ (reply to 968)

Steve: Isn‚Äôt I told you to use new libraries several times?

Howard: Sorry, I am not familiar with TS libraries. Are these correct? (reply to 1017)

Steve: Yes

Steve: Ton-nodejs is deprecated

Howard: is there a way that I give a "String" in default and put it as a Cell data type?  Now I only put it as    self.individual_content = emptyCell();

Howard: This is the code that I am working on for NFT implementation on Tact. (reply to 1021)

Howard: Yes, there has a way to put String in default for the content you can put initially.   Using "String Here".asComment(); to put it as Cell. (reply to 1021)

Steve: no, how can you put a string into binary tree?

Howard: üòÇ I need a cheat sheet. I just want to put a string append together tho

‚Äî 2023-01-05 ‚Äî

Howard: Hi guys, is there any way I can let NFT item 1 contract fetch data from NFT Item 2 in Tact? like this

Howard: I am trying to fetch data from Item 2 contract back to fetch 1 to do the comparison.   Like here in Solidity

Steve: no data sharing in ton, only sending messages

Lev: Literally 1984 (reply to 1029)

Lev: But the NFT standart has an op-code for getting the data, so you can send the message and then act on the reply from the second item

Lev: Ofc it depends on what you need to do, but I'd say it's kind of like this: 1. You do everything until you need to fetch the data 2. You save the intermediate variables (if you need) into the storage 3. You send the message with the request to the second item 4. You handle the response in recv_internal() by checking if a message is coming from the second item 5. You continue doing stuff with the information

Howard: I am trying to implement the own feature for the Dapp.... Thinking how I can solve this

Howard: More like a game based on NFT. So people can transfer, sell it so on so for. And NFT itself also has the other value that I can track, fetch to offline and show on website so on so for.

Howard: recv_internal() in FunC is more like receive() method in Tact, right? (reply to 1032)

Lev: Probably, yeah (reply to 1036)

Steve: i welcome you to review what tact generates, it compiles to FunC (reply to 1036)

Steve: btw on this openai screenshot it is just a reading function that you can emulate offchain, you have to do this in dapp itself (reply to 1027)

Howard: this is a great topic. Interesting. I will try and implement like this. Thank you. (reply to 1032)

Howard: really not a expert in TypeScript. Can we add an example for contract.read.ts again?  Try to fetch the data from my contract to verify the result.

Steve: did you open contract?

Howard: yeh, I just deployed on testnet and test it by fetching the data. Because I haven't familiar write in test at this moment.

Howard: Since I usually use createExecutorFromRemote to check the data. Now it's abandoned.

Steve: again this is ton-nodejs it is deprecated and not going to work

Howard: OK, this is the latest way to read contract data since after you compile successfully.

Roman: Dear developers, üëã   I'm Roman, a Developer Onboarding Manager at TON Foundation.  Recently, TON Footstep about Tact documentation was launched. @iftryalexg made a structure for future documentation and will implement it.   We aim to make the best documentation we can in an open and transparent way with help of community.  üÜî Everyone is welcome to read the documentation plan in the ton-foostep:  https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/105  If any questions about documentation, this chat is the best place for discussion and continuous improvement.   The most valuable contribution would be: - which examples of using Tact do you lack? - what guides for Tact do we need first? - documentation plan improvements?  For any Tact language ideas, bugs, and feedback, please (1) create an issue and (2) post the link here.  Let's build the future of TON together! üíé

Howard: hi all, I am trying to read on-chain data (again!)  With the latest template, I can't understand how to decode the structure we pointed out..... anyone know how we decoded this? It changed with the last version.

Howard: anyone? üòÖ (reply to 1049)

Steve: it automatically decoded

Howard: Btw since I am working on NFT standard, I noticed that when I using TonKeeper to transfer the NFT, got exitCode:9 Cell underflow

Howard: does that mean my NFT with Transfer message receive implementation has the issued?

Steve: try to use ton.cx and find your transaction there

Steve: it will show you everything in detail

Steve: https://testnet.ton.cx for testnet

Steve: https://test-explorer.toncoin.org

Howard: oh, ok! I just need add a quote like this to read a Struct from new libraries!! (reply to 1052)

Howard: Is there has any way I can track what method code I will get in my message list?   I have 5++ of receive implement on my contract. I can't figure out which one is which lmao

Howard: Can I give arbitrary code for them? Like the TEP62 NFT standard gave the method code specifically.

Steve: you can try to read func

Howard: I will! Since I haven't finished the NFT standard in Tact. Can you help? (reply to 1062)

Howard: I can't passed the TonKeeper transfer method. (reply to 964)

Howard: Hi @steve_kite I think I reached a maximum charatars in IE. How could I deploy the contract to testnet?

Steve: IE?

Steve: For large contracts I usually copy link to the notes app and open it on the iPhone

Steve: iOS doesn‚Äôt have limitations for links at all, you can pack even 1gb of data in the link

Howard: It will like this

Howard: any suggestion?

Steve: You need url safe encoding I forgot to add it again

Howard: Please addüôå I want to code more!

Alex: Hello, TON developers!üëã Ready to step into the 2023 TON massive adoption year? Let‚Äôs do it with Tact!  TLDR  Tact is a high-level, scalable language designed to improve the usability of smart contract development for TON. If you've long wanted to dive into smart contract development, now is the time when you can start from the very basics as a Tact developer. Definitely, your participation will be especially appreciated if you are an experienced FunC developerü§ù.  The Tact language project was originally initiated in the summer of 2022 when the original concept was designed.  In December 2022, the Tact compiler development continued, and currently work is in full swing.üåã   What next?  To improve the quality of the Tact compiler an important requestü•∫  to the great TON community is to play with the compiler according to the template project.   If you will find a BIG problem with the Tact compiler itself, we will be very happy if you tell us about it in the chat or in git issues. Also, feel free to ask your questions Tact questions in chat.   If you have any questions about the Tact documentation DM me @iftryalexg  - I will disclose all questions ASAP in the documentation or answer you with a link that helps you.ü§ì (forwarded from Alex)

Stanislav: Hi! I like tact design at first glance. For me it is similar to js&golang in some way(Maybe because I work only with themüòÅ). Is there support for tact language in any IDE?

Alex: Text editor highlight is currently unavailable and will be developed with the community's help in the near future. I think it will be Jet Brains/VS Code in the first order. (reply to 1076)

Howard: Yeh. VS to code. I usually change the syntax highlight to set it as Rust! Which is helpful. (reply to 1076)

Howard: Is the Transfer function that TonKeeper wallet called for NFT is different from the Transfer we defined here in TEP62?   https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md (reply to 912)

Howard: how do we do the comparison, since the self.get method will need add the question mark "?" for the value.

Steve: !! forces to be non-null but would crash if value is a null

Howard: wow! Nice. (reply to 1089)

Howard: sorry, how to solve the deploy URL too large?

Howard: my deploy code is over 10,000++ nowüòÇ

Howard: is this official Twitter?

datboi: deploy by yourself, via tonutils-go, for example  https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/master/example/deploy-nft-collection/main.go (reply to 1091)

Howard: oh nice! (reply to 1094)

Howard: can we deploy the conde through API as well in TypeScript?

Steve: I think we can, it is just you won‚Äôt be able to send message from a correct address

datboi: why not? you just need to send a message with StateInit inside. i guess TypeScript has some libraries to send messages via API, such as tonweb (reply to 1096)

Steve: Please no tonweb here

datboi: anyways, it‚Äôs trivial to send message, Tact compiler must give you StateInit code and data

Steve: Not universal and I prefer not to have any keys on working machine

Howard: out of my knowledge! ü§£

Howard: oh, that make sense. Yeh, it's totally different than the way we developing on Solidity.   Interacting with chain through Wallet then wouldn't need to store the key in the local .env file. (reply to 1101)

Steve: Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt want to make it default way to deploy even for development

Steve: But I guess it could be done

Steve: Also you can just use ledger I am not sure if this is a feasible way to someone

Howard: so how I can deploy the code right now tho? Or I just learn how to write the test case right now first. (reply to 1106)

Steve: You can use normal api and a library to send message the same way you are doing tests

Howard: Sorry, how we get those json part.... in test file? (reply to 950)

Steve: It is autogenerated by jest

Howard: how you got those? Can't find any description about this part in template repo üòÖ

Howard: 3 major issues:  1. How to put string URL in Tact code for NFT content.  2. The deploy code is too large that can't deploy through TonKeeper  3. How to generate test cases from jest

datboi: 1. you can check NFT content cell generation in tonutils-go framework https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/master/ton/nft/content.go (reply to 1112)

Howard: omg, all go-lang? üòÇ

datboi: at least, it‚Äôs easy to read :)

Steve: We are almost ready to 1.0.0

Steve: TACT reached feature and ABI freeze in 0.8.1  This is the last breaking release before 1.0.0. I expect compiler to have some possible bugs, but if you are testing your contracts you should be fine. I recommend it to early-stage production development. For example if you are going to release in a month-two, TACT is a good choise for you.  Changes: * Dictionaries in typescript bindings * You can now generate bindings for non-tact contracts by writing a specially formatted JSON file (we are welcome to contribute another ways to describe contracts!) * Stable and predictable ABI that you can use in your explorers and apps to generate a UI for working with a smart contract  https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.8.0 (forwarded from TON Development News)

davide: is there also a guide to tact,? (reply to 1117)

Steve: Nope

Steve: Just examples and stuff

Howard: Hi, can we help to solve the issued for URL too large? (reply to 1117)

Steve: Have you tried to send a transaction via ton library directly?

Howard: nope.... is there an example? Just need to solve the  initial contract code

Howard: the write, read the smart contract is ok for me. I followed the template repo then.

Steve: https://github.com/ton-community/ton

Howard: seems need a template for me to deploy the code I got after compile the tact..... (reply to 1125)

Alex: Can anybody share another example of *.deploy.ts that relates to Tact language contract(from Tact examples or your own)? It will help to learn how it works faster.

Howard: Change Line 3, 10, based on the .ts file you got in output folder.  https://github.com/ton-community/tact-template/blob/main/sources/contract.deploy.ts (reply to 1128)

Alex: Thank you, this is clear part for me too. I want to see more specific examples for different cases.  For example, in payouts.tact we should invoke init(address, public key) in payouts.deploy.ts. (reply to 1129)

Howard: it's just an Address data type and a Int data type (reply to 1130)

Howard: Example for the other contract.deploy.ts

Howard: once you compile you can find the packed that encoded in output folder.   And based on message you define previously in .tact file, you can find them in there.   And just copy / paste based the message data type you got.

Howard: anyone got it? üòÖ ngmi (reply to 1126)

Howard: Hi @steve_kite I am using the new suggest you asked.   And it failed because I think I am using the library generated a new account that doesn't have TON in balance, right?

datboi: yep (reply to 1137)

datboi: api key is needed (reply to 1138)

datboi: Please no tonweb here (forwarded from Steve Korshakov)

datboi: and he asked for this (reply to 1141)

datboi: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Howard: ohhhhh? I think he means accept with TonClient

Howard: ohhhhhh, level up.

Howard: OKOK

Howard: Since I deployed the contract successfully, ExitCode 7 shows the TypeCheckError

Herm√®s: üëç

Steve: Tonweb doesn‚Äôt have bindings supported, and rate limits and general instability or classical api is the reason we are using TonClien4

Steve: Worked just fine with locally installed tonkeeper on macos

Howard: This is super cool! (reply to 1155)

Howard: got this error since only happend in @0.8.2.  There is no error to compile if I put Tact back to @0.7.1

Steve: it said what it said

Howard: sorry, I don't understand. Is it any line of code wrong? Or just the disclaim of the data type was wrong in my code initially.

Steve: you declared a field with remaining modifier and made it optional, it is impossible combination

Howard: OK, find the issued. I got your point now.  Yes, for ^0.8.1, the data type you set in message field now can't with question mark '?' now.

Howard: Hi, wondering whether the changed for non-empty accept in initial Message setting make this.   My contract now will only get exit code 7 in the first message Transfer (followed the standard of TEP62 message structure)

Howard: especially forward_payload format might be the empty I guess? (0xff)

Howard: OK, Exit Code 7 happened if you did not fully use the initial data you set on Contract_B you generated from contact_A. (reply to 1163)

Howard: What is the error code 100 means? Can't find in my Tact compiled TS file.

Steve: i have seen it somewhere, not exported error, try to check func code

Howard: By the way, the latest integrate for Tact contract report is quite cool. Well done Steve.

Howard: And the plug-in feature to trigged the local TonKeeper is super helpful. Thanks!   Now I can focus on coding Tact. (reply to 1157)

Howard: about Send Parameters, I know you can set the bounce message for funds back to previous sender.   But is it possible that I can set, "if this txs failed, do X, Y or Z?"   Because I noticed if the Tx to NFT Item failed, it will only put the TON back to Collection contract. Which is not I want.   I want to implement that any txs failed, go to this NFT Item owner. (Which more make sense for me

Howard: Is there has official Tact Twitter account?

Kirill: Working on it (reply to 1173)

Herm√®s: üëçüèæ

Howard: what will it usually looks like in the FunC files we got in output folder? (reply to 1168)

‚Äî 2023-01-10 ‚Äî

Howard: Oh. Now my code is like this: contract A ‚û°Ô∏è contract B ‚û°Ô∏è contract C.   - It's fantastic to think of a new way to design the protocol architecture, especially since each contract can't know the contract status in any block height.   - The way you want to track the data on the other contract is to let 'the current contract' send a message to the other and set a customized receive() method to send the transactions back with the status for this contract.

Daniil: Also note that it's not always safe to rely on the data that contract send you in a message. Its state may change while the message is on the way to the destination (reply to 1178)

Daniil: I think in most cases it's fine, but sometimes you should think of something more complex

Howard: Is it the original issued for TVM? Any example that how you solve this?

Howard: is it has a way like Event in Solidity so I can keep track the data/value/status for the SmartContract I just interacted?

Steve: not yet, but could be in the future yes

datboi: how will it be implemented? through external out messages? (reply to 1183)

Steve: May be yes

Howard: Can I say that the empty receive() method call are the way that set a default Txs once people send TON to the contract without "any" message or comment?

Steve: Yes

Steve: Empty comment or without any payload at all

Howard: About some standard libraries:  1. since simpleSend converted to nativeSendMessage, it seems doesn't support with contract in default yet.   2. For reply() method call: what can we leverage in this for the bounced message about body?   I mean if the body informations will bounced back, can we design a receive method to catch this error then do other behavior? (let's say ContractA -> Contract B (bounces the message) -> Contract A (catch the message)   3. For the nativeReserve, there has only 3 usage in `Tact Example`, can we say that: "If the mode is set to 0, the output action will reserve exactly the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 2, the output action will reserve at most the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 1 or 3, the output action will reserve all but the specified amount of nano-toncoins."

Howard: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/docs/stdlib.md  Kind of confuse for me when reading this part. Will like to fully understand how to use this standard method.

Daniil: 2. Yes, in the contract A add some if-statement which will catch messages with bounced flag (reply to 1190)

Howard: - then that will bounced back to Contract A and rely on reply() method I designed in Contract A?  - What if I set a empty receive() in contract A as well? It's different, right? receive() is for any TON transfer with empty message.  But tx / message from a bounced situation is having the message inside, right?

Alex: I did a mistake in the description: we will send body to the sender who had sent a message to our contract(so dst of bounced message does not depends on the body). So the message body will be according to what you placed there - comment or anything else.  About catching messages, as I understand if we want to do something special in the contract we need to specify our actions with opcodes. And something special, I mean some actions, that we will do after getting this. Technically we can define actions based on bounced messages, but it seems like bad behavior. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong here, everything I saw contracts just ignores bounced messages(recognized by flag). In my understanding bounce generally serves only for returning funds.  Maybe somebody knows an example, where we do some actions after bounced message gets?

Steve: The bounced message body has just first 256 bits of the original one

Howard: Excuse me, what do you mean "Original one"? (reply to 1195)

Howard: And by the way, would like to follow up the "test" case you shared in Tact template. How you got thos json format string like here? (reply to 1109)

Steve: They generated by jest

Steve: Remove them and they will be generated on next run

Howard: Oh, it's just basic jest? How possible they can integrate without change any? Let me do more research. Thanks. (reply to 1200)

Steve: No specific integration needed it just gets the object it received and put it into test source code (reply to 1201)

Howard: But I think it would be easy to pitch the sentence, ‚Äúwithout learning new libraries or test modules(hardhat, Ganache, Foundry...etc.), you can test your Tact code quickly in TypeScript

Howard: Is there any way I can get the random number? Try to build a lottery example for newbies.

Howard: By the way, for the tact implementation with the NFT standard, I am still stuck with the content URL part. Did anyone try that as well? Packaging the String to the Cell.

datboi: https://github.com/puppycats/ton-random (reply to 1206)

Howard: Thanks. But damn, I cant rear FunC yet. (reply to 1208)

Daniil: There should be some native random() function in Tact (reply to 1206)

Daniil: But note that its result can be predicted if you don't use some additional tricks

Daniil: One of these tricks is implemented in this repository ^ (reply to 1208)

datboi: you just send message to the smart-contract and get reply in another message (reply to 1209)

Daniil: Yeah, you can just use the deployed contract. But if you want some more customization, check the code :)  I'm also writing an article about RNG for ton docs, but it won't be ready this week (reply to 1213)

Steve: Yes tact has random function

Steve: No need to randomize it like in func, it is done automatically

Howard: Probably none-proper question: But how can we convert "Treasure" data type to "Address" data type.

Howard: I will get the auction failed with 2 send in the same execution. For example: In this function, I trigged a first Send method with 0.1 TON (in theory).  Then send a second Send method. But no matter what I tried, still will get "Auction failed".   How can I solve this?

Steve: What‚Äôs the value of incoming message?

Howard: sorry, "incoming message"?

Steve: Everything is done as a reaction to incoming message

Howard: for first Send message, may I just send 0.1 TON, then send all the remaining value in second Send method? This is what i want.

Howard: I am guessing that it's not able to implement 2 send method at same time.

Howard: (Like what I did over there. It just failed)

Howard: hey guys, might be a wired question but: For sending message to a contract address initially, we have to put body and data right?

Daniil: do you want to deploy new contract from your contract, or do you want to just send some message? (reply to 1249)

Steve: And code

Daniil: to deploy you need both code and data. body is not necessary if you're deploying

Howard: Contract A will generate contractB, like NFT Collection -> multiple NFT Item Contracts. (reply to 1250)

Daniil: then contract A need to send a message to contract B address with code and data cells. body is not necessary (only if your contract B requires it right after the deployment) (reply to 1253)

Howard: I think there are using queryId? as a index to distinguish the orders for deploying the contract? (reply to 1242)

Howard: üëæ Looking for people check this together~ ü´° (reply to 1247)

Howard: Is it possible for a user to pass in a 'String Text' and store it in a smart contract without worrying about the original text being known?   For example, in a Rock-Paper-Scissors game on Solidity like this one: https://github.com/ojroques/ethereum-rockpaperscissors#reveal-phase

Howard: ü´†

Howard: I think I will just keep test in test-net production ü§£ü§£ü§£

Howard: Since followed the TEP62 here, we have a get function called get_nft_content. Let's say we have the URL for Collection & NFT Item were as follows.   My question here is that, what is the individual_content means here? I might not want to prepare 10,000 different URL if I have  10,000 NFT Item in total.

Howard: I know Seitaro explained before. But yeh, still stuck in here. (reply to 904)

Daniil: what's the problem with 10000 different URLs? (reply to 1265)

Daniil: often people have collections where each NFT is an unique image

Daniil: so they must have different URLs :)

Howard: Yes, I mean, I already can put index input as a parameter to generate each NFTs' URL (based on index_id)   Then why I need individual_content as a second parameter as an Input here?

Steve: Because it could store content on chain and you can change it if you wish

Howard: how will you go next to implement this part?   Append the URL (content) must using String or StringBuilder in Tact, right?

Steve: The problem is that standard somehow requires non standard prefix of a single byte

Steve: This is not supported by tact right now, but you can always work with slices directly

Howard: non standard prefix of a single byte? Can you explain more.

Howard: All slice solution might be looks like this..... can compile, but not sure is correct or not.

Steve: You forgot assign new builder to a variable

Seitaro: Well, if you have offchain metadata (via url) and each nft is unique, each nft should have it's own url. However, you can for instance store common prefix in collection like "myawesomecollection.ton/nfts/" and individual content will only contain suffix of each nft. It is possible that you mixed two concepts: collection metadata (metadata of collection as a whole set), one per collection, nft metadata - one per item. (reply to 1265)

Howard: OK, then I will try again to let my NFT standard in Tact can works on https://testnet.explorer.tonnft.tools/ üòµ‚Äçüí´üò≠

Howard: new builder? (reply to 1277)

Howard: anyone got this issued when deploying the contract?

Steve: I just released a new version with updated stdlib: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/releases/tag/v0.8.7

Steve: it allows to build a string that conforms this standard and allows to dangerously convert slice to a string

Howard: when I read a Cell data in the contract(follow the TEP62)  the Cell I got is like this "x{68747470733A2F2F732E67657467656D732E696F2F6E66742D73746167696E672F632F363238663661623830373730363061376138643532643633}"  How to turn it back to String I stored initially.

Howard: when I deploying my TACT contract code through local TonKeeper, it will failed like this after a while of times in execution. (1-2mins)

Howard: Might be only because my initial code is too large?

Howard: yeh, I think there has some limitation for TonKeeper API now? Can't deploy contract properly if my initial code is too large still.   Just will expired the loading time per Txs on TonKeeper? I can share the URL then let you try out tho.

Howard: Hi, what is the usage or purpose for nativeReserve?  Because "to maintain" a contract alive, we need keep some TON in it for storage cost?    Then what is this the difference we just set a constant number like here in Jetton standard as well?       const minTonsForStorage: Int = ton("0.01"); (reply to 1189)

Howard: I solved this by using TonClient API.... sadly. (reply to 1300)

Herm√®s: ü´°

Alex: For wallet.tact example Tact compiler makes init function with Bigint arguments: init(key: bigint, walletId: bigint)   In the ton library, we are working with BN numbers. Can somebody advise, how can we use ton library to invoke init() function in this case? Cast BN to bigint or something else?

Steve: New ton library works with bigint

Steve: But you can always do .toString(10) for both types

Howard: I noticed when I using Send method with an address I assigned before can't receive the funds.   For example, like this: self.owner_address were the initial input I put in. But it some how router to an Unknown wallet address!  If I use TonHub address as an input setting initially, this self.owner_address will be router to an unknown address (wired)

Howard: is it possible that the input address will change the format since after we put as input initially?

Alex: That code repeats what we do in tact-template. From this side, I didn‚Äôt meet any issues with changing owner‚Äôs Addresses. In the deployed contract I got the exact owner, that I specified in init() function.  Which way did you calculate your owner address when deploying your contract? (reply to 1308)

Howard: I am using testAddress libraries in "ton-emulator"

Howard: Thinking might be some shift for the address?

Alex: I used Address object, shift via Address.parse(); But it seems to work equally.  Did I understand correctly, your owner is another smart contract(wallet?) deployed earlier?

Howard: now, owner_address was the initial wallet address I gave for the Collection Address.   But the owner_address just changed since after I deployed the code and read on-chain data, it just fallback a totally different address.   I am assume that the code got shift since after we compile successfully.

Howard: for example, maybe the Tact line of code is too large or too many parameters in one contract. Can't sure.

Alex: Can you resend the address of the collection? (reply to 1313)

Howard: can we hardcoded the owner_address initially?   because like the example here I put for owner address, will change after I deploy the code (seems the contract didn't catch correctly even I send the right format of wallet address)

Howard: I mean, since I deployed this collection contract, using get function to get owner_address was different with the initial I put in. Even I didn't do any change for this owner parameter.

Alex: Since I successfully deployed wallet.tact, I think we have no such issue. wallet.tact (in the compiled version) is big enough too. (reply to 1314)

Alex: Well, I think you could get the same address but in another form. Could you resend here your address in text or link, I want to take a look too. (reply to 1317)

‚Äî 2023-01-15 ‚Äî

Howard: I am still debugging which part of the initial code I pointed to the contract is causing issues.  There are still some type check errors. I think I may have triggered an edge case for Tact, as it is able to compile the code even with errors present.  Some errors will only show up with an Exit Code 7, while others don't.  Additionally, some errors cause the wrong address to be stored in the contract status.

Howard: It sounds foolish, but it actually happened! I initially pointed the owner address to my wallet address when deploying the Collection contract, but for some reason, since I read the contract status, it stored the wrong wallet address (i.e. an unknown type of address).  After thinking for a while and testing for hours, I am assuming that even though I put the initial code, the TVM might have caught and stored the wrong address. It is beyond my understanding. (reply to 1316)

Howard: Do not set the get function with a question mark, even though the NFT item address is predictable.  I think the question mark will cause the data set to take up more space in bits/cells, which may cause the original data you passed to the contract to be shifted.  For example, the owner_address we declared initially when deploying this collection contract.

Howard: anyone can share some testTON, I run out of it again. Please DM me.

Howard: Since I am using a mapping to store a series of tier level for the users:  - I am using Int? since Tact@^0.7.0 requested. So to achieve the needs, I am using the !! since after the minRequirement.  But I will get the error no matter what.  What should I do to passed this?

Howard: I implement this functions in empty receive() method, but contract will not do any since receive the TON.   thinking myBalance() didn't work here

Howard: maybe using             mode: SendRemainingBalance + SendIgnoreErrors, is proper way

Steve: Balance includes value of incoming message and therefore always more than is available since it is before gas substraction

Howard: so best way is mode: SendRemainingBalance + SendIgnoreErrors?   How about the difference in sort in order? Like mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendRemainingBalance (reply to 1328)

Steve: No difference

Herm√®s: How do we know it's not ‚Äúpredictable‚Äù? (reply to 1218)

Steve: It is up to validators

Daniil: It is (reply to 1331)

Daniil: Unless you use some additional tricks like skipping a block

Howard: nice nice

Herm√®s: hi guys, trying to check the Send methods with a trigger. I noticed that the Txs might failed based on "TON value" I sent? Can't sure why.   Got this in TS file:  5: { message: `Integer out of expected range },`  But I wasn't claim this in my Tact code.

Howard: Hey, how we filter "a day" in Tact? I know TVM using LT to define the time/block height on TON.   But how we value a 24hrs/7days/ or even 30days?

Howard: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/docs/statements.md   I checked and know that there has now() in Tact.

Steve: now is unixtime

Howard: I tried a bit in code: it was supposed to execute the Tx every 24hrs, but it seems unrealistic since we can call the function every 24hrs off-chain.

Howard: is there any way I can get the length of a mapping? And seems we don't have array in Tact.

Steve: No length

Howard: Just tried out a "String" msg and got an error code 5:     5: { message: `Integer out of expected range }`   whyü§£

Steve: Because ints are maximum 257/256 bits

Step: any tact example for nft item with collection?

Howard: @Kingphin not perfect. But it can be tagged as collection on explorer. (reply to 1247)

Howard: Would be great if you can add:   1/ content part with implement String input adding in the contract.    2/ let it enable to transfer owner on TonKeeper.

‚Äî 2023-01-16 ‚Äî

Howard: @steve_kite any solution we can achieve something like that? (reply to 1342)

Howard: I think in TVM, there is no way to know the exact length for a data set? So we should create the new address if so?

Howard: Like we did in NFT Item, if we have a collection with 10,000 items, then we will have 10,001 contract addresses.

Howard: can you shared with us why we need skip first 32 bits here? (reply to 1345)

Howard: 1 & 2 both can't work for meüòµ‚Äçüí´

Step: bot? (reply to 1355)

Step: just now saw in gh issues

Daniil: are you doing anything with the result of randomInt()? (reply to 1355)

Daniil: maybe you just try to multiply it by something and it causes an overflow

Step: i also got similar exit code with func code dont know how to fix

Step: int forward_amount = in_msg_body~load_coins();     throw_unless(708, slice_bits(in_msg_body) >= 1);      int rest_amount = my_balance - min_tons_for_storage();     if (forward_amount) {         rest_amount -= (forward_amount + fwd_fees);     }     int need_response = response_destination.preload_uint(2) != 0; ;; if NOT addr_none: 00     if (need_response) {         rest_amount -= fwd_fees;     }

Step: something strange with rest_amount

Step: nft transfer (reply to 1361)

Step: related to this (reply to 1361)

Herm√®s: where/how you got this (reply to 1364)

Step: here https://t.me/tondev_eng/19743  computation phase ¬ª server run (reply to 1365)

Howard: Hi, @steve_kite  since 0.8.0, noticed that the mapping get method will always got the error in compile. Like this:

Howard: I follow the Tact example and using this will still got error.

Howard: I am testing random() right now. And funny that the TonKeeper can know what is the result for random number... (WTF  Here is my code, I put random number to do a calculate!

Howard: But once I calling the contract, it will show what is the team code I got!!! ü´•ü´£

Howard: So I do some tricks, I do not post the team_code that I got from random Int, I binding into the message to send to next contract rather than exposure as a initial code for contract B.

Howard: then TonKeeper will not able to decode the message I assume.

Herm√®s: I am thinking that we need a better way to get "random number" (reply to 1373)

Steve: What‚Äôs the problem with a normal random why use low level internal functions instead?

Howard: waht do you mean? (reply to 1376)

Howard: why use low level internal functions ?

Steve: Why you are using nativeRandom

Howard: I wanna get a random number tho!

Howard: or should I using this? random(min: Int, max: Int): Int

Alex: It seems so https://t.me/tactlang/1218 (reply to 1383)

Howard: Roger that!

Howard: ü´°

Howard: üòµ‚Äçüí´

Howard: I am using it as random Integer pick, and it always return 1 or 2 since I divided with 3. I think the function is predictable.

Howard: You can test it out. Maybe I made something wrong. (reply to 1390)

Step: what is self.record  dictionary? (reply to 1390)

Steve: I bet you are not using random again and doing your own magic lol

Steve: Ofc it would be more predictable

Howard: Just the place I store the record (reply to 1392)

Howard: like I showed in here (reply to 1388)

Step: howmany record we can store like this?

Howard: mmmmm I am guessing it's predictable if you send the exactly same TON and using same Addresses. (reply to 1394)

Howard: then highly chance get a out put which is the same as previous.

Howard: will always get this error since using the randomInt() I think.       5: { message: `Integer out of expected range }`

Howard: Only the error in the initial Txs, and wouldn't get error even the exactly same Txs!

Alex: Not entirely clear, what do you try to build?  Currently, we discuss this Tact language project that does not need to build separately. Also, an example of the Tact project here.  Maybe I was wrong and you already learn this, then could you share some details of what do you trying to do? (reply to 1405)

‚Äî 2023-01-17 ‚Äî

Howard: Have you checked and maybe help with me working this? @Kingphin (reply to 1348)

Howard: Question: How we can multi-sending the transaction in Tact?  I mean it is based on Gas Cost right? Then I am trying like this: Building a Int => Address mapping list, and using do method to adding one my one to get receiver address.  But you know, it's unrealistic because the gas used is huge here.   Anyone has better solution for this? Since we don't have array in Tact.

Howard: I implement it with 0.01 TON per message Txs, is there any better way to do so? Sending Message and without paying high gas fee.   Heard that using the method I did here, will only able to send with 253 accounts/messages?

Howard: üëç (reply to 793)

Steve: You are looking at the old tact, that was built using ocaml, new one is written in typescript and doesn‚Äôt have anything in common with old one and was designed from scratch (reply to 1405)

Howard: Hi @steve_kite , is this a proper way to send a series of addresses? I noticed that there is a concept in TVM called High-load wallets that we haven't implement in Tact I guess? (reply to 1409)

Steve: High wallet wallets are just generic wallets

Step: how to store unlimited number of address in a array/variable? (reply to 1416)

Step: please send any example (reply to 1417)

Howard: there is no array sir (reply to 1417)

Step: yea something equivalent (reply to 1419)

Step: üòÅ

Howard: have you checked the NFT standard tho. Let's finish that üòÇüòÇüòÇ (reply to 1418)

Andrew: yeah, thanks, I was working with the wrong repo (reply to 1406)

Herm√®s: üî•

Herm√®s: Is it okay to get this kind of error syntax warning when trying to read the FunC file we got after compiling?

Steve: This is a bug in func syntax highlighter

Step: should report here? https://github.com/ton-community/vscode-func/issues (reply to 1426)

Steve: Yes

Herm√®s: anyone know why my Send method can't execute with second one?

Herm√®s: even I keep mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendRemainingValue, without in first one.

Howard: Generic means‚Ä¶.? (reply to 1416)

Step: normal wallets like v3 v4? (reply to 1434)

Daniil: is there a VS Code extension for tact highlighting?

Howard: Using Rust (reply to 1437)

‚Äî 2023-01-18 ‚Äî

Herm√®s: anyone has the idea? (reply to 1431)

Howard: It works good for me (reply to 1437)

Howard: What is the minimum TON I should prepare for sending a "Text message"?

Howard: in test-net it sometimes cost me: - 0.0140 ton - 0.0061 ton  - etc

Alex: It depends from time passed from last outgoing message. I think you need read about fees to understand how it works in TON.

Alex: I think this is nice article to learn more.  https://ton.org/docs/develop/smart-contracts/fees

Daniil: where are the docs for Map type? I didn't find any in repo

Daniil: I wanted to know what will happen if some key does not exist in map and I call m.get(key). Will it throw an error return null, or maybe something else?

Howard: thanks. #fee (reply to 1445)

Howard: null   That is why you need signed a ? after the datatype (reply to 1447)

Daniil: okay, and then to check if the value is null, I just need to do: let val: Int? = self.someMap.get(123); if (!!val) {     // is not null } else {     // is null }

Daniil: right?

Daniil: what the !! operator does exactly? just checks if the value is null?

Howard: highlight that it must have the value tho (reply to 1454)

Howard: but you will get compiler error in latest version if you wrote like this

Daniil: so is my code snippet above is correct? I just want to make something if there is no such key in map  let val: Int? = self.someMap.get(123); if (VAL_NOT_FOUND) {     // do something }  how do I write it in tact? (reply to 1455)

Howard: Yes

Howard: But there also has another way I think using function, for example.

Daniil: oh I actually found this example in repo

Howard: But assume the easier way for me, I will using if.

Daniil: so we can just compare with null

Daniil: why I can't make a cell like this: beginCell().storeUint(1, 32).endCell() and only like this: endCell(storeUint(beginCell(), 1, 32))  it's actually painful to make cells that way...

Daniil: also strange that empty message structures are forbidden

Kon: We are working on VScode extension for Tact, in 2-4 weeks will be released, we hope... (reply to 1437)

Steve: If someone knows textmate grammars it would be nice to have tact one since it is a common format for web highlighters

Steve: It would be fixed in next releases, this is just the most ancient part of stdlib (reply to 1463)

Howard: I know it's a non-Tact question but: What will it happen for the smart contract if we using SendRemainingBalance to let the balance of an "active" smart contract balance being zero?   #storageFee, Fee Calculate

Daniil: It'll be frozen (reply to 1468)

Howard: the functions totally can't be called or? What is the definition for it?  I am sure I can send Tx anytime to the contract tho.

Steve: balance would be zero, depending on the size of a contract in a months it would be frozen and things would be complicated, eventually in years it would be deleted

Steve: you can unfreeze contract by sending state init data with latest known data and code, but this could be challenging to recover

Daniil: If it's frozen, you still can recover it by sending a message with code and data to it

Howard: then maybe we should implement msgValue in a standard that I can set 0.001 TON for a contract? (reply to 1472)

Howard: Yes, but then my SendParameters will always need with code and data that will make Gas Cost higher or no? (reply to 1473)

Steve: yes, higher

Daniil: Only if it's frozen (reply to 1475)

Daniil: You don't need to send that every time

Steve: code and data from initOf won't work

Steve: you need data and code that was at the moment of freeze, so it is impossible to infer from just contract code

Howard: And after I testing the code in many hours, you can't with multiple context like this:  mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors  + SendRemainingBalance ‚ùå  mode: SendIgnoreErrors  + SendRemainingBalance ‚úÖ mode: SendIgnoreErrors  + SendRemainingValue  ‚úÖ (reply to 1329)

Daniil: that's explained in docs (reply to 1481)

Dario: Do not use sum, use | (reply to 1481)

Howard: ok, will try out. But sometimes still get ExitCode 7 if I didn't put the code and data Cells (reply to 1480)

Daniil: can we write a receiver for some opcode, like receive(0x12345678) {} ?

Daniil: result will be same (reply to 1483)

Steve: no, but you can handle it manutally using receive(msg: Slice) (reply to 1485)

Dario: Yes, but in case he do smt like  int mode = 32 + 2; ..... if(stuff){ mode += 2; }  Using | is better since the mode will still be valid (reply to 1486)

Daniil: I think it would be a good feature (opcode receive) (reply to 1487)

Steve: no plans doing so, what's usecase?

Daniil: just easier interaction

Steve: with what?

Steve: just define a message and work with it

Daniil: is there a possibility to define a message with stuff like "Either" in tl-b scheme? Currently, I only saw "Maybe" by just adding ? after the type (reply to 1493)

Daniil: I thought we can't define some kinds of messages using "message" structure, that's why I asked about opcode receivers

Steve: no, either not specifying how to serialize and instead gives you two options

Daniil: okay

Daniil: even if I have defined some Message, I still need to serialize it myself with Builder to use in send(), right? wouldn't it be easier for people to do like this?: send(SendParameters{     bounce: ...,     to: ...,     value: ...,     mode: ...,     body: MyMessage{         someField1: ...,         someField2: ...     } });  Maybe it's hard to implement in compiler, but I'm just saying my thoughts

Howard: is there any merkle root I can use to store User List? Like the example here? https://github.com/a16z/eth-testnet-drop  1/ In EVM, the gas cost is so high. So one of the solution is that we only store the merkle root to save the spaces we need on-chain.  2/ We don't have array in Tact, then how we can store a list that with Users Addresses' data? And search, calling it each by each?   I am thinking to use the Collection+Item design like NFTs. Correct me if I am wrong. Thanks...

‚Äî 2023-01-19 ‚Äî

Howard: Sharing the code I tried to build for lottery for these two days:  1) It included the if... else if statment in practice. 2) It included some  do... until statment in practice. 3) It included the mapping in practice with set get 4) It included some "ABCDEFG".asComment()  in usage.  5) It included the usage for randomInt()  I have identified that it is not efficient to send text messages and move the prize in the same transaction, as it is not predictable for the gas cost. I was using a constant number for it, but it seems that this is not a good approach.  Please note: 1) If you want to trigger two 'Send' methods in one 'Receive' method job, you should not add 'bounce: false'. The second 'Send' method will not be triggered if you do so.  2) The code still has many bugs and not perfect. Just sharing it for community.

Howard: Is there a way to verify the legitimacy of people claiming to be from the TON Foundation?

Anthony: Can you share the account name? (reply to 1502)

Howard: I am thinking how to search a "unlimited" list in a mapping.... like member_index: map[Int]Address  If I wan to search an Address in the list, I have to use a do... statment. Which is not scalible since the search from 0, 1, 2...etc

Step: use address as key? üòÖ (reply to 1504)

Howard: @ton-community/tx-emulator has been rebranded into @ton-community/sandbox and significantly improved!  It now uses the new ton-core under the hood and is compatible with all the APIs that it provides, making the creation of smart contract wrappers easier than ever!  More importantly though, the blockchain-experimental features have been merged, so you can now emulate whole chains of transactions and even emulate interactions with existing smart contracts from real networks (both mainnet and testnet)!  Together with it we released another package, test-utils, which, along with the new features  of sandbox, significantly simplifies testing of systems of multiple smart contracts.  Check out the examples provided together with sandbox to see the intended way to use it.  Please note that this tool is still in beta, but we would love to hear any feedback from you!  Also, stay tuned for more detailed tutorials for using this tool! (forwarded from TonTech)

Howard: should we update in Tact-template?

‚Äî 2023-01-20 ‚Äî

Alex: @steve_kite could you please add ‚Äútact-hello-world‚Äù branch in tact-template? I want to push a special version of tact-template there. In this version contact.tact will be empty and need to be restored with Tact hello-world guide.

Howard: Yes, I have more feedback on this.   I am currently dealing with transferring multiple addresses in a single transaction. It can be difficult to predict the current balance that the Vault contract still has.   This can make it challenging to work with, especially if we are dealing with a Staking or Vault contract that needs to calculate a fee share.   I highly recommend that we include a syntax in the standard libraries that shows the balance of TON that a contract has (after the current message and subtracting storage fees, etc.). (reply to 1328)

Howard: OK, I crossed the issued there, I took the example and gave a buffer that in there.

Howard: Question: How do we measure the gas cost in the string type on body field?   Is it gas costly? I think I want to send the message to all accounts that hit lucky numbers tho.

Howard: 0.003604 0.003740 (forwarded from Howard)

Howard: Testing some String message in Testnet, wondering how I can better to set a minium Gas setting for sending the text.

Howard: You can send just 0 (forwarded from Andrey Tvorozhkov)

Howard: And use sendrawmessage mode to pay for fees (forwarded from Andrey Tvorozhkov)

Howard: Hi @steve_kite, have we implement same feature in Tact? Sorry, not the expert in FunC

Howard: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/428fa54716e77656a40fb44690512c7a417eebdb/docs/stdlib.md   Because I tested in SendPayGasSeparately already, it seems not what I want neither what he mentioned there.   Seems out of my knowledge or just Tact haven't implement yet.

Alex: If you mean, "can we send message with sendmode = 0", that is default value in Tact, as I remember. (reply to 1517)

Howard: Seems can't. Will got 'Action failed' if I doing so. (reply to 1521)

Kirill: Updated the website with a link to docs: https://tact-lang.org  What else should we put up there? Please share feedback in @tactlang (forwarded from Tact Language is for TON)

Alex: Actually from definition of SendParameters,  it's not necessary to declare mode = 0: struct SendParameters {     bounce: Bool = true;     to: Address;     value: Int;     mode: Int = 0;     body: Cell? = null;     code: Cell? = null;     data: Cell? = null; }  About your result, maybe need to create separate contract to check sending message with mode=0. I think it will work fine. (reply to 1524)

Howard: Thanks Alex!

Eugene: There is a small typo that might confuse someone on the new docs website ‚Äî missing "r" in "yarn"  I wanted to send a pull request to fix that, but the docs I see on GitHub differ from the docs I see on the new website, why is that? (reply to 1525)

Andrew: docs are located in this repo: https://github.com/ton-community/tact-docs (reply to 1530)

Howard: anyone building the project in latest test library tho? I am not TS expert but learning on it ü§£   Otherwise I can only test the contract in test-net manually, it is not reliable for edge cases I think.

Howard: How we can trouble shooting the error happened with ErrorCode5?   Since it "sometimes" shows up in my contract......

Maksim: receive(num: String) {         let rand: String = random(1, 2).toString();         if (rand == num)  Invalid type "String" for binary operator "==" how should i check strings for equality?

Chris: Where can i find lang support for vs?

‚Äî 2023-01-22 ‚Äî

Howard: Put it as Slice data type first. The do the comparison.   Or put String to Cell, by using ‚ÄúText‚Äù.asComment() (reply to 1542)

Un gars bien: Got answers to this? Would like to know also. (reply to 1499)

Maksim: i tied to defince num_cell and rand_cell like: let num_cell: Cell = num.asComment(); and compare them but it makes the error too

Howard: if you want to do the comparison in Int, why don't you using Int still? (reply to 1549)

Alex: I think for Cell, Slice we should use hash() function to compare them(inherits from FunC). But, I‚Äôm not sure about the idea of how it should work in Tact.

Howard: Checking in test-library, should we write the  export ourself for test initially??

Maksim: cause i want to recieve a number and compare it to random numberüòÅ and there is no String.toInt() method (reply to 1550)

Maksim: wow this worked, thanks! (reply to 1551)

Alex: export is ordinary js/ts keyword for modules. You can include(import) functions you need from another module, files in this way. (reply to 1552)

Maksim: i have one more question: why when i run contract.deploy.ts for several times for the same contract it generates the same address for the contract? shouldn't address be new every time i run contract.deploy.ts?

Howard: nah, I mean those modules in contract folders in contract https://github.com/ton-community/sandbox/tree/main/examples/contracts  are the export modules that we should write ourself? To define the script we want to test, right? (reply to 1555)

Alex: It depends on what you declared in contract.deploy.ts.  The address will not change if you have no unique updated data in init() function. (reply to 1556)

Alex: I‚Äôm trying to deploy jetton.contract, placed in this project.  Got this error output when running yarn deploy :   $ ts-node sources/jetton.deploy.ts /Users/alexg/Dev/tact-jetton/node_modules/ts-node/src/index.ts:859     return new TSError(diagnosticText, diagnosticCodes, diagnostics);            ^ TSError: ‚®Ø Unable to compile TypeScript: sources/output/jetton_SampleJetton.ts:771:105 - error TS2339: Property 'vmLogs' does not exist on type '{ success: true; gasUsed: bigint; stack: TupleReader; exitCode: number; }'.  771             throw new ComputeError(SampleJetton_errors[res.exitCode].message, res.exitCode, { logs: res.vmLogs });  @steve_kite can You suggest how to solve this issue?

Maksim: @howard_peng are there templates for standard contracts like NFT, wallets, jettons, etc?

Lev: There's Howard's NFT implementation: https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-standard-tact (reply to 1560)

Lev: Didn't see jettons, vaguely remember seeing wallets

Howard: Jetton, Yes.   NFT standard, No!   I still can't figure out the String data type store in Collection/NFT Item..... (reply to 1560)

Howard: can take a reference for Jetton implementation from: https://github.com/ton-community/tact/blob/main/examples/jetton.tact

Maksim: so how should i create a message that contract will recognize as a message of a specific type? (reply to 1564)

Howard: you can check the TS file located in output folder

Howard: Tact libraries will generate for every Contracts by each

Chris: did anybody start create extension for vs code?

Alex: Yes, I saw footstep in progress. But didn‚Äôt see for JetBrains. (reply to 1569)

‚Äî 2023-01-23 ‚Äî

Howard: Hi all, has anyone tried to implement the TypeScript (TS) file we got after compiling in the SandBox?  Like this line it was routed from the contracts folder that we wrote previously.  I think what he did is exactly what we have already in the output folder.

Howard: I think Tact compiler can integrate it by just change a bit for output file?Then everyone can benefit from that without rewriting modules for test themself again and again.

Howard: Example, I think there has something similar part we can use:  Left: My new module for test libraries - SandBox  Right: The output TS file from Tact - by @Steve_kite

Alex: @steve_kite Is it possible to solve this issue currently, or does something need to do with ton-tact library? (reply to 1559)

Steve: tact works just fine, ask questions to sandbox people

Steve: you won't be able to write "classes for testing" by yourself

Alex: What about jetton.tact, is it possible to deploy current jetton.tact contract? (reply to 1577)

Steve: Tact VS Code Plugin  Official Tact Plugin: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ton-community.tact-vscode  We decided to use a pink unicorn for file icons ü¶Ñ (forwarded from TON Development News)

Steve: should be able to, but haven't tested it yet (reply to 1579)

Kon: How about footstep progress then? Double work... (reply to 1580)

Steve: Zero people contacted me about vs code plugin

Kon: If footstep is approved, what is the reason to contact?

Steve: I have approved nothing, I recommend you to contact whatever is doing so

Kon: From now assume that footstep is disapproved by you or we will continue own development process?

Steve: I am do not know anything about footsteps

Kon: Here (reply to 1570)

Kon: Have we any reason to do the same work?

Steve: I created a grammar since I needed it for docs, once I finished it we packed an extension too

Steve: Reason? Nothing existed when we started

Kirill: It is good that we have a functioning extension

Kon: We need to decide who will continue at all, we have footstep and repo with your project in the ton-community

Kon: We have planned to publish our release in 1-2 weeks, as it was described in the footstep, for now we don't know continue or not our progress...

Kon: The problem that it is not all that was planned in footstep (reply to 1592)

Andrew: I wonder if ton society moderators can handle this

Kirill: If Footstep was approved it will be payed out for

Kirill: maybe some existing code can be reused in the work on the Footstep according to the licensing

Kon: We can try to merge in the ton-community repository, but we need to be sure that we can continue and don't do the double work... Because it is no the reason to spend time on the same task...

‚Äî 2023-01-24 ‚Äî

Howard: Do you mean Tact can work with its test libraries, which works fine without the need to use Sandbox? (reply to 1577)

Howard: need more support with test libraries, I can't understand the difference for using Jest or Sandbox

Howard: from contract testing safely, what should we do? Just want a easier way to write the test cases.

Daniil: Sandbox is for working with smart contracts, and jest (or mocha) is just a general testing library (reply to 1601)

Steve: What can be easier than auto generated snapshot testing?

Howard: Sorry, more clarification. What should I do for multi-calling?   My structure is that the one receive method in contract A will call to a second contract. And for now, it doesn't show on the Snapshot area.  It would be great if you could share the test cases in Jetton Standard b/c it us a mutil contact structure as well. (reply to 1604)

Steve: So, just create a second tracker?

Howard: What I mean is for the big project that will bind the call methods to create the new contract like NFT Collection -> NFT Item contract.   1/ [Red square] if I build the new It statement, the variable of owner will change in a new one.   How to keep the single address as owner and keep the authority all the time.   2/ [Orange square] the first contract's "New" statement will pass the message to my UserRecord contract(the second one); I will need to keep the parameters and status to track contract 1&2's reactions.   Since I will get the reply message from Contract 2 sending to contract 1.   My question is, how can we track those series of messages trigged by this Tx?  ContractA: receive(A) ‚Äî calling to --> ContractB: receive(the A plus)  ‚Äî calling to ‚Äî> ContractA: receive("any feedback message")    3/ How we fetch the balance of the contract all the time(like monitoring each Txs cost, and the remaining balance for an address)   Since I always tested in production test net, now I am facing the issue that the contract might fail ‚Äúat some times‚Äù but works successfully by chance. (Yes, the opCode is the same, but the result might be failed based on different sizes of TON) This is why I am researching how to write proper test cases.

Alex: Can anybody else try to deploy jetton.tact. I'm not sure we have problem in Tact compiler, but really stuck with this issue. (reply to 1581)

Andrew: Hello, just trying to use storeSlice according to docs https://docs.tact-lang.org/reference/cells#builderstoreslice  How I expect it should work (case 1):   let message: Cell = beginCell().storeSlice(msg).endCell();   Actual result:    Error: Line 28, col 33:   27 |             let to: Address = self.owner; > 28 |             let message: Cell = beginCell().storeSlice(msg).endCell();                                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   29 |  Type "Builder" does not have a function named "storeSlice"   How it works instead:  let builder: Builder = beginCell(); builder = storeSlice(builder, msg); let message: Cell = endCell(builder);   Is it expected behavior in case 1 or what I‚Äôm doing wrong? maybe it's a bug  e.g. msg.asCell() works as expected.

Steve: this would be updated in next release, but i am advising against using builders at all

Andrew: why are you advising that? What's the issue with builders? (reply to 1611)

Steve: Because it is error prone and better to use automated solutions

Andrew: what the best way to write next code in Tact?    cell msg_body_cell = begin_cell().store_slice(in_msg_body).end_cell();   var msg = begin_cell()     .store_uint(0x10, 6)     .store_slice(owner_address)     .store_coins(0)     .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)     .store_slice(sender_address)     .store_ref(msg_body_cell)     .end_cell();   send_raw_message(msg, 64);   I rewrote it like this, based on this example https://docs.tact-lang.org/guides/send#send-typed-message   struct Responce {     sender: Address;     msg: Slice; }   send(SendParameters{                 to: to,                 value: 0,                  mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors,                  bounce: true,                  body: Responce{sender: ctx.sender, msg: msg}.asCell()             });   However getting the same error:    Error: Line 34, col 23:   33 |                 bounce: true,  > 34 |                 body: Responce{sender: ctx.sender, msg: msg}.asCell()                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   35 |             }); Type "Responce" does not have a function named "asCell"   How to convert struct to Cell any other way? (reply to 1611)

Steve: It is toCell, since it is not a cast but a costly operation

Daniil: Oh, so there is actually this thing üò≥ Nice

Steve: Btw there are an example wallet-opt that do some mangling of slices that could work for you, but I recommend not to play around with cryptic code with slices, but just use structs and messages

Howard: new Docs website is legit

Howard: I am building a notification for users who win a prize. However, there is a limitation for single transaction cost in TVM (1 TON).

Maksim: what‚Äôs the problem they tagged SPAM? it‚Äôs just a tag in tonkeeper, but your txs fulfill their purpose: they inform usersüòÅ

Maksim: the only problem i see is that scammers can send same notifications to users with the wrong website like ‚Äúyou win! come to scammer.ton to claim your reward‚Äù and steal users funds

Herm√®s: But I need it because I am coding in Tact. Maybe will have better practice in standard libraries by Steve. (reply to 1686)

Herm√®s: and Log by the way. I am testing in my own way to achieve it. But seems not safety enough.

Herm√®s: ü¶Ñ

Andrew: this makes me think - would it be beneficial to have an inline func in tact, in analogy to c++ inline assembly? (reply to 1687)

Alex: Has somebody else noticed new build issues with the last Tact 0.8.10?  Tact compilation failed Error: Line 40, col 17:   39 |             send(SendParameters{ > 40 |                 to: msg.responseAddress,                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   41 |                 value: 0, Invalid type "Address?" for fields "to" with type Address in type SendParameters

Howard: You can't put ‚ÄòAddress?‚Äô data type in there. Need adding as ‚ÄòYour Address!!‚Äô

Alex: This error appears because the new type checker does not allow Address? for send function. Type of msg.responseAddress inherits from the definition of messages for jettons in @stdlib/jetton  What do you think, Should I create an additional variable, that will have a strict Address type and read there before using it as to parameter of send() function?

Alex: I see now, I meant to add !! operator. Thank you, fixed. (reply to 1702)

Howard: What is the usage for ‚Äònow()‚Äô with logical time?    What is the time frame for 1hr, 24hour or 7days?

Seitaro: logical time is not in any way bound to unix timestamp (or "real" time), LT is merely way of ordering entities on TON (entity with lower LT can not depend on entity with higher LT) (reply to 1705)

Howard: https://docs.tact-lang.org/reference/common#now

Howard: How can I adding it if I want to set a duration for 24hr

Seitaro: now() returns unixtimestamp, but you asked about "logical time" in your question (reply to 1709)

Seitaro: cur_lt() returns logical time and there is no strict correlation between span in "real time" and span in "logical time"

Andrew: how to iterate on map keys and remove some?

Howard: adding in map is like  ->  self.map.set(value1, value2) (reply to 1712)

Andrew: but how to remove data? (reply to 1713)

Howard: I usually just put a new value in value2 to overwrite it. (reply to 1713)

Andrew: also guess it is possible to overwrite whole map with new map like this self.map = newmap;   How do you iterate on map without knowing keys? I need to remove some obsolete keys on request the value by which they need to be deleted stores in value2 (reply to 1715)

Andrew: Can any one explain on example what !! operator do? I don‚Äôt understand   > !! suffix operator - enforce non-null value, defined only for nullable types.

Howard: force the value being have the value in my cases ‚úÖ (reply to 1718)

Andrew: so what will be difference if I return .get(address) without !! in else case? (reply to 1720)

Howard: maybe get null? for my cases, I don't want that happend

Lev: I think it would be a different type

Lev: A nullable type vs Int

Andrew: But you checked in if case for null and return 0.   So it is imposible to return null in else case and then question even if I return enforced value with !! where does this value come from? (reply to 1722)

Lev: Even if you checked for null using an if, it will be of type Int? (reply to 1725)

Lev: And it should be just Int

Andrew: so if write the same code as Howard sent but without !! return type of the function witll be Int? (reply to 1724)

Lev: Yes, probably

Andrew: got it, thanks

Howard: Using standard trait like Stoppable can save the gas or just for safety purpose?

Andrew: Is it possible to convert Slice to struct type?

Andrew: It just throw error on any receivers where requireNotStopped() was called and stoped = true. To set stoped neeed to send message with "Stop‚Äù.  Code here https://github.com/ton-core/tact/blob/cddf370adcce09c920da51ab06614d736c79c40a/stdlib/libs/stoppable.tact (reply to 1731)

Andrew: Has anyone encountered the problem of comparing two numbers?   Code in tact:    let a: Int = 1;  let b:int = 2;  let c:int = -1;  if(a == b) { // do smtg }    Generated code in func:   int $a = 1; int $b = 2; int $c = (-1)    if (($a == $b)) {     }   Leads to an transaction error  9 ‚ÄúCell underflow‚Äù.   I suppose generated code should looks like:   int $a = 1; int $b = 2; int $c = -1   if ($a == $b) {     }

‚Äî 2023-01-28 ‚Äî

Howard: this is a great question. But since I think most of people learned the Tact wouldn't be able to write in FunC. (reply to 1735)

Howard: But then your error code might not have occurred because the format of FunC files looks different. Maybe you need to debug by looking at your full .tact file first. (reply to 1735)

Howard: what is the loadTupleXXXXX and storeTupleXXXXX usage for our output modules in TS?

Andrew: Yep, the problem was something else. I haven‚Äôt figured it out yet, but looks like it‚Äôs because I compare int and uint (reply to 1737)

Howard: What is the difference for & or || here means in TLB Shcema.  Same as TEP62 for NFT standard. Some using & some use ||   I followed the code they defined to claim previously. But I am thinking this is not correct at this moment on my Tact code.

Howard: ü´•ü´† why it is on the first

Howard: I can't believe the meta.json string is on the prefix üòÇ

Howard: hey guys, I solve this!

Howard: by putting the String data type combine, you have using StringBuilder to convert to Slice data type first...!

Alex: Added tact.jetton demo project with deployment. Example of deployed contract - here. Created from the original jetton.tact example without significant changes, but added ‚Äú!!‚Äù operator.

Howard: so what will it makes differences in Tact code? (reply to 1751)

Howard: Got this error since I tried to test in my Transfer method in second time after I mint the NFT Item. ExitCode9 usually means my Tact code is not correct tho?

Daniil: These are for calculating the opcode tags (reply to 1759)

Daniil: You should just use the results

Howard: Thanks Daniil! I am trying my logic in Transfer that, since my NFT still can't trigged the Transfer method through TonKeeper. (reply to 1762)

Howard: Here is my code, the initial Transfer that trigged by minting process is fine. It can shows on my wallet.  But error code:9 pop at second timing transfer, which is known as  msg.forward_amount > 0 situation.   (the line of code I highlighted)

Howard: but since the error code is only pop with 9: Cell underflow, and it just out of my knowledge to debugging or change any side of the code. I checked with Jetton template already.    Need any other suggestion to find the way out (reply to 1764)

Howard: except with TonKeeper, where can I trigge the Transfer method on website tho?

Howard: thinking maybe the parameters that TonKeeper passed is not on the TEP62.   That is why the receive method I prepared was not matched and always cause Cell underflow ExitCode 9 (reply to 1764)

Andrew: check tonkeeper's sources to figure out the parameters it sends (reply to 1768)

Howard: Ohhhh. Good advice. Thanks.  But any else I can able to transfer NFTs? TonHub seems didn‚Äôt support showing NFTs. (reply to 1769)

Herm√®s: how can we make sure the SmartContract Notification will not be tag as a SPAM on TonKeeper?

Alex: Steve wrote early. This means - it's bad behavior for your dApp, smart contract. What for you want use it?  But generally, in case of Tonkeeper it depends on their rules. Value of amount and perhaps exceptions for some TON addresses.

Herm√®s: it's just a message to remind the users what status they got

Alex: Why do they need this notification? Can you implement this feature with get methods and show this on request from the user?   For example, in this way wallet's balance displays to the user, and we have no messages-notifies on balance update events.

‚Äî 2023-02-01 ‚Äî

Herm√®s: Sounds perfect, but with get functions means? Since my logic is that "One wallet can register with multiple-times"  And I think sending message is one way to improve the UX. Maybe there has better solutions. (reply to 1787)

Howard: Hi all, I am passing a "Full mapping" into a new contract.   There wasn't any error during the compile, but once I execute the Tx, it will get a Type Check Error message.  Exit Code 7

Howard: Since the example has the same syntax, I was just wondering if it is safe and functional. Because my mapping might be very large.  cc @steve_kite (reply to 1797)

Howard: and I am still working on this.... LFG LFG.... (reply to 1773)

Alex: But what is the idea? I'm using TON wallet for year and looked into transaction history a few times. Much more reason for me was that I tested wallets. And I believe, that most part of users just want to swipe off transaction's push notify(if it's not about the incoming huge amountsüëÄü§©) and almost never look at their transaction's history.  Please, note, that I have practical experience only in realizing smart contracts for learning purposes and never realized my own product for TON.  From what I know about classic development, I see following ways:  1) To make own Web client(mobile/desktop). That will display your contract's with UI you want. Something like a blockchain explorer adapted to your contract and viewing that's content according to your idea.  2) To create something like(or exactly the same) NFT item. Users can see this on their wallets from blockchain explorers and some wallets. You can try to implement your updates via NFT-editable.  For example, GetGem's Easter eggs event was implemented with NFT. I tested it, and I've never got any notifications in the blockchain. But I have a lot in the telegram bot or in their marketplace. Another thing is that I could open my wallet when I wanted and check the "status" of my egg.  That's what I meant, hope it looks more clear for now. (reply to 1796)

Alex: Is it possible to exclude maps from your solution? Large maps + Tact really looks like double trouble currently. It really useful for Tact improvement in general, I think..üåù However, I would prefer to begin from the solution without maps and use an address mechanic similar to how it works in the calculation for messages' destination for jetton wallets. (reply to 1798)

Howard: do you have example for use an address mechanic similar to how it works in the calculation for messages' destination for jetton wallets?   The only way I think possible is writing a for loop read each line of data in the mapping. But again, it is not reliable since the gas cost is not predictable, which means your Tx might failed in a sudden the bounced. (reply to 1801)

Alex: Briefly idea with good explanation in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEO29KmOpv4&t=309s  And more accurate, here. (reply to 1802)

Alex: Every time you realize that you need a big loop for your infinity-long list in the TON monolith-service-like contract - something went wrongüôÇ. (reply to 1802)

Howard: Got it. Like one NFT Item is one contract. Because creating a contract is cheap in TON (reply to 1803)

Alex: Not only because of cost, but also because it will not create a bottle-neck for your service in your contract. (reply to 1805)

Howard: and data accuracy/usability right, I remember.

Steve: I just published a small roadmap: https://github.com/ton-core/tact/blob/main/ROADMAP.md  I am welcome to hear what you are missing

Steve: I just added importing func code, that could help you writing something in plain func and keep working mostly in Tact. For example, you can create a jetton/nft content cell as you wish.

Steve: Tact v0.9.0  This release is significantly improves gas usage and compatibility with func by allowing importing func files into your Tact contract!  This line would append contents of this file to the begining of Tact-generated file:  import "./native.fc";  Then you can declare native functions in tact that uses your func code.  Some caveats: func imports are not supported, order of imports are not guaranteed, func syntax is not verified (this could lead to cryptic errors), type safety is reduced and you have to be careful with declaring native functions in tact.  https://github.com/ton-core/tact/releases/tag/v0.9.0 (forwarded from TON Development News)

Howard: Followed the article, it shows Internal Message Tx support with different message bodies, then why kind of condition will make Exit Code 9 usually? (reply to 1760)

‚Äî 2023-02-02 ‚Äî

Alex: Only reason of Exit code 9 - Your contract triyng to read bits or reference, but there was not any data. (reply to 1815)

Howard: hmmmmm got it

Howard: Hi everyone! I just fixed the issue for the previous version of the NFT standard in Tact. Now, you can successfully mint NFT Collections with NFT Items, since after you get the NFT Item in your wallet, you can transfer it through TonKeeper smoothly! üí™üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è  https://github.com/howardpen9/tact-nft-standard  - There are example URIs for the image content, so you can change it to whatever you need! It's an off-chain content following the TEP64 metadata.  - For the minting process, you need to know that the is_initialized field is defined when the contract is deployed. Once the Item is being minted, it should change to true. (TEP-62)  - The Royalties Fee part has also been successfully implemented following TEP-66; it is now set to a default of 35% in the deploy.ts file. You can change it to whatever you want.

Steve: There is fun createOffchainContent(link: String): Cell in @stdlib/content now, no need to do this hacks for content link

Steve: Just added an ability to collect logs from contracts

Steve: TON Emulator v2.0.0  Added: * Ability to track VM logs of any contract  Breaking changes: * Tracker now returns transactions, instead events * events() renamed to collect()  https://github.com/ton-core/ton-emulator/releases/tag/v2.0.0 (forwarded from TON Development News)

Alex: Can you clarify, if it is some special idea to exist these various output files? Especially, interesting, how developers can use *.abi and *.md files?  For example, abi, as I understand it, is something Etherium legacy approach. I want to get a general idea directly for TON clear,  to understand what I can tell to newcomers about this(instead redirect them to the Ethereum source).

Lev: *.md ‚Äî the documentation, *.abi describes the interface of the smart contract (operators, getters, types)

Alex: Thank you, but question - how developers can use it on practice? Where from they should to know this? What for these operators, getters, types generates?  I need little bit more detailed example of using.

Lev: I think you can just guess the format from the file ‚Äî depends on what you want to do with it. There's a type called ContractABI, you can look at it, too

Steve: Proposal for formal ABI format was rejected, currently its format is defined only by Tact project. It is used to generate bindings and you can use it to generate UI for contract.

Kon: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/108 is this, right? TLB then? (reply to 1826)

Kon: Just your idea to use ABI for UI generation really useful...

Steve: You can do it now, tact even have tools to generate bindings for non-tact contracts and tact self-report it‚Äôs abi via get method and ipfs link

Howard: what will happend if we set a op code in 0x1 for example?  For most of cases, we don't need to set the code of it. (In here, we need to follow the TEP62)   1/ Does the length of opCode here is having the limitation?  2/ What will happened if we set with 0x1 or 0x00000001 (8 digits)

Steve: It is uint32

Alex: Maybe my thoughts will be helpful:  I saw two cases in general in FunC contracts: 1) Messages bounced back if it something not expected by contract with funds - fees value. It's good practice and user friendly. 2) Messages just deliver to the destination contract, and then contract won't do any actions.  I'm not sure, what the current logic for the Tact compiler in general, but when I sent in testnet something unexpected by recievers it's just bounced back. It look like, all messages(op-codes) we not expected with receivers bounced.  And you can try send any opcode via ton library.  here not the bestüòÖ example of how to put opcode in Cell msg:   //TL-B mint#01fb345b amount:int257 = Mint     let msg = beginCell().storeBuffer(Buffer.from("01fb345b", "hex")).storeInt(amount, 257).endCell(); (reply to 1836)

Steve: tact by default bounces unknown messages, but there is a receiver bounced(msg: Slice) that allow to handle bounced messages

Howard: yeh, it works. Even 0x1 is works in Message, as Steve mentioned, it's just a uint32.   In theory you can set what ever you want, if your receive method is not against with any TEP I think.   (forget the error code...

Lev: I feel like maps are under-documented: they're not mentioned in the standard library article Like, for instance, how do I create an empty map?

Steve: You just declare it

Steve: It is confusing but i don‚Äôt know a better way. On func level empty map is just null.

Lev: In a contract initially yes, but I need to set it to an empty map afterwards (reply to 1844)

Steve: Hm, should add clear method then. Please, file an issue

Steve: Btw right now you can declare local variable of a map and then assign it to a contract one

Lev: How do I declare it?

Steve: With maps the biggest issue is that you can‚Äôt iterate. While it is quite expensive operation that could lead you to out of gas situations, it is still needed sometimes.

Steve: let newMap:map[‚Ä¶]‚Ä¶; (reply to 1849)

Steve: You can also compare maps for equality! oldMap == newMap

Steve: But this need investigation, I am not sure if it could return false-negative results

Steve: File an issue

Lev: Done üëå

Steve: Will fix once I get time

Steve: Actually i have fixed it: https://github.com/ton-core/tact/releases/tag/v0.9.2

Lev: Ah, thanks!

Howard: From a security perspective, does that mean that "if I don't share my .tact file, no one can find bugs in my code?"  - The .ts file helps us interact with the smart contract without getting our hands dirty, as it is generated from the compiled output. It's not possible to reverse engineer the original logic of the code, similar to the .byte code in Solidity.  - To ensure that the receive method is not being called by anyone, it is correct to add as many require statements as possible. However, this may increase gas costs. I am currently unable to determine the difference as I have only tested on the test-net.

Andrew: reverse engineer always wins, it's important to keep that in mind (reply to 1863)

Herm√®s: from my understand, we can implement PaymentChannel in Tact as well right? Since it is interacting based on Signatures

Steve: Yes but payment channels are basically useless.

Daniil: Payments channels in ton is just a standard, so you can implement it in any language you want (that works on TVM) (reply to 1870)

Steve: It could only useful for some use cases where user is going to spend a lot small amounts of coins. I can‚Äôt make up a good example

Steve: Also you can‚Äôt withdraw anything until channel destroyed

Daniil: Why? It's similar to bitcoin lightning network which is pretty popular and used by a lot of people (reply to 1871)

Steve: Bitcoin has 20min transaction time, ~1$ fees

Steve: Ton is fast and cheap

Daniil: Not that cheap if you want to perform a lot of transactions

Steve: Yes but why?

Kirill: What application of the bitcoin lightning network have you personally used in the last 3 months? (reply to 1875)

Steve: I know one use case - marketplace arbitrage

Steve: But cexes doesn‚Äôt support now and you still need to withdraw from time to time

Seitaro: It is not standardized, btw (reply to 1872)

Daniil: I don't use Bitcoin at all (reply to 1880)

Daniil: Another example can be gambling app which processes all bets through the payment channel so that user can't get his withdrawal declined (reply to 1881)

Steve: No, it won‚Äôt work

Andrew: Ads? (reply to 1873)

Daniil: Hm? The owner of such app can only scam user on his last bet, not the whole balance (reply to 1886)

Steve: You need each user to setup a payment channel which has more gas cost than simple transfer

Steve: You can check tonbet in my github

Steve: It scales infinitely

Daniil: Each user may just deploy a single contract on registration (reply to 1889)

Daniil: I saw it (reply to 1890)

Steve: No need for payment channels here

Steve: Payment channels are useful if there are 10+ payments at least

Daniil: I don't think people who gamble would just make a few bets in casino and leave (reply to 1895)

Steve: You also need a wallet support (reply to 1896)

Steve: Btw

Lev: What about stuff like TON Proxy? You pay continuously as you use it, so it makes sense

Steve: Yes. But this is not a working feature in practice right now. (reply to 1899)

Herm√®s: interesting. Love to try out. (reply to 1873)

Herm√®s: Pop in my head might be IoT: like your toilet will upload every time to click the button. It's a minimum cost for uploading a original data.   And maybe it can receive the funds as well. Because the users might be able to earn the reward if they use the service. X-to-Earn.

Herm√®s: but yeh, early stage will keep thinking. Since Bitcoin lightning network is not Smart contract based right?

Steve: Sure but payment channels right now expect a deposit before opening a channel. It is not like just magical no fee transactions

Lev: When can TVM exit code 7 (Type check error. An argument to a primitive is of an incorrect value type) appear?

Seitaro: https://ton.org/docs/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-exit-codes > If you encounter such exception in a func contract it probably means a type error in asm declarations. (reply to 1906)

Lev: I saw it, I mean in Tact

Seitaro: Sorry, missed chat topic. (reply to 1908)

Steve: do you have an idea where it could be? get method? (reply to 1906)

Steve: receiver?

Steve: may be incorrect message?

Lev: This one could be (reply to 1912)

Lev: One of these

Steve: you can try to emulate it in ton-emulator/sandbox and see logs

Steve: Try to check that you have inited all variables in init method

Howard: can we have a tutorial for how to debug in logs? (reply to 1916)

Steve: You can find some examples in ton-emulator repo

Sergei: I think about an implementation of order book exchange based on payment channels. But the current implementation is not suitable for this. At least we need payment channels for Jettons (reply to 1895)

Steve: I recommend to just implement everything from scratch on the same principles

Steve: @howard_peng why no? (reply to 1900)

Lev: Btw why do you want to do it? Are you introducing type variables/generics?

Steve: I need to use syntax like ‚ÄúInt as uint32‚Äù. And also future path to generics.

Lev: How do I parse a struct from its Cell representation?

Howard: from its Cell representation? (reply to 1927)

Lev: Structs are serialized into cells, I want to deserialize

Lev: Well I guess deserializing maps would be enough

Steve: Manual parsing is not implemented yet, what‚Äôs use case?

Lev: Wanted to store data in one field for multiple use cases But I can do it without manual parsing, it's ok

Lev: Btw rusty enums would be really cool

Howard: hi, seems my friend will get error when reading in my Tact repo. He got this error in Address library that from ton.   Seems the issued from the package?

Step: Do you know how to get stateinit  from new ton library that i can pass to tonweb's transfer? (reply to 1953)

Howard:     let seqno: number = await wallet_address.getSeqno();     let transfer = await wallet_address.sendTransfer({         seqno: seqno,         secretKey: keyPair.secretKey,         messages: [             internal({                 value: toNano("0.5"),                 to: contract_address,                 init: { code: init.code, data: init.data },                 bounce: true,                 body: packed, // TDODO             }),         ],     }); (reply to 1956)

Step: I am asking stateinit for tonweb library (reply to 1957)

Alex: Did he try use it with very last versions of libraries? (reply to 1955)

Alex: Sounds really unclear. Do you want to use ton and tonweb in one project? Is it Tact lang project? (reply to 1958)

Step: yes i want to use ton and tonweb in one project (reply to 1960)

Alex: It is bad idea, you shouldn't use both of them in one project.  If you tell more about your current issue somebody can help you use one library for all features in project. (reply to 1962)

Step: the days i was working on it, ton js was also updated and broken everything. then i managed to get it working by combining both.  now ton updated stateinit removed now broken again. (reply to 1963)

Alex: StateInit is a function that tact compiler creates for you in output file contract.ts (reply to 1964)

Alex: What is init function in your .tact currently?

Step: sorry its not a tact project. üòÖ funcjs and ton js

Alex: So, I think you should ask help in general ton dev chat for this case.

Howard: üòπ (reply to 1955)

Maksim: where should i specify individual content link for nft? (reply to 1818)

Alex: Currently, it is only on-chain  content implemented. Defined via  hardcode in the deployment script .deploy.ts. (reply to 1985)

Maksim: there is a link in deploy.ts https://s.getgems.io/nft-staging/c/628f6ab8077060a7a8d52d63/ but for each nft {nft_index}.json adds to this link. so where we define this {nft_index}.json? (reply to 1986)

Maksim: i guess here?

Alex: It's implementation of reading.  Content creates in this snippet. + Part of the implementation for the generation nft_item's content is placed in NFTitem init() function. @howard_peng (reply to 1988)

Maksim: but when we mint nft we just send to the contract ‚ÄúMint‚Äù comment and don‚Äôt specify content for nft. so how it creates? (reply to 1989)

Maksim: i mean we have basic link for collection which we define in deploy.ts but where we define nft individual content suffix

Alex: Ah, sorry, I said it on-chain. I was wrong.üôà (reply to 1986)

Alex: Yeah, this place really tricky for me. 1) "Mint" message Invokes mint() function  2) mint() invokes init() for creating data for new NFTItem here  2) init() use getter getNftItemInit() for creating Individual content here 3) getNftItemInit() invokes get_nfr_data() individual content from here. (reply to 1991)

Alex: So, it is true, that individual NFTitem content is built here. (reply to 1987)

Maksim: so it builds in get_nft_data()? (reply to 1994)

Maksim: and one more question how do i form cutom messages like this

Alex: As I know Howard tested it with Tonkeeper. Do you want to create such a transaction via code?

Maksim: yeah (reply to 1997)

Maksim: so how i create transactions when we have custom messages receivers

Howard: I just followed the index_id as a parameters, to follow the metadata URL want to implement. (reply to 1993)

Alex: I have no ready-made example for NFT transfer, trying to find an example. I did several custom messages for my demo projects with ton library. Which library do you want to use? (reply to 1999)

Howard: Good question! In fact, I tested it out and enable to put as a input that your users can put.    For example, maybe it could be text message or the ID in the game, so it could plug-inon-chain rather than on the Metadata level(in JSON).   That's why we keep custom_playload with question marks. (reply to 1996)

Howard: I haven't tried out this yet. But good to try. (reply to 1999)

Howard: Yes. I only test it out on TonKeeper for transfer.

Maksim: it‚Äôs not really matter you can send any example) (reply to 2001)

Maksim: so individual content suffix builds only in get_nft_data()? (reply to 2000)

Alex: Ok, give me some time, I will try send from Howard's repo and add there if I get success.

Howard: Yeh. But you can change it for sure. If your NFT content in metadata is not followed the index_id (reply to 2006)

Alex: Need check, do you have any testnet wallet address for sending NFT? (reply to 2005)

Alex: As I understand, your NFT items have no store toncoins for itself, doesn‚Äôt it? (reply to 2008)

Alex: https://github.com/howardpen9/tact-nft-standard/pull/1 added Example of transfer via ton here

Maksim: thank you so much (reply to 2011)

Howard: Just back to home after the Hack-a-TonX! Thanks Alex. (reply to 2011)

‚Äî 2023-02-13 ‚Äî

Howard: Try to read a bit in the FunC file I got in my output folder, since I had install the syntax for FunC, seems there has some potential error in there?   How can we solve this, should I worried about the FunC code I got after compiled?

Daniil: These are problems with syntax highlighting extension (reply to 2014)

Daniil: I also saw some troubles with func comments on the docs page

Howard: I encountered a similar issue when I implemented the NFT standard. It's possible that the message structure you set is not consistent with the message you are sending from your client-side.  For instance, I encountered an error when I attempted to transfer the NFT on TonKeeper after I minted it.  That's why I had to deploy the contract and test it in production, checking and adding more 'if' cases to account for scenarios such as what would happen if the "forwardPayload" was empty or zero.

Alex: Yes, it is about duplication this list in md.  I saw numbers of questions about "what 135 exit code mean?", so for some people, it isn't obvious how to find out their meaning.(I want add little description about reading exit codes in tact docs) Also for the complex contract(with includes from other tact libs) it could very big ABI. I think in these cases it is more convenient for reading exit codes from .md. (reply to 2023)

Howard: ü´°ü´°ü´° (reply to 1945)

Howard: LFG LFG

Howard: I tried it out, but Tx pause at number 5. No error, no out of gas. It just no execute the Tx it supposed to do.

Seitaro: There are no restrictions on chain length/depth (reply to 2039)

Seitaro: Moreover message does not contain any info on it's "depth in call stack", so transactions caused by "new message just from wallet" and caused by "result of chain of hundred transactions" will be the same.

Daniil: Are you sure the message body is formed correctly? Maybe there's problem with your "Contract second"? (reply to 2040)

Howard: Shouldn't be. Because contract can compile success.   Let me try out with combining Contract Second and  SubContract first. Thanks. (reply to 2043)

Howard: OK, I made mistake, I didn't notice I typed in the incorrect name in subContract.    let contract_init: StateInit = initOf SubContractName(PARAMETER1, PARAMETER2);   Want to point it out that, even the non-exist Contract Name in your code with "contractAddress(contract_init)", you still can compile your Tact code successfully.

Seitaro: Oh, I get it, it is uint32(-14)

Howard: Never use this before. Is this part of Tact? (reply to 2063)

Herm√®s: can we compare the value in key of the mapping  and do the comparison?

Herm√®s: Like here, the first Int is the key of the mapping.   Or is there any way to store values in smart contract and compared with it

Alex: If values are slice_data, as I saw in FunC, it is compered via hash functions. Also we can do something like store owner's address(any data) in contract and check it with require() statement here. (reply to 2067)

Alex: I think you should avoid maps in the current version of the Tact compiler. You can share your task to find a better way to implement your logic without a maps(dicts).

Kon: you can compare hash. Convert the value to slice and then apply .hash() - for example for string it will work... but if have Int - you can use math expressions even, what is the problem? You can compare: let a: Int = 1; let b: Int = 2; if (a != b) { ... } If you mean the question how to pass through the map, then use index for map length + loop, then into loop use map.get(key) and compare (reply to 2067)

Herm√®s: loop is a big issed I think. But I think I will take a look in hash().

Howard: any possible we can upgrade the contract code before the Roadmap Ch 3?

Kon: I assume that you can create code on funC and run in from tact (reply to 2072)

Andrew: https://ton.org/docs/develop/func/stdlib/#set_code  Using native wrapper to call it from tact (reply to 2072)

Howard: Yeh, same as my idea, but will like to see what potential error or what should I notice if I doing so.

Howard: - The previous contract status will move to new one? - How to migrate the original data in previous move to new one if I adding more storage spaces?

Howard: ok, I will learn more in FunC now üòÇ

Kon: I think that you can store the data in somewhere else in this case... I mean that you can create a new smart contract, store there and then migrate the data, for example. I saw only examples where the data is wiped and code upgraded...

Howard: I think we need a serious example about this way(if this is a solution), since we plan to deploy the Tact code in production. (reply to 2074)

Howard: If the project can't be upgrade, then it will limit the scalability of the project that code in Tact.

Kon: you can create proxy smart contract , load to there code and then deploy new versions, at any case, in the common way, you won't be able to update the old version of smart contracts, you will be forced to migrate from the old code to the new

Kon: the same problem in EVM, for example order of values in MAP, etc... to migrate you need to shift something to the new structure...

int(0.0): hi

Andrew: there are several ways to update data:   1. Provide migrated data with new code  - for this your contract should support seqno (before code update)  to be sure that latest data will be updated  - data should be migrated offchain and provided for contract   This method has the disadvantage that any data can be set. Because can be modifyed in any way (e.g. adding or deliting some data outside of migration logic)  2. Contract should support some predefined instruction for modifying data before new code will be set.  3.  I‚Äôm not sure if it possible to send some migration code in Func or Fift that will be executed while migration.

Howard: there is no proxy in Tact yet, right? (reply to 2081)

Kon: 3 - like eval? It is not supported, afaik... (reply to 2085)

Kon: I didn't see any example, yes. (reply to 2086)

Andrew: yep (reply to 2087)

Dario: 3. You can. load cell, ctos bless and execute (reply to 2085)

Andrew: So then third option is preferable, but most complicated I guess.   Theoretically, all 3 options can be implemented in tact with an native function and good understanding how FunC and Tact (underhood) works

Two communities that i have a great success participating in.  https://forums.tact-lang.org/ (forwarded from TON Development News)

Herm√®s: cool cool cool

Howard: who is the expert in https://github.com/ton-core/ton-emulator ü§£ü§£ü§£

Daniil: I'm not an "expert", but anyway, what did you want to ask? (reply to 2098)

Herm√®s: What kind of mode we should set can call like this with 0 fee and call a contract?

Herm√®s: oh, and mode in Send method is not in Docs.  https://docs.tact-lang.org/guides/send#send-typed-message   Like the content about mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendRemainingValue

Howard: I don't know about this as well. But seems it's related with FunC (reply to 2101)

Howard: I think this is a great example about native functions?  https://github.com/anstill/tact-contracts/blob/main/src/contracts/hashmap/contract.tact#L27   But would like to see more example, and how this dictionary can be use. cc @drewstill

Howard: In FunC, we have recv_internal & recv_external to set different logic when receiving the internal/external messages.   Like here [WalletV3]  - What can we do in Tact to send a external message?   Follow up with https://t.me/tactlang/783

Andrew: you can't send them from smart contracts (reply to 2106)

Steve: You can, but why?

Andrew: wait, you can send external messages from within the smart contract? (reply to 2108)

Steve: yes, you can

Steve: but this is not a popular thing and doesn't make much sence since anyone could send them

Denis: really? i mean you can send outcoming external message to MsgAddressExt but can you send external message from contract to another contract?

Steve: yes you can

Steve: but again it doesnt make sence since anyone could do so and it would be cheaper

Howard: I checked and seems haven't have people ask about ExitCode 128.   Hope anyone can give some feedback to help me navigate the bug.

Howard: I am thinking about how I can track an NFT that has already been minted?   At this moment, I will have to call the get method for the NFT Item to check if it is active.  (Right now, based on the get_nft_address_by_index , you can get the arbitrary NFT Item ID you want. And if it is inactive in status, the API call will fail when you read the data.) (reply to 1183)

Howard: I am using import util from "util"; seems also works......? (reply to 2173)

Kon: just create global variable or what is the problem with it? "BeforeAll' will be set "owner" before "it"

Howard: fixed! But new error is coming!

Howard: OK, a big thank you to @Gusarich, @telepulos, and @iftryalexg for their help. I am happy to be testing now ü´°   In general, it's not that hard, but it would still be great to have more detailed documentation, as some aspects are a bit different from Jest, I think.  (Even ChatGPT gave me the wrong answer.)

Howard: Once I got the transaction record and tried to capture some data, what should I do to compare it to the result I got from toMatchInlineSnapshot in my next expect statement?

Howard: There are multiple Tx records, and let's say I want to fetch the address from the "to" field of the first "sequo" number.  I think this is a common need in testing.

Howard: I made a mistake in my code that took me two days to figure out. I was using the == operator instead of = to assign a value to a variable, but the code still compiled without any errors.  The == operator is used for equality comparisons, not assignments. The correct operator for assignment is =.  Here's an example of the mistake I made: self.status_A == 3; // üî¥  self.status_A = 3; // ‚úÖ   So, if you're assigning a value to a variable, make sure to use a single = sign, not ==. ü•∂üòÇ

üíµ: Hi, I have a trivial question, I minted a token using the tact-jetton repository, but I can't send it to another address, what could be the problem?  The balance to pay for gas is everywhere

Steve: I have updated template to fix all issues, sorry for inconvenience https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-template

Steve: Also built a debugging article: https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/debug https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/ref/common#dump

Howard: oh nice (reply to 2199)

Howard: How can I use in my .tact file? Nothing shows during after compiled

Lev: It prints to the execution logs

Howard: ooooohhhhhhh thanks. that make sense.

Howard: Quickly two questions:  1) Is it always necessary to deploy the contract? Since I got the error for     Contract is not active    2) The log is quite long. Is it normal?

Steve: yes and yes

Steve: also create a new contract system for each test for repeatable results

Andrew: I don‚Äôt understand what snapshot tests actually test except that the contract was changed.   While developing I want to test some scenarios and keep my tests ‚Äúgreen‚Äù.    I case of snapshots I have to manually validate what have been changed and  and does scenario work correctly, after this I should decide to update snapshots or not. If I will update snapshot any time when I change code, it doesn‚Äôt make sense since it doesn't test anything. (reply to 2199)

Steve: you can review diffs of your tests and see what changes

qpwe: Steve, is it risky to use tact now in production? If so, how long will it take to reach the production level?

Steve: depends on your case. In general you can always review generated func code.

Howard: in beforeEach / beforeAll right>? (reply to 2208)

Steve: i usually just copy/paste in each case, but beforeEach/all might work too

Howard: will need tutor to explain how to read log üôå (reply to 2206)

Andrew: Yes, I mean it under manual validating, it's not very convenient, since I want to test scenarios, rather than changes in address. It also teaches me to update snapshots without looking.   My tests will fail every time when I change the code even scenarios working properly, so I can‚Äôt be sure about why it‚Äôs failed and should validate it manually. It‚Äôs completely ok when I working with something simple, but when I work with some complex scenarios I want to code check and repeat that instead of me. It's much safer especially when you work in a team and not aware about all complex scenarios, but can rely on that they tested. (reply to 2210)

Steve: we will introduce naming of addresses later to abstract it away, that would reduce dramatically changes in snapshots

Howard: the deploy you mean here is deploy in side the test cases, or I always have to deploy the contract to test-net?   Even with I change a bit in .tact file and compiled. (reply to 2207)

Steve: emulator doesn't have anything with testnet

Andrew: Can we expect something similar like ‚ÄòFlatTeansaction‚Äô in sandbox?   ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äô export type FlatTransaction = {     from?: Address     to: Address     value?: bigint     body: Cell     initData?: Cell     initCode?: Cell     deploy: boolean     lt: bigint     now: number     outMessagesCount: number     oldStatus: AccountStatus     endStatus: AccountStatus     totalFees?: bigint     aborted?: boolean     destroyed?: boolean     exitCode?: number     success?: boolean }  ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äô (reply to 2217)

Steve: Everything already provided but in a structured way, so no

Steve: For example oldStatus and endStatus is reduntary since you can provide only changes in this status, but in practice it is not useful. lt is useless thing in emulator, also it could be different from time to time. now is binded to time that would break snapshots. exitCode and success is almost the same value. outMessageCount doesn't make sence since you need to test messages that were sent. (reply to 2220)

Steve: also transaction "to" also useless since we have all transactions bound to a single contract

Steve: totalFees is simply incorrect in ton and have to be calculated separately (to be implemented in emulator)

Herm√®s: May I ask why dump didn't design as console.log that will pop the value of the contract? Rather then pop like this?  Seems not human readable. (reply to 2206)

Howard: Correct me if I am wrong: 1/ We need to implement a get method to fetch the balance of a TON address since the test library does not provide a built-in function to fetch balance information.  2/ Similar question: How to get the balance of the owner address we got temporally? (reply to 2184)

Howard: yes, just sent. Thanks. (reply to 2188)

Howard: Another question: How can we get the error code in ton-emulator?  If await contract.send() fails, it won't show up in track.collect(), right?  Also, the log output is not very usable, since it can generate thousands of lines of logs.

Steve: send usually can't fail, only system.run can throw exception when external message wasn't accepted. (reply to 2231)

Steve: Error code is reported in track.collect results, it even have an error message

Steve: right now you can call system.contract(address).state to get contract's state that includes the balance (reply to 2228)

Howard: 1/ can we put in optional that can use toNano? It's hard for me to read the amount of TON in balance. For example: (reply to 2235)

Steve: this method doesn't mean for tests, but i will generate something in bindings

Howard: nice (reply to 2237)

Howard: would like to know how this dump can shows properly in log as well (reply to 2226)

Steve: dump are shown in the very beginning of the log

Howard: but it's thousands of logs that can't show properly, no matter print it in spec.ts file or show on console.log.... (reply to 2206)

Steve: yes, i am going to release a new emulation library since i am no longer has an access to ton-emulator one

Howard: thanks a lot! I am coding deeply in Tact because of this.

Howard: Is there possible to let the "Contract" itself pay the gas from Balance?

Howard: I am thinking that my Tx sent to the smartContract might be less and unable to trigged the next tx....

Daniil: https://ton.org/docs/develop/func/stdlib/#buy_gas (reply to 2292)

Daniil: I hope there is some similar function in Tact too.

Steve: This method is not implemented though (reply to 2294)

Steve: Yes you can. set_gas_limit is the method you are looking for. The problem with this method that you are going to pay for a gas, not the guy that sent a message. The problem with this is that you can drain your contract's balance. Therefore we are yet to expose it in tact since it is very tricky thing to do. I have implemented it in our TON Nominators contract, but in practice it just put stuff at risk (but it is mitigated by other contract code for checking incoming value of messages) (reply to 2292)

Howard: as the Tact pro user, I can't find what is set_gas_limit (reply to 2297)

Andrew: https://ton.org/docs/develop/func/stdlib/#set_gas_limit (reply to 2298)

Steve: You can import it without a problem in tact using native functions (reply to 2301)

Herm√®s: I have a contract that can send the text message, but the TON doesn't fallback since the Tx failed. Why?

Steve: Have you sent it with bounce:true flag?

Herm√®s: Seems like TonConnect doesn't have bounce in parameters

Daniil: you can just send to bounceable/non-bounceable address (reply to 2307)

Herm√®s: I'm using SendTransction.

Herm√®s: How do I know the contract I send to has bounceable addr or not?

Daniil: you set the bounceable/non-bounceable flag yourself with some library like ton.js. Just use Address class from it (reply to 2310)

Herm√®s: never mind.

Herm√®s: So I can't use the TonConnect to send a bounce-able address?

Daniil: address: string

Daniil: use the bounceable or non-bounceable address, depending on what you need

Daniil: ton.js: https://github.com/ton-core/ton-core/blob/main/src/address/Address.ts#L155  TonWeb: https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb/blob/master/src/utils/Address.js#L116

Steve: Yes bounce is the default usually

Herm√®s: Got the error code 7 as well. And can't figure out where went wrong. (reply to 1906)

Lev: It's probably null in the message arguments (reply to 2327)

Kon: the common case when you can face with this error it is the case when you have defined some global variables in your smart contract and not initialized them ALL in your "init" function (reply to 2327)

Kon: because then tact generates null() for them in the funC code, and there, for example, Cell is needed... then Cell cannot be equal to null() -> you catch 7 error... the Cell variable must be initialized in your "init" function with "emptyCell()" - all variables must be initialized according to their types...

Steve: Ah I see, I forgot to implement this check

Steve: Will fix it in 1.0.0

Kon: I think you need to add some notice in the documentation, because you might run into trouble when you need to create an empty Struct

Steve: Empty structs are prohibited though

Kon: but you can define in a contract such variable: _symbol1: Symbol; then you need to initialize it.. the question is how?

Howard: Correct!! I had this before. (reply to 2329)

Steve: Yes, there is an update function that could update time. Block numbers are not precise right now since they are not really accessible from smart contracts

Howard: From the Tuple function that generated in output/TS File

Steve: Try to use v4 api

Herm√®s: just need a way to track whether "an NFT" is being activate or not lol ü§£ (reply to 2398)

Herm√®s: üëæ

Herm√®s: OK found, https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/#/accounts/get_address_getAddressState_get  Can use this method to track. (reply to 2404)

Herm√®s: Or any better way to track "whether a wallet address having how many NFTs?"

Steve: We have disabled masterchain support in tact in our latest release, candidate: https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/masterchain  Please, share you thoughts if you need it or you think that this would be a mistake.

Howard: what is that mean? We can't deploy Tact in production yet?

Steve: you can

Andrew: no, it means that you can only work in workchain (reply to 2410)

Andrew: there's a masterchain and a workchain in mainnet

Howard: ok, sounds great for me. Since I think we haven't write any implement any about Validators in Tact yet.

Gajesh: what is the Tact alternative for minting or transferring jetton tokens (by contract to a user)?

Howard: https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-standard-template  Just added the test cases! Let me know if you have any feedback. (reply to 1818)

Gajesh: or is there an example of using jetton tokens in something (reply to 2415)

Sergei: If I create a field that starts with init it breaks the highlighting

Herm√®s: Init is the primitive in Tact. Could you not use it as a variable?

Sergei: I haven't tried. I just used isInited instead (reply to 2422)

Sergei: is there const in tact?

Sergei: it seems no ü§î

Herm√®s: yes, it does. You can try as const minTonsForStorage: Int = ton("0.02");

Herm√®s: What is extend even means? Like override in Solidity?   https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/functions#extension-function

Andrew: more like extension functions in kotlin (reply to 2427)

Andrew: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html

Sergei: Hmm... I didn't find anything about const in documentation. (reply to 2426)

Herm√®s: yeh, just doing so. I am noticed this as well. But you can take reference in other's example (reply to 2430)

Herm√®s: like this one (reply to 2416)

Herm√®s: Maybe the document can put the example code in below? Kind of confusing. Since I don't code in Kotlin before.   Will send request for editing. (reply to 2428)

Sergei: I got it. Thank you! (reply to 2432)

Andrew: there is an example code already, no? (reply to 2433)

Herm√®s: an example like this maybe? Full of content that will give full picture of the language.

Herm√®s: yeh, only the define of the "Native" functions. Would be great if we add like:  // Will let you get 27 by using pow() native function let tempInt: Int = pow(3, 3); (reply to 2435)

Andrew: the result of that extension function would be the ability to make a call like this: const temp = 123.pow(45) (reply to 2438)

Herm√®s: wtf, ok you are right.   And this is why "adding a few line of code" can make newbie more easy to understand. (if we put the Rust document as a example (reply to 2440)

Andrew: true. I guess a PR would be nice (reply to 2441)

Howard: I am testing this code with do... until:  My question is that, the Send method never be executed.   I can't find why. Even the test cases were fine. Hope anyone can give the feedback for this. Thanks!

Sergei: Guys, how to undestand the contract.send method?  There are 4 different types in the wallet.spec.ts: 1. contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, 'notify'); 2. contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano('10') }, 'Deploy'); 3. contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, null); 4. ```         contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, {             $$type: 'TransferMessage',             transfer,             signature: beginCell().storeBuffer(signature).endCell()         }); ```  I'm confused by the last parameter ('notify', 'Deploy', etc...)

Howard: Those are just parameters followed the receive method you set in your contract code. Depends on what kind of parameters you support with. (reply to 2445)

Gajesh: so with in TACT is similar to is in solidity   right?

Herm√®s: which part you saw for with (reply to 2447)

Gajesh: contract Name with Jetton (reply to 2448)

Herm√®s: yeh, looks like that. but I think Tact hasn't have overwritten yet for functions

Gajesh: gotcha

Steve: It has just not published

Gajesh: is there a way to check jetton token balance of certain wallet on the blockchain? (with tact)

Gajesh: * onchain

Daniil: no way. (reply to 2453)

Gajesh: wait. wut. how do the current defi platforms work on prices (x * y = k)? (reply to 2455)

Daniil: they just store the current jetton balances inside of the exchange contracts and update them when users trade (reply to 2456)

Gajesh: oh boy

Gajesh: also so can i read data from other contracts?  for example, there is contract A which wants to know contract B's owner

Daniil: only if the contract B has some opcode which returns the message with it's owner (in this example) (reply to 2459)

Daniil: but you can't get that info in the same transaction. the only way is to send some "request" message and wait for "response" message

Gajesh: oh okay

Gajesh: new to Tact. so tons of questions in mind haha.   - what's the alternative to address(this) in tact?  - can a contract sign messages? (i assume yes)

Daniil: "signing" messages usually means that you just sign it with your private key and store the signature in the beginning of data. but smart contracts usually don't have any private keys (it would be strange to store the private key publicly on-chain) so it makes no sense (reply to 2463)

Daniil: and why would you need to sign some message by a contract?

Daniil: if contract B receives a message from contract A, it can be 100% sure that it is really from contract A

Gajesh: got it.

Gajesh: and is there a way to transfer jettons in same transaction?  for example, for DEX or farm.

Howard: myAddress() => means address(this) in Solidity (reply to 2463)

Gajesh: and commenting in Tact is similar to FunC?

Gajesh: {/* comment */}

Kon: no, // /*

Gajesh: thanks (reply to 2473)

Gajesh: is there array or array-equivalent on Tact?

Kon: Struct

Kon: Map

Kon: Map from struct

Gajesh: oh got it.

Step: Can store unlimited number of key value?? (reply to 2478)

Step: I heard there is 255 limit on something?

Gajesh: oh what. u can only have 255 keys and values? (reply to 2481)

Howard: You can return a full Mapping in get method by the way.

Howard: Can't be sure what the limitation is for it.

Daniil: On tuple (reply to 2481)

Daniil: Maps can store almost any amount of keys

Herm√®s: Can we put this in Tact and FunC?  https://github.com/shobrook/adrenaline

Howard: üòµ Does anyone knows why the line of code after do didn't execute? (reply to 2444)

Gajesh: how can i token transferFrom user to contract w/ tact?

Whizzieüêæ: Hello guys

Whizzieüêæ: I'm just starting up in ton, I have been building in  Ethereum

Whizzieüêæ: Just about to start learning func, but kind of confuse about it and tact. Can someone help me out please.  May be just as we write smart contracts on Ethereum with solidity, on ton, is it with FunC or tact?

Howard: Using SDK? (reply to 2490)

Gajesh: which sdk? (reply to 2494)

Howard: Can you fix the sentences through ChatGPT? Can't understand properly what do you want. (reply to 2493)

Gajesh: for example, i have a deposit function which should deposit 100 USDC from user to contract.  how can i possibily implement it

Howard: You can use ton-cli to send tx through the traditional way with the moment.    Or you can use the deploy.ts file to generate a URL and execute it through TonKeeper on mobile (reply to 2495)

Gajesh: no no

Gajesh: i want it to be done onchain

Howard: You can write a smart contract through FunC or Tact, or Fift language. But not recommend in Fift lang. (reply to 2493)

Whizzieüêæ: Oh, I think it's a bit clear now, FunC and Tact are two different programming language right.? (reply to 2501)

Gajesh: does Tact support 1e12 or `1e10)

talkol: pow(10, 10) in 1.0.0rc

Steve: isn't it doesn't work right now? (reply to 2506)

Gajesh: oh

talkol: was this issue resolved? https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/18 because I couldn't compile code with pow

Steve: i am looking at this now, i am not sure why it doesn't work. Seems that it should be compile only.

talkol: undefined function ** in func

Steve: actually it seems that "**" does not exist in func

Dario: afaik, there is no pow in ton, only pow2  pow should be implemented like this  https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/blob/main/contracts/math/math.func#L7 (reply to 2510)

Steve: yeah, it is just too expensive

talkol: maybe we should use a directive like ** in tact so it doesn't work in runtime but in compile time with constant literals only

talkol: https://tact-by-example.org  we're also working on this üôÇ

Howard: wow, it looks good for me.

Sergei: I got some trouble. If I use const in the reciver:   receive(msg: TopUp) {       require(!self.data.isInited, "Already inited");        const addA: Int = msg.coinsA;       const addB: Int = msg.coinsB;        self.data.balanceA = self.data.balanceA + addA;       self.data.balanceB = self.data.balanceB + addB;        require(self.data.balanceA + self.data.balanceB > myBalance(), "Not enough money for init");     }   I get an error (on the screenshot). But if I use let it works well

Howard: I think that is b/c the const value will store in different location in SmartContract? The place that can not be read in temp value or something. (reply to 2532)

Sergei: you mean after compilation? (reply to 2534)

Howard: yeh, in FunC level or the Fift language I think. (reply to 2535)

Sergei: How can I load coins from the message?  message TopUp {     coinsA: Int as coins;     coinsB: Int as coins; }  receive(msg: TopUp) {     // .... ? }

Daniil: msg.coinsA (reply to 2537)

Sergei: I tried it but contract balance didn't change. Only for a gas fee. Or I should to add that ammount to the value? contract.send(walletA, { value: toNano("0.01") }, { $$type: "TopUp", coinsA: toNano(5), coinsB: 0n }); (reply to 2538)

Daniil: because the value is just 0.01 ton. Yes, you should add 5 ton to the value (in this case). TON Blockchain itself doesn't know anything about your custom message structures and functions. You just send some value and some additional info attached (reply to 2539)

Steve: Hey, i have the only one visible task to finish before i am able to cut 1.0.0  https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/20

Steve: We will provide some limited capability of upgrades soon

Howard: Planning to deploy my code in production but still very worried about the bugs as well. üòµ (reply to 2554)

Howard: Hi all, basically we can use below code in Solidity to let contract wait for a few blocks. I made the similar one down below: But the Tx always out of gas.   Is it because we can't do this in TVM or?

Daniil: It's really a bad idea to rely on ChatGPT suggestions that much (reply to 2564)

Daniil: You can't do that this way neither in EVM or TVM

Daniil: You can skip 1+ block in TON by sending a message to some bounce contract in masterchain and receiving it back

Howard: The idea behind this is that I want to ensure that a series of transactions cannot be made at the same block height. From a security standpoint, I do not want to allow any possibility of flash deposits or withdrawals. That is why I want the code to wait for a while, perhaps now() + 1000 would suffice.  Other than that, I can't think of a better way to achieve this.  What do you mean by 'skip 1 + block'? There is no 'skip' primitive keyword in Tact, right? (reply to 2567)

Daniil: I just explained how you can "skip" a few blocks in the same message above (reply to 2568)

Howard: ok, got your point. Let my try out and checked into the Logical Time. (reply to 2569)

Maksim: in tests, how to send something to  contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano('10') }, 'Debug');  as internal message from another contract?  Is it possible to create treasure from certain address?

Steve: you can create multiple treasures, do you want to use some specific address?

Gajesh: what is the easiest way to deploy tact contract?

Maksim: yes, I want to test specific address of another contract to test access control function, which calculates address of caller from code and init (reply to 2590)

Andrew: github.com/ton-community/blueprint (reply to 2597)

Steve: Idk, i still don't understand what blueprint tries to achieve. We are building a tool integrated with contract code verification: https://verifier.ton.org

Steve: that would allow you to connect your wallet to it and perform deploy, verify and a lot of other thigs

Maksim: any ideas? (reply to 2590)

Steve: i recommend just to use different treasures and deploy your contracts according to addresses from this treasures

Steve: if it is dependent on another contract, i recommend just to test once contract at once

Howard: yes, you can take a reference with the repo https://github.com/ton-core/tact-template/blob/41619417e653fbea6d39e171dffaeb9e9074cd22/sources/transfer.ts (reply to 2591)

Howard: Question: - If I verify the code, will it increase the risk for a hack?  - Even if I give people my FunC file, could they still find a way to attack? What if I show them the TS file we obtained after compiling? (reply to 2599)

Howard: you can set the jetton wallet inside the beforeAll? (reply to 2607)

Gajesh: is there an example to use the send() in typescript generated in output

Seitaro: https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/func#tensor-return-types From the examples, I don't understand when a getter returns a tuple and when a tensor? Does ? at the end defines the output form?

Howard: For my experience, the Maybe on FunC is equal the ? in Tact.  Here is the example, the TEP62 vs my NFT standard code. (reply to 2612)

Howard: But since I am not expert in FunC hope this helpeful.

Seitaro: Yeah, it is about serialization to the cells. I think that I understand how it works, the question is about get functions which do not serialize but leave bare variables on the stack. Looks like (at least from docs) sometimes those variables are wrapped to tuple and sometimes not. (reply to 2613)

Herm√®s: is it unlimited? ex. map<Int, Int> let's say (reply to 2487)

Gajesh: yes (reply to 2618)

Steve: direct compatibility with func tensors only for non-nullable types since we can't represent nullable tensors in func anyway and there are no need for backward compatibility, but when it is an optional type it returns tuple (or null). (reply to 2612)

Steve: And all inner references are wrapped to tuples. In essence struct/messages is always a tuple except the special case of a tensor representation on top level that was built for func-level compatibility with standards.

Herm√®s: What would it look like to implement an Upgradable or Proxy contract in TON? While OpenZeppelin's template is good, it can be difficult for some people to understand and implement.  One example of a challenging implementation is the Diamond Standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535). It's important to consider these scenarios before implementing upgradable methods for contracts, as they can be difficult to maintain and implement.  I believe that ease of understanding is key to onboarding more developers.

Placeholder: Is there any need in such proxies in ton, considering that ton contracts are upgradable by design? (reply to 2642)

Andrew: yeah, all you have to do is call set_code() (reply to 2644)

talkol: it's indeed very easy to upgrade code in ton, but in tact it requires some thinking.. for example what do we do about the ABI? simply change it?

Daniil: Maps don't keep their size anywhere. But you can store the size in a separate variable for example, and update it everytime you add/delete something from a map (reply to 2650)

Eugene: I'm touching Tact for the first time and I already have a silly question. Tact docs and tact-by-example use fun for functions, but on the tact-lang.org main page I see fn.

User<6247944943>: Both smart contracts.

Alex: Wallet (contract) is a smart contract too.  About defining which one (type of) smart contract we have, for instance, blockchain explorers trying access to the typical GetMethods(get_public_key() - wallet, get_wallet_data() - jetton). (reply to 2675)

Andrew: you can also look at the contract's code (reply to 2675)

Daniil: There are several versions of wallets. And new versions may appear in future. Also don't forget there may be some custom implementations of wallets (why not?). (reply to 2678)

Andrew: I can expose some get methods on my contract but the code would implement some logic that's not related to wallet at all. In this case you'll get false-positive if you only rely on get-methods

Andrew: and you'll miss the ones that don't comply with the standard (reply to 2683)

Daniil: Is there a standard for wallets? :) (reply to 2685)

Andrew: I meant the get-methods that you'd rely on (reply to 2680)

User<6247944943>: sorry, I mean in Tact code level.   I want to add a check that the owner of a smart contract must be the WalletV4. (reply to 2677)

Alex: Get Methods in the Tact version will used by the same way, just double check their signature(for example with .md output files or .tact source).  For the WalletV4 contract it was recommended to use the FunC version. There is no implementation of WalletV4 with Tact language.  Tact must be used to create new cross-contract services with complex on-chain business logic.  If I read right your task: 1) Get owner's address from "smart contract" 2) Try to use get method on owner's address.  Perhaps, open-source blockchain explorers could be helpful to research this deeper. (reply to 2688)

Howard: What is the difference for using get fun vs (private) fun if they both can return value and passing the data to go some calculation.   Maybe the usage in Gas is difference as well?

Howard: I have a question about the "RemainingValue" feature. Here is an example of code: when we run multiple lines of code and need to transfer the rest of the value, we usually use the SendRemainingValue mode.  My question is, how do we properly pay for the second Send function? We need to keep some TONs in the contract for storage and the minimum gas cost, so how can we ensure that the remaining value is transferred correctly while also keeping enough funds in the contract?

Steve: SendRemainingValue, it is a flag

Howard: Yes, and I don't use that method. I usually use the following approach:    However, this method can't calculate properly if my Send functions are in the second, or third if loop.

Howard: I was only able to solve this issue by setting minTonsForStorage and gasConsumption to ton("0.1").   Do you know why the transaction paused there in my previous example code? It seems like there might have been an issue with the msgValue measurement. (reply to 2692)

talkol: Get fun is for end users querying your contract. I wouldn‚Äôt call them from inside the contract (reply to 2690)

Howard: I thought of it more as a view function in Solidity, which doesn't cost much in gas. Thank you for letting me know. (reply to 2696)

Howard: to keep the contract remaining some amount of TON in there, should I use:          send(SendParameters{             value: 0,             to: self.owner,              mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendRemainingBalance,             bounce: false         });  or          send(SendParameters{             value: myBalance() - ton("0.1),             to: self.owner,              mode: SendIgnoreErrors,             bounce: false         }); (reply to 1328)

Howard: 1/ I understand from the documentation that we need to keep a certain amount of TON in the contract.  2/ That's why I used a function to calculate the remaining value we need to keep in the contract, building on Steve's previous code.  3/ However, the problem arises when we need to use multiple send transactions (based on one input receive function method). In these cases, we need to properly calculate the remaining value.  Sometimes, the value I wrote like this fails. I suspect this might be due to the dynamic gas cost, which could prevent us from achieving the minimum value we set to keep in the contract. (reply to 2693)

talkol: It‚Äôs a good question Howard! (reply to 2706)

talkol: I want to start writing a section in tact-by-example about gas strategies

Howard: I just uploaded my version of jetton implementation in Tact, which: - enables minting of an arbitrary amount of tokens by only the owner set initially - anyone can call with the command Mint: 100 to mint tokens one by one - the status for mintability can be changed. Only the owner can close the minting feature. - supports the Transfer function with two methods:  a) using mnemonics to trigger it - URL b) using a URL to transfer jetton tokens to a new owner. - URL - Set a max supply initially when you deploy the code  https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact

Howard: After trying to implement more FunC files into Tact, I believe that Tact simplifies the implementation of complex and diverse business ideas. This is especially useful for building POCs.  In general, Tact is a very helpful tool.

Maksim: It's very interesting to find out where and when Tact gives way to funC. I'm gonna do some experiments.

Howard: anyone tried out pow before? Got this crashed when compile

Maksim: i've used it for simple things like pow(10, 27), it worked (reply to 2739)

Andrew: I guess it's due to the variables being present in the expression (reply to 2739)

Howard: don't know, seems it's not in global standard https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/commit/925a9332ae67d03d45412f2809131c1a39921861 (reply to 2741)

Daniil: Error says it all. Pow() in tact works only for constants (reply to 2739)

Daniil: (why?)

talkol: So people won‚Äôt make gas assumptions for it (reply to 2744)

talkol: You can implement a runtime Pow function yourself if you need it in runtime

Maksim: @howard_peng how did you calculate message op code  message(0xd53276db) TokenExcesses {} did you calculate from message schema, or just defined random hex?

Daniil: - yes, it is calculated from scheme  - it is defined in jetton standard: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md#tl-b-schema (reply to 2747)

Daniil: Yes, check the link I've attached  Also: https://docs.ton.org/learn/overviews/tl-b-language#constructors (reply to 2749)

Daniil: crc32('excesses query_id:uint64 = InternalMsgBody') = 0x553276db | 0x80000000 = 0xd53276db

Steve: tact is different

Maksim: how different? i need to know opcodes to do bounced() handler (reply to 2752)

Steve: completely different, you shouldn't calculate them yourself

Steve: you can check generated id in md file

Howard: I know that I can put any customized opcode that I want, but I don't understand the difference or the outcome that will result from setting it with message(0x01) Minting { } as well.   I can't sure as well. (reply to 2747)

Dario: Why? Also, how tact pack data in cells? (reply to 2754)

Dario: I dont find any description about it

Steve: https://docs.tact-lang.org/evolution/OTP-004

Dario: Thanks!

Dario: So basically sequentially. Its a waste imho

Steve: mostly it is as efficient as manual allocation

Dario: There are a few optimization that can be done in tact to avoid begin_cell().end_cell() with static fields, for example, when there is a lot of data. Instead of serializating it, you can just store the loaded cell and store it directly. So you might keep that that change and static data in different cells for example. Eg in jetton wallet, minter and owner never change

Steve: it won't improve much

Dario: If there are other data, you can keep static data in another cell and avoid serialization when updating storage. Just an example

Steve: you will save on 20 gas at most

Dario: Actually, depends on how much data there is (reply to 2764)

Steve: you shouldn't use too much data

Dario: Just an example, i think this kind of optimization should be managed

Dario: No, you are removing a NEWC and ENDC, you save a lot of gas (reply to 2766)

Steve: in jetton contract everything is stored in a single cell

Steve: not that much to optimize

Dario: As I already said, i was taking about more complex contracts (or jetton wallet if you have MORE fields than standard one). You cant skip this optimization if everything fits in 1023 bits. But again, a simple serialization to me looks very inefficient, especially when working with complex contract (eg check ston-fi contracts)

Dario: There are other optimizations Ive been thinking of, maybe i will post then in dev chats

Maksim: What chats? (reply to 2774)

Dario: Idk tondev etc

Steve: You can do your own optimizations without relying on Tact itself by importing func implementations

Howard: üòÇ

‚Äî 2023-03-27 ‚Äî

Howard: What is the best recommend to avoid "Integer out of expected range"?   - it will crashed if I assign toNano(10) for the jetton amount that I want to mint with a price_weight - 10n (bigint) tho.    Thought toNano(10) represent a call to the toNano function with the argument 10, which should convert 10 TON to nanotons, resulting in 10. 000 000 000 nanotons.

Howard: ok, made some mistake.   The length of data type coins is not long enough for jetton amounts. If you can't sure how much jetton token with the totally supply can just set with Int rather then uint32(which is range 0 to 4,294,967,295) - followed by Tact-by-example for more details (reply to 2792)

Howard: Would you like to see an example of a Jetton-ICO template? Check out this link: https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-ico-example/blob/552c545b0e129623cc0856ba7b036a8f661a7d27/sources/contract.tact#L29  Here are some tips for using this template: - Set the multiplier to determine the amount of Jetton tokens people can get per TON. For example, if you set it to 2500, then 1 TON for minting can get 2500 new Jetton tokens.  - There is a 1.5% fee implemented in TON for fundraising. And only enable withdraw by initial admin.  - In Tact, make sure not to use now() inside the init() function, or your contract code will change addresses based on block height.  - You can set an expiration date based on the starting logical time you want in Unix timestamp.   inspired by: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-minter-ICO.fc (reply to 2792)

Steve: You are using old compiler if calling now affects address

Howard: when checking with the contract code on getgems.io, noticed that they prepared with the boc code of each contracts.   Where can I find the boc code of my contract we compiled in Tact?

Howard: oh, I think we have in here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/evolution/OTP-006#specification (reply to 2799)

‚Äî 2023-03-28 ‚Äî

Herm√®s: waht do yuo measn (reply to 2803)

Howard: You can use it as a multiplier, meaning from an altcoin perspective, you can think of it as placing a leveraged bet by investing in the altcoin. If you examine the price correlation chart, you can conclude that in a bull market, it's better to hold onto ETH, but in a bear market, holding altcoins may have more potential for growth. This is why I refer to it as a 'weight' or multiplier from a data standpoint.  On the other hand, from a psychological standpoint, holding a larger amount of any currency feels better regardless of the type. Holding 1 billion Zimbabwean dollars feels better than $1 US dollar, for sure. (reply to 2804)

Howard: ü§£ correct, maybe I should delete that. But I also hope help people knows that they can find boc info in output folder haha (reply to 2806)

Herm√®s: In Tact level, can we check the owner of a NFT contract is a Wallet Adress or other Smart Contracts?

Herm√®s: Since I want my NFT contract to verify the ownership transfer before proceeding.  I'm looking for a way to ensure that the destination address is a valid wallet address and not some other type of address.   This will help prevent any potential issues that could arise from transferring ownership to an incorrect address(non-Wallet Address)

‚Äî 2023-04-01 ‚Äî

Howard: Honestly, from my knowledge, you can't do that since walletV4 is also the smart contract itself.   This means you can't distinguish whether the address is a ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù or whether the smart contract is for NFT marketplace purposes. (reply to 2824)

Howard: You will need to convert to Slice data type with Address in FunC.  But in Tact will be much more easier, Address is Address. The Slice usually use for specific usage like forward_payload, here is the example:

Yuri: Got it. I'd like to know because there's a TEP standard that I would need to provide the address as Slice. I want to know if I can return it as an Address. (reply to 2882)

Howard: Slice is just a data type that use quite often in TVM. Especially Cell and so on. üëçüèø

Yuri: Is there any shortcut for addr_none?

Dario: It does it at compile time or exec? (reply to 2906)

Daniil: 1. no. at the beginning of the code, after the imports 2. I know, and I need to be notified that my wallet has received tokens. (reply to 2925)

Daniil: As I can see, my wallet receives a notification with the correct op code, but for unknown reason the contract does not recognize this transaction. (reply to 2927)

Howard: I am guessing if you are trying to let "Charge a tiny TON when your Jetton Token being transfer", then you should add this extract Send method in the Transfer receive method.

Howard: oh, I asked this few weeks ago.    Right now the explorer didn't decode those informations. But you still can decode it by yourself. (reply to 2928)

Howard: Just want to share with you that I just tried to build an example of an NFT staking contract today. You can mint the NFT then: - Put the NFT into a staking status, although it's not strictly considered staking since the ownership of the NFT doesn't change. (*Compared with NFTs for sale on Getgems.io, where you have to transition ownership to a new contract.)  - The amount of TON each NFT can claim is based on the Weight it has in the total weight amount of the pool. The weight is based on the duration you choose when  staking.  - To put it simply, if we use the Transfer function(we defined on TEP62)  to stake the NFT, the Transfer function won't be able to bring the information of the NFT itself to the staking contract (e.g. rarity information, level of NFT like we did here in this example).  - But you can still implement your Transfer function with more customized information in custom_payload, although that could make the contract too complicated I guess.  More questions and expansion: 1/ Why don't you design the feature like the NFT sale contract in Getgems.io?  Since the core feature for NFT staking should be based on rarity, I added the Level to the NFT item itself (in code, randomly generated from 1 to 100). This means the ratio of the share you have in the staking pool is based on the level of the NFT itself and the duration you choose, such as 24 hours, 3 days, or more.  2/ What else can we do with this? Basically, we will need to add a "cool-down" feature, so people can't flash deposit and stake NFT to get a heavy share of weight and then claim the TON coin, etc.  3/ Can we implement Jetton claiming as well? Sure, we can! But since I think it's easier to implement this staking feature here than staking NFTs and then claiming Jetton tokens.

Daniil: What's the idea behind this? Collection owner will just share their funds to NFT stakers? (reply to 2944)

Howard: I don't know, any feedback or any FunC code want to migrate in Tact feel free to DM me.  The idea is that I hope to get more feedback for the code itself, since I'm trying to build something in production but can't find reliability or auditing support(more code I already tried). I believe that sharing more code in the community can help Tact grow more quickly.

Daniil: Oh, so just to showcase the real Tact usage examples. Okay

Howard: Maybe you can route the Royalties fee to the staking contract? There are some use cases for this in the ETH ecosystem. (reply to 2945)

nonam3e: hey all, Are func functions like dict_get_min?() dict_get_max?() dict_get_next?() dict_get_prev?() implemented in tact? Is it possible to use inline func in tact?

Steve: you can import func files into tact and define native functions to use them

nonam3e: can you give me an example? I looked through tact documentation https://docs.tact-lang.org and haven't seen examples of defining native funcs. (reply to 2971)

Steve: https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/guides/functions#native-functions

nonam3e: got it, thanks (reply to 2973)

Steve: importing func code is as simple as tact one: import "./code.fc";

Steve: func stdlib is already included though

nonam3e: Should it look like this or I can't use structs for it? struct DictGetMinResult {     minKey: Int;     value: Slice;     flag: Int; }  @name(dict_get_min?) native native_dictGetMin(dict: Cell, key_len: Int): DictGetMinResult;

Steve: you can, they are mapped to tensors as is

nonam3e: nice (reply to 2978)

nonam3e: I was worried about it

nonam3e: Is there an option to convert Slice to some struct? Or should I do it manually using funcs like load_ref ?

Steve: Manually

Steve: What‚Äôs the usecase?

&rey: (Cell to some struct) Parsing config parameter containing dict of (shard id) ‚Äî> (storage fees). (reply to 2983)

nonam3e: To use previous native function as it is for any value type of a map (reply to 2983)

Steve: For this usecase it is better to just write parser manually (reply to 2984)

&rey: To be honest, all those difficulties just make it easier to use FunC and not to worry about Tact/Rift limitations üôÇ (reply to 2986)

Steve: Feel free to use func

Howard: üßê Maybe you could share more examples about this. Otherwise, I think it could significantly increase the learning curve for developers with intermediate-level skills.   After all, our goal from the beginning was to make the language-learning process as simple as possible, wasn't it? (reply to 2987)

&rey: Here's the code of Stabletimer at the moment I abandoned Tact. https://github.com/ProgramCrafter/ton-stable-timer/blob/tact/sources/contract.tact (reply to 2991)

Howard: Thinking that can we store the TransactionHash once it is executed? More liks this in Solidity

Howard: *checkSignature is for wallet signing. I would like to point out that in Tact, Hash is stored as an Int.   And I can't find what I need in FunC as well: https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/stdlib#hashes

Steve: i don't think you need to store tx itself since storage event would be emitted within transaction itself

Howard: Oh. Thinking can use Transaction Hash put as an integer source which is randomly generated(at least confirmed after the tx is executed (reply to 2998)

Steve: What‚Äôs the use case though?

Howard: Trying to put the Hash of the transaction put as a parameter for the NFTs itself.

Howard: For Jetton token transfer:  What if we want to allow the owners to transfer (stake) jetton in a staking contract by implementing "advanced Tx in Transfer messages"?  - Should we implement msg: Stake in custom_payload or forward_payload?  - Has anyone tried this before?

Andrew: in Tonpay I use custom forward_payload to trigger a chain of complex actions upon receiving the jettons (reply to 3022)

Howard: oh, you were using Tact for that or FunC? (reply to 3023)

Andrew: func

‚Äî 2023-05-09 ‚Äî

Howard: Hey @Arterialist, I have tried using both "custom_payload" and "forward_payload" on both sides.  Here is my TypeScript code that compresses the data format I want to send with, which is the message format I want to execute.   In this case, it is the "Stake" function in my Staking contract, and it is the new owner of this Jetton amount. (Shows in second graph, and those modules were generated by Tact lang)

Howard: The Staking Contract will got exitCode: 130, which is "Invalid incoming message".   My assumption is that, we can't compressed the "Stake Message format for the Staking contract" like that?   Since the Cell data should be correct. Maybe someone had tried this before as well? (reply to 3029)

Howard: This is my StakingContract code for Stake method then. (reply to 3031)

Andrew: you need to handle op::transfer_notification from jetton-wallet.fc in your Staking contract (reply to 3032)

Andrew: and your Stake  message will be inside the forward_payload in the transfer notification

Howard: ohhhh, you mean implement   message(0x7362d09c) TokenNotification {     queryId: Int as uint64;     amount: Int as coins;     from: Address;     forward_payload: Slice as remaining; // Comment Text message when Transfer the jetton  }  in my staking contract? OK, interesting. Let me try out. (reply to 3033)

Andrew: yes (reply to 3035)

Howard: OK seems works. Although we can't see the "Message" itself in Comment area on Explorer.

Howard: But yeh, I think I get your point and understand how "Jetton Transfer" implement in other "non-wallet contracts". Thanks a lot @Arterialist !

‚Äî 2023-05-10 ‚Äî

Howard: let's say I store Address into a Cell in TypeScript, which function I can use in to load the Address?

Andrew: .loadAddress() (reply to 3042)

Howard: Seems docs missed loadAddress?

Howard: ah, okok

Howard: A question arose while dealing with a staking contract: The Jetton staking contract receives a message from TokenNotification(0x7362d09c), but the message itself doesn't contain the "Jetton Minter Contract information".  My question is, how can we ensure that the user is transferring the correct Jetton token into the staking contract?  - I know the staking contract I wrote can functionally support all the transferred tokens, but in our case, we don't want that.   - In other words, how can we define a "Wallet Contract" that can only receive a specific Jetton token?

Howard: Oh, you might suggest editing the logic inside the TokenTransferInternal, but since not all jetton tokens would support that, it might not be a feasible solution. For instance, the WrappedTON contract is already deployed in the FunC file."

Andrew: you need to know the jetton master address of the jetton you want to receive, as well as jetton wallet code for that jetton. Upon receiving the transfer notification, you can calculate the correct address of the jetton wallet using that data + sender address from transfer notification forward payload, and compare it with the sender address of the message you received (reply to 3046)

Andrew: refer to https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons#jetton-processing-on-chain

Andrew: here you can see the address calculation logic for jettons in func - https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-utils.fc

Howard: I see, same as NFT item <> NFT Collection tho. got it got it.   So basically I will need implement/import the Jetton Wallet contract initially with my Jetton Staking contract tho(to catch the init code)

Howard: will you like to help with me check our Tact version of Jetton Wallet code(init code) is the same as the jetton token in FunC? (oUSDT, iUSDT, wTON... so on so for)  I think I will take times to do so as well tho. (reply to 3050)

Andrew: let's try (reply to 3052)

‚Äî 2023-05-11 ‚Äî

Howard: OK, since the Tact version of jetton code in init Cell might be different with the FunC one.    I will say if you want to build any expand contracts like DEXs or Staking contract in Tact, you will need import these functions to fetch the correct Jetton Wallet init_code (reply to 3050)

Howard: üî•

Howard: Does anyone try out `emit()` yet?  And how we read it off-chain through RPC?

Daniil: Wow! It's very good that this was added to Tact.  These are external messages or "messages to nowhere". They can actually have some kind of  a recipient (just an arbitrary bytes value). They are stored in blocks as any other messages, so you can access them using any preferred API. (reply to 3059)

Howard: what API you mentioned? to fetch data from on-chain event emit()

Howard: From my understanding, this is the method that we can monitoring "Minting process" is success or not right? Rather than just Error ExitCode stages.   This is exactly the same as emit in Solidity

Howard: ü•µ need to know how to fetch the emit() data through the TS file we got after compiled

Howard: Sure, here's your text with improved grammar and an attempt at providing a potential answer:  Fundamentally, a message will be delivered "on-chain", but it won't be directed to any specific address.  However, the current challenge for me is finding an API that can assist in fetching information from the body of the message, so I can decode the message for the emit message I've set.  In this screenshot, it's 0xcdbea1c3. (reply to 3064)

&rey: *I suppose you already have some way to fetch account transactions. You need to fetch transactions and check outgoing messages. The messages directed to null are external-out messages. (reply to 3064)

Steve: i have a very hacky library that could parse messages using ABI: https://github.com/tact-lang/ton-abi  Here is an example how to forward types from bidings: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-emulator/blob/a9a41d0be50cf03612bfbf15814c3a716cbccac2/src/emulator/ContractSystem.ts#L175  Then just call registry.parse and it would hopefuly parse your message  It does not support everything, i think dicts are not implemented.

Howard: The practical uses for this feature (please correct me if I'm wrong) are:  1/ Compared to sending a message to a contract, storing it, and then using the get method to read it from on-chain to off-chain, using emit() can help us avoid paying high gas fees to check the data.  2/ Another advantage is the lower latency since you can read the message through the "out message body", decode the message, and get the data we want by fetching the transaction data from the API. (reply to 3069)

Steve: it is useful to store some kind of logs, for example when NFT was minted explicitly

Howard: Thanks! Followed the modules we got in TS files, I tried to decode the message I got here like this:  "te66ccu...." is the message I got from dton.io API. (reply to 3067)

Howard: but will get error since the { throw Error('Invalid prefix'); }

Howard: 1/ Is the approach I tried incorrect? 2/ @steve_kite, could you please explain why we need the ABI in your previous reply? (reply to 3075)

‚Äî 2023-05-14 ‚Äî

Howard: I had try this tho, but didn't success..... (reply to 3069)

&rey: te6ccu... is BOC, you can base64-decode it and feed into something like Cell.oneFromBoc. (reply to 3075)

Howard: 1/ what is Cell.oneFromBoc means?  2/ Oh and we succeed! I solve by doing this:

Howard: YES, I think for dton.io giving the graphQL that can fetch the BOC data for the message output is great!

Howard: So this is the way that we can get out_put message from the ABI code?  Like this te6cc.... BOCs data inside of a message output? (reply to 3069)

Brave: üë®‚Äçüíª (reply to 3085)

‚Äî 2023-05-15 ‚Äî

Howard: Can we enforce a transaction to bounce back even if the user sends a Transfer method with bounce: false?   For now the TON will stuck in the contract for mistake.  (This line of code is the TS file)

Daniil: That's the purpose of setting "bounce: false" ‚Äî to force contract not to bounce back on errors (reply to 3087)

Daniil: Why would you want it to still bounce

Howard: for some cases, like "only certain amount of TON in the contract then enable to claim...etc" (reply to 3089)

Howard: One proper solution might be using a parameter storing the Number of balance(and modified once message change contract status), rather than using "myBalance()". (reply to 3091)

nonam3e: I'd use require() statement in this situation. (reply to 3091)

Daniil: Then why would the user send with bounce: false flag? (reply to 3091)

Howard: Because if we set limitations using myBalance() and allow users to send transactions with bounce: false, it may create an incentive for users to increase the balance of the contract by continuously sending such transactions themselfs. (reply to 3094)

Nick: Hi, guys. I‚Äôve faced with an issue of backwards compatibility of contracts on Tact  My v1 version had one kind  generated of opcode value for the operation, but v2 had a different generated opcode for the same operation  I know I can manually change auto generated by Tact funC code  and to insert the v1 opcodes values   But still, is there a more correct way to support backwards compatibility of already deployed and used contracts

Steve: op ids never changed starting from v1.0.0 everything before was marked as unstable. So I don‚Äôt think opcodes are changed, but you can override it‚Äôs value just put it in the brackets after keyword message

Nick: Thank you, makes sense

nonam3e: is break keyword for loops implemented in tact?

Steve: no, since it is not implemented in func too

&rey: Move the loop into its own function and use return. (reply to 3117)

nonam3e: Have someone got an error like Func compilation error: path/sources/output/project_contract.code.fc:122:190: error: parameters of an assembler built-in function must have a well-defined fixed width   forall X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, X10, X11, X12, X13, X14, X15, X16 -> tuple __tact_tuple_create_17((X0, X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9, X10, X11, X12, X13, X14, X15, X16) v) asm "17 TUPLE";?

‚Äî 2023-05-22 ‚Äî

Howard: One advanced application of msg.forward_payload: Is it possible to append the data of the NFT item itself after the Transfer method has been executed? According to TEP62 here (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md), they "should be equal".  However, since we can't directly view or fetch information from the NFT itself using view/get function, we have to solely rely on the message.

Howard: I am endeavoring to construct an NFT staking system. My NFT may be based on Levels or on-chain rarity, meaning that a simple transfer wouldn't suffice.  What I need is a transfer method that includes the NFT's storage data information within the forward_payload for certain. (reply to 3121)

Seitaro: The are two limits: one of funC level (no more than 16 arguments for asm functions) and another one on TVM level (TUPLE¬†opcode only accepts up to 16 variables, for more TUPLEVAR¬†should be used). (reply to 3120)

Seitaro: So we need Tact to get updated to solve this. Second issue is easy, while proper solution of first one requires either either fix on funC level or dirty hack, something like forall X0 ... X15 -> stash_16_elements((X0 ..., X15) v) asm "NOP";

nonam3e: Oh, I didn't know about it. I managed to compress this struct and the problem is solved. Btw how does tact store struct? Firstly I thought tact stores it in one cell and I had an error because of the limits of the cell (reply to 3123)

Seitaro: If you can isolate part of the code that have such behavior - please send it to me. (reply to 3127)

Seitaro: We know a few ways to make compilation very very long, but all off them are quite synthetic and should not occur in real life.

nonam3e: The contract doesn't really have complicated functions. It just has a lot of data in it and many simple functions. So I don't know if there's a reason to try to find the place where it crashes (reply to 3132)

&rey: Maybe you could deploy the contract with less data in init state, then fill storage with the first message? (reply to 3134)

Ilya: Could you please tell me how I can iterate over a dictionary in a loop?

Howard: there is no dictionary in Tact? any code example you can point out? (reply to 3140)

Ilya: I mean map type (reply to 3141)

Howard: I will set a parameter to count the total length of the map, b/c there is no way to get the length of a map directly.

User<6247944943>: For the gas-efficiency, what is the best choice to use: 1) require  2) if...{} statement?   Like here

Steve: First one

Ilya: In this example, I'm simply writing the message as a whole. However, what I actually need is to append the data each time a new message is received. When writing, it is necessary to check if the key exists. Yes, I am aware that there is no length or count method for dictionaries. Of course, I can keep track of the dictionary's length, but how can I compute it? (reply to 3143)

Steve: It is unavailable in ton, you have to count it manually

Ilya: Am I understanding correctly that this task can only be solved using the Map type if I'm adding only one entry at a time, and in that case, I can keep track of the length? (reply to 3146)

Seitaro: on TVM and funC level there are opcodes to check whether there is this key in the dict and "add/set" ops (add - adds key-value only if key is non-existent). I'm not sure whether there is native functions for maps which implement it, but probably you can add funC wrapper (reply to 3148)

Seitaro: you also can keep track of map length too

Ilya: Oh, I can store count in PushMapMessage... üôâ thank you!

Steve: you can just get value by key and check if it is null (reply to 3149)

Ilya: Yes, I know that, thanks. The problem was that I had bound to the map type in PushMapMessage. In fact, an array was needed here. Later today I will throw off the code here, what happened. (reply to 3152)

Howard: can use a index to track the length of your mapping? (reply to 3153)

Howard: If the get_value of mapping is null then the that value key didn't in the mapping so you can store it to the mapping and adding in self.index

Howard: @steve_kite I think the latest template of Tact is more difficult to use? How can we put the packed info in here again?

There's no chance of that happening, correct?  - What's the difference between using the Trait from the deployable standard code base (for instance, importing the deployable library by @steve_kite )?   - Does it lead to improved gas efficiency?  https://docs.tact-lang.org/language/libs/ownable

Howard: yeh, followed the first question, I am testing with NFT Staking: Stake NFT then get Jetton Token.  I think using Tact is way more easy to implement those business logic. (reply to 3122)

Hakiem: Hey @howard_peng. For the nft-standard-template, is there a way to deploy the contract without minting the first NFT? I believe 'body' variable in line 12 of contract.deploy.ts contains the bin message to be appended to the deployment link. I've tried replacing "Mint" with an empty string or changing the 'body' variable to be of type string but the transaction always reverts.

Howard: Yes, that was the purpose for people to easily understand the on-chain transaction since you and your users can check on Explore and know that they were sending the transaction with the comment text to mint the NFT.  You can expand the message (TL-B) format based transaction by changing the Tact file, such as coding Transfer as 0x5fcc3d14.  You can also add more receive method functions and call them using self.mint, which is the internal function we have already defined in the code below. (reply to 3225)

Vladimir: Hi friends, üëã  Many of us here are trying to figure out Tact and want to be able to create our own smart contracts. So, I decided to share with you my free course on developing smart contracts in Tact!  The goal is to make entering into the tone of development friendly.  In this course, I've tried to make it as easy as possible to explain all the intricacies I know. We'll start with the basics, from creating and testing a smart contract.   Lesson Titles:   Video 1: Introduction to TON  Video 2: Installing and setting up the development environment, the first smart contract  Video 3: Syntax and data types in Tact  Video 4: Messages between contracts, Throwing Errors  Video 5: TON coin sending, working with gas  Video 6: Syntax and data types in Tact 2  Video 7: Traits.  Video 8: From ERC20 to Jetton.  Video 9: The nft collection contract  Video 10: The first dapp on TON integrated with Telegram  Two lessons have been done so far. And please don't forget to forward this message to friends who also want to start developing on TON. We'll make our community stronger together!

Howard: How can we implement external signing to trigger transactions in Tact? For instance, let's assume I want to send an order or transaction for minting an NFT once a user signs in with their wallet.

Howard: I hate O(log(n)) tho üòµ (reply to 3326)

Howard: Do the mappings in FunC and Tact have the same disadvantages as those in TVM when it comes to sorting values? For example, if I want to build an order-book-based trading system, what would be the best design case for this? Should I structure the order book as an NFT collection, where each OrderID represents an NFT item?  Would that approach help to mitigate the sorting problem and save on gas costs? Even so, we would still need a mapping to store which Int is smaller or larger, right? (I.e., sorting the orders based on an integer value). (reply to 3326)

Howard: Alternatively, following the model used in Ethereum, we could calculate the current order-book situation off-chain, aggregating all the orders later in an off-chain database maybe?

nonam3e: What kind of disadvantages do you mean? You can go through the map from min to max key values using dict_get_min and dict_get_next functions (reply to 3346)

Howard: Don't think it's on Tact yet. And storing value in mapping is gas cost right. (reply to 3348)

nonam3e: You can implement it in tact using native functions (reply to 3349)

Howard: I think I understand what is the advantage for "sharding NFT" in TON compared with Ethereum

Howard: There are many more possibilities for experimenting with NFTs in TVM than with ERC721, because each NFT uses a single address and stores its data (parameters) separately. This is analogous to an isolated position in Perpetual Futures. (reply to 3396)

Howard: Hello everyone, I've shared the repository for the Staking Jetton Example:  1/ For Staking Legic, one of the challenges is learning how to calculate the Jetton Wallet for "each Wallet" that receives the jetton token. Once you understand how to use the "JettonMaster" function from the "ton" SDK, everything becomes much easier.  2/ If you want to list your Jetton token on DEXs like STON.fi or Megaton.fi, remember to launch it using Tact. This is crucial because the initial Jetton code that we write in Tact may differ from FunC. Consequently, you might be "unable" to use the "JettonMaster" function to get the correct jetton wallet address!  3/ Therefore, using the message "AddingJettonAddress" is the recommended way to inject the Jetton Root data into the Staking Contract. I highly recommend launching your jetton token at https://minter.ton.org first, then passing the data to the contract.  Initially, I planned to build the IDO logic in practice, which is why I first built the Staking Contract here to measure the Score.  It's similar to the ve-Curve logic but in a simpler way, as we measure the Size of the Jetton Token you stake, and weight it based on the time you have in the Staking contract.  Then, any contract can call the "GetWeighted" method to fetch the Weight for a user in a message-based way. This approach is more interesting to me than the structures I've seen in Ethereum, and it's an easier way to achieve the same goal.  As you can see in the screenshot, you can test it by transferring different amounts of tokens at various times to obtain different weight results. The diverse design of the Jetton Wallet, where each address stores separate data, allows for greater flexibility in designing your DeFi feature."

Howard: @nonam3e, do you think there's a more gas-efficient way to convert a Boolean to an Integer for concatenation as the index and for storage?   This refers to the topic we discussed earlier.

Andrew: what do you need this for? (reply to 3399)

Howard: Let's say I have a parameter and I want to distinguish whether the order is Long or Short. Would using a Bool be the best option?  Since the same Order_id can definitely have different orders, I need to convert Bool to Integer, then concatenate it for a unique index parameter to create a unique ID. (reply to 3400)

&rey: Couldn't you make all order_ids unique? (reply to 3401)

nonam3e: there might be a better way, I didn't check, but it might work forall X -> int force_cast_to_int(X x) asm "NOP"; @name(force_cast_to_int) native to_int(a: Bool): Int; (reply to 3399)

nonam3e: I checked it and it works as I expected. True value casts to -1 and false casts to 0 (as it should) (reply to 3404)

nonam3e: if you want to cast true value to 1 instead of -1 you may use this: int cast_bool(int x) {     return -x; } @name(cast_bool) native to_int(a: Bool): Int;

&rey: return -x would be better. (reply to 3407)

User<6247944943>: Example, read the Cell you got for the data from the emit log. Then based on the load functions you got in your TS modules you generated. (reply to 3420)

User<6247944943>: btw, https://ton.app/profile/creating seems can't upload the content successfully for weeks.   Please DM me the right person to contact if you know who manage the website. Thanks.

Howard: Oh? MetaMask adding the URL triggered? (reply to 3428)

Howard: I had a issued when dealing multiple Sending at same time. Since my contract will have one in_msg and send the other 3 out_msg.  The third and final one with mode: SendRemainingValue was never success push the message on-chain. Anyone know why?

Howard: I am guessing the SendRemainingValue mode can't measure correctly if I had send the transaction with ton value before.

Nick: Hello everybody, How can I describe struct to deserialise payload:(Either Cell ^Cell)?  I ended up with such solution: payload: Cell?; inlinePayload: Slice as remaining; Are there any other solutions?

Howard: why do you need `inlinePayload: Slice as remaining;` (reply to 3433)

Howard: payload: Cell?; looks correct for me (reply to 3433)

Howard: Hey @steve_kite, is there any plan to implement contract upgrades in Tact?   I want to have my contract audited, but it's too risky to open source it if there's no way to upgrade the contract code. üòµ‚Äçüí´

&rey: You can use @name(set_code) native setContractCode(newCode: Cell); Though there will be no ready tools to maintain even storage compatibility. (reply to 3436)

Howard: do you wanna build the tool for this and apply the grant maybe? (reply to 3437)

Hakiem: @howard_peng, in receive(msg: Transfer) in NftItem contract, should include  require(ctx.sender == self.collection_address || ctx.sender == self.owner, "invalid sender") in order to prevent unauthorized transfers.  https://github.com/howardpen9/nft-standard-template/blob/main/sources/contract.tact

Howard: Hi all, I am testing ctx.value in various cases on the test-net:  As you can see, the value I store in the address changes dynamically even I sent the same amount of TON.   However, since I pass the same value every time, I can't understand why the ctx.value I store fluctuates significantly.  1/ What causes the ctx.value of the unit we store on the contract to be different (i.e., the gas fee for the validator)?  2/ How can I accurately record how much people 'Stake in TON' for this transaction? This could potentially result in high gas costs if the contract logic is complex.  The solution from getgems.io suggests that users pay more TONcoin when they create an auction contract or call the Transfer function.

nonam3e: You should use mode SendPayGasSeparately to send the exact value (reply to 3445)

nonam3e: I got a problem while testing a contract using tact-emulator, max comment size is 123 chars, or idk, maybe because of using StringBuilder, but comment can be larger and the remaining part of the message that can't be stored in the slice should be contained in another cell

Howard: Can we integrate "External Messages" to trigger contracts with FunC functions in Tact?  "I want to be able to execute this kind of transaction, which allows a smart contract to process transactions upon receiving off-chain messages."  like this 0x67df1781

&rey: External message cannot be sent by other contract. (reply to 3469)

&rey: Although, if you are trying to process external messages sent to your contract, Tact has external(msg: ...) handlers.

Howard: I thought we didn't integrate this yet.

User<5818417486>: Ola (reply to 3445)

&rey: External messages have to be enabled in the project config. (reply to 3472)

Howard: yes (reply to 3474)

Nick: It may worth to add a modifier "readonly" for contract properties. We can have properties that are configured during initialization but never modified again. We could put all these properties to a separated cell, parse it but never repack it again. Since "packing" a cell is one of the most expensive instruction it can be a reasonable optimization.

Howard: Do you have a screenshot or something (reply to 3589)

&rey: Specify single argument with init struct. (reply to 3586)

Nick: Yeah (reply to 3591)

Nick: By the way, what do you think about introducing a flag for disabling initOf and system-cell functionality?

Gunnar: Hmm, I have a map<address, ...> And would like to send a message to each address. (reply to 3602)

&rey: ü§¶ Maps are often limited in size (for instance, at contract initialization), and the need to iterate over it is quite common. (reply to 3602)

nonam3e: you have to import func functions to your code... and implement dict_get_min for a slice key to func, because it's not implemented in func stdlib (reply to 3603)

Howard: you can choose the "Open Local Link" then it will automatically pop-up with TonKeeper

Howard: If you choose copy the URL yourself, you might failed because seems URL has the size limitation when you paste to your browser! (Had same issued before)

Hakiem: I used open local link and open the url that prints on the terminal which opens tonkeeper. but now tonkeeper just show 'loading' indefinitely

Hakiem: is there a max size of a contract init state that can be deployed?

Howard: One intriguing question arises: suppose I have more than 5, or even 10 contracts, triggered by an external message simultaneously (at the same Logical Time) and they all send transactions to a single contract.  In theory, these transactions should be able to be sent at the same time, correct?   But how can I inform the receiving contract (Contract A in this scenario) when all the incoming transactions are completed?   Would this be achieved by uploading the query_id?

Howard: To be more specific, let's say I am designing Vaults that will aggregate funds, but only from the Vaults that I trigger, into a single contract before proceeding to the next step.  Key issues: 1/ For ContractA, how can it determine when to execute the next step? Since it doesn't know how many contracts will send transactions to it.  2/ Even if "we, as admins," send external messages to those contracts (1,2,3), how can we be certain that those transactions will arrive at Contract A simultaneously? (reply to 3641)

Daniil: What do you want to achieve exactly? (reply to 3643)

nonam3e: haven't seen docs about it. Tact generates special get_method supported_interfaces that looks like _ supported_interfaces() method_id {     return (         "org.ton.introspection.v0"H >> 128,         "org.ton.abi.ipfs.v0"H >> 128,         "org.ton.deploy.lazy.v0"H >> 128,         "org.ton.chain.workchain.v0"H >> 128     ); } It could help to exactly understand the interface of communication with the contract. Haven't seen someone supported it, but it looks like a nice feature. When you add @interface("org.aboba.v1337") the hash of the string inside brackets will be added to the tuple that supported_interfaces get method returns (reply to 3715)

nonam3e: Also you may deploy jetton wallet, where master address is a treasure, and then send TokenTransferInternal messages from treasure to deployed jetton wallets. But it's better to write your own jetton root, you'll have to use it anyway (reply to 3720)

Howard: Noticed some high-level usage like: Debug, Masterchain, and External Message can't implement on the current version of Blueprint.   - Who assisted with the integration of Tact into Blueprint? - What is the process for Blueprint to incorporate these features? (I've observed that the maintainer is currently focused on FunC within Blueprint.)

Anthony: @Narek @krigga (reply to 3746)

Daniil: why do you think you can't use these features? debug logs are printed in sandbox, external messages can be sent without problems. you can use masterchain too (reply to 3746)

nonam3e: There's no tact.config.json file in blueprint or its alternative (reply to 3748)

Daniil: anyway I think it's better to use the tact-native tools rather than blueprint (for tact development)

Howard: Oh, okay. That's also a good point. However, since more content will be generated for Tact, I believe it's important to highlight the version of Tact we're using and continuously update it. (reply to 3750)

Max: debug is possible, other things might be too tact project config is located in .compile.ts but this requires latest version of bp (check npm to know what it is) (reply to 3746)

Dario: to force increase seqno and make old signature not valid anymore (reply to 3756)

User<6247944943>: I like this answer! (reply to 3757)

&rey: 0. commit() assures that set_data will have effect even if the transaction fails. 1. If we accept external message but don't commit, then execution failure will lead to contract state not being changed, and the external message will be run (and accepted) again and again ‚Äî probably, until the contract runs out of balance. 2. Wallets are especially prone to failures: insufficient balance, invalid destination address, etc. (reply to 3756)

Roman: Hi people! Probably for this question I will be pelted with pissing rags, but I still dare to ask, because it's time to seriously play Tact.  Actually the question is that, as I understand it, the most reasonable way to test now is a blueprint (or a sandbox, it's not so important), which is written in the documentation (https://docs.tact-lang.org/tools/typescript).  The fact is that as a result of compilation .ts file appears (which, according to the documentation, should be used in sandbox) and it uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-core And sandbox https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core is used  So the question is, how do you, colleagues, test? Do you rewirite imports by your hands? What is the fundamental difference either? How is it all brought to a single interface?

Daniil: There are native tools for testing tact smart contracts (reply to 3795)

Roman: You mean this one?   https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-emulator (reply to 3796)

Daniil: Yes (reply to 3797)

Daniil: You can use blueprint too but the project itself should also be created with it

Roman: Yea, I got it, but still, if we are talking about using sandbox as a main testing framework, how to solve the differences between libs? There's no valid way? (reply to 3798)

Daniil: If you created project via blueprint it uses sandbox by default (reply to 3800)

Roman: Yes, but my question is not about sandbox. Question about ton-core) If you compile .tact it will create sample_Contract.ts file, which will import     TupleBuilder,     DictionaryValue } from 'ton-core';  but sandbox works on @ton/core  It's two different libs. So it's impossible to use this .ts file in sandbox without fixind lib by hands (its not really good, cuz after build it always needs to be fixed and there is no garantee that interfaces of libs always be the same)  In the Tact docs, it's written that I can use this file with sandbox. So, the question is how? ) (reply to 3801)

Daniil: Ton-core just migrated to @ton/core

Daniil: These are the same libraries and tact will hopefully update the dependencies to @ton/core soon

Roman: Hmm, that's weird, since the libraries are updated independently to this day. However, it turns out the only way to get started is to change the lib manually after each build, right? (well, or write an alias) (reply to 3803)

Ivan: Hello guys.  1) How can I do Factory smart-contract, maybe you have example? 2) How can I store an array of addresses of new contracts?

nonam3e: 1) here's an example of deploying new contracts https://github.com/nonam3e/tact-lessons/blob/main/lesson5/sources/master.tact#L35-L52 2) you may store it in the map structure (reply to 3806)

Howard: did anyone got ‚ùåFailed Action Phase üì®: (exit_code 40) before?    Never got this before.

nonam3e: It's not a standard error, you should find what it means in the code of the contract (reply to 3889)

Howard: Especially, the error in TonViewer is exit code 0.  As you can see, the error comes from 0x178d4519, the standard Jetton Token's TokenInternalTransfer method.  I have dealt with Jetton before, so the code I used is the same as the code I used previously.  Potential ideas: 1/ Because I am using the TonKeeper UI, the forward_ton_amount is less than the code.   Since the Tact code pays higher gas than FunC's Jetton Token?  2/ (Still thinking and trying to find why...)

Slava: can we set a custom action phase exit code? (reply to 3890)

Howard: True, but I can't find exit code 40 in my output file.  Alternatively, 2) ton.cx may have given me the wrong information. There is no exit code 40, never ever. But on the flip side, ExitCode: 0 on TonViewer is also not that helpful for me to navigate.

Mikhail: Is there a way to create a function inside struct in tact?  trying to make like:  struct A { i: Int;  fn doSmth(self: Self) {} // error here }

&rey: extend fn doSmth(self: A, ...) {}

Mikhail: thanks ! (reply to 4006)

Mikhail: it's should be places not inside contract and struct? right between like global function?? (reply to 4006)

Mikhail: ty

Mikhail: I am also wondering what i should do if i want to make smth like:  Struct A {   id: Int;   value: Int;   someAdr: Address?;  } extends fun doSmth(self: A, caller: Address) {     self.someAdr = caller; }  message MyMsg{   id: Int; }   contract SomeContract {     someMap: map<Int, A>          receive(msg: MyMsg) {      let context = context();      let sender = context.sender;     let receivedStruct = someMap.get(msg.id).doSmth(context.sender): // error right here Invalid     type "A?" for function call  } }

Mikhail: I'm using Unwrap() and bindings in rust, but how can i do the same thing in tact?

&rey: a.unwrap() is a!!.

Mikhail: so i should create a binding that will "unwrap" my struct and then just re-write it in map? (reply to 4012)

&rey: 1. someMap.get(msg.id) returns A? == Option<A>

Mikhail: ok, that basically the same i did in Near, thanks a lot!

Mikhail: Static function "sha256" does not exist, Any suggestions?

Alexander: Does tact have a [] operator for maps? And what happens if such a key does not exist?

Mikhail: it's will return null. no operators, maps only (reply to 4018)

Howard: Then will get null value if the key is not exist (reply to 4018)

Alexander: It means, that map[...] returns an optinal type or it's like "unsafe null"? (reply to 4020)

Mikhail: Do i need to import something for using sha256? (reply to 4017)

Mikhail: its will return "type?" (reply to 4021)

Alexander: value of type

Mikhail: not really, if you store for example mapping of structs it's will return "struct?" type

Mikhail: basically that's the same as Option<struct>

Mikhail: there will be some value or just null

Mikhail: Guys, do you have problem with calling sha256 in tact? in my case it's saying: Static function "sha256" does not exist

Howard: In light of the increasing number of people joining Tact recently, I want to share with you all the Jetton Staking POC here: https://github.com/howardpen9/staking-in-tact  - Basically, you can set a Jetton Root as the capable token contract for this. - You can check the ratio of the staking record for each depositor.

Alexander: Why tact need RUNVM for init?

‚Äî 2023-09-04 ‚Äî

Howard: Great question!  1/ I have set a receive function to inject it. We can only know the "current Staking contract's Jetton Wallet Address" after the Staking contract has been deployed.  2/ The second point is that this approach can prevent front-running. People who want to deposit tokens into the contract could otherwise track the deployer's transactions to gain an advantage.

Alexander: How is the Slice size calculated in this example? It is used further as a signature, I can assume 512 bits. But how is the size determined by the compiler?

Nick: The example is focused on building the message, but not reading. (reply to 4180)

Howard: The data usability is rely on onchain messages passing from other contracts.

User<5660798371>: What conclusion can be drawn from this?

&rey: Each TON transaction requires data of one contract only so to interact with other contracts in any way you have to send messages. (reply to 4215)

Kon: you have to send to back a message and all, it will bind contracts (reply to 4215)

Kon: A contract sends M1 to B, B sends M2 to A contract

User<5660798371>: This is simple logic, but I'd like to dispense with unnecessary transfer:  1) A sends M1 a message checking a condition in B's contract 2) M1 sends a message to M2 (reply to 4218)

Kon: to check condition, need to have some "receive" method in B contract that will send the result to A, then A will send M2. You can't just receive data from B contract in the same method on A contract, because TON is the asynchronous blockchain

Rocky: Hi all , i want to other help ,   if there's any chance to change a  solidity contract to tact contract or ton contract .

Vlad: Unfortunately, no for now (reply to 4307)

Vlad: Is there an analogue of FunC function store_dict() in tact?

&rey: Even if there is not, you can use @name(store_dict) native fun storeDict(...) (reply to 4311)

Vlad: I was implementing it via: storeUint(1, 1).storeRef(self.nftItemCode) (reply to 4312)

Vlad: hm, get such error:    Type "Builder" does not have a function named "storeDict"

Vlad: @name(store_dict) native storeDict(b: Builder, c: Cell): Builder;

&rey: Have you converted Map<_, _> to Cell? (reply to 4315)

Vlad: Well, I don't use any maps

Vlad: should it be the map?

&rey: No, not necessarily. (reply to 4318)

Mikhail: not really what i meant to, i mean like calling it from frontend, like im calling ethers in ethereum (reply to 4352)

Mikhail: because right now i am testing contract just by writing tests in IDE

Mikhail: I am also wondering is there are any methods like map.clear()? how do i clear the map?

Mikhail: Thanks! just figured that i can use clearmap() (reply to 4362)

Mikhail: https://github.com/ton-core/ton/issues/11  Is there are any ways to return a struct contains maps?

Rocky: I can use the TON Center API, but the bot is not working

Alex: You can use https://www.orbs.com/ton-access/ to connect with Tonceter. (reply to 4379)

Vlad: Does anyone has examples of working with maps?

Vlad: Docs have 0 info

Vlad: Also noticed an interesting thing: structs are transformed into Cell with refs when you use .toCell()

Vlad: So they don‚Äôt care about the fields‚Äô names

&rey: This is issue with Fift. Is everything up-to-date?

Mikhail: yep, should be, yesterday everything was fine, i even didn't changed code

&rey: The likely reason for this issue is that code doesn't fit into cell. You may have to rearrange some functions for everything to compile correctly. By the way, does battle have 257-bit int keys, or they could be shortened? (reply to 4403)

Mikhail: –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω—è–ª) (reply to 4404)

&rey: Possible solutions for your problem: 1. Change order of your functions and if-s where possible; 2. Make key length in map<Int, Battle> more specific, like map<Int as uint64, Battle>. (reply to 4405)

Mikhail: already put all possible specifications for variable types (reply to 4406)

Mikhail: changing order like really copy-paste in different part of the code ?)

Mikhail: @pcrafter looks like it didn't helped at all, the only solutions is to commend this function. With this function Commented everything works fine.

Howard: Would be happy to try out with the full code. (reply to 4409)

Howard: Hi everyone, I've just updated my Jetton Token repo:  - It now supports Comment during transfers, similar to the feature available on TonKeeper.  - I've included a max_supply field in my template, as it seems to be important in most cases. This is also emphasized by https://minter.ton.org/.  - I've added instructions for generating a Transfer URL when you're trying to send the Jetton Token to a third person. (In Jetton, if you want to transfer your Jetton Token to someone, you need to send a message to YOUR Jetton Wallet, not to the new recipient's wallet.)  - forward_ton_amount can be set as lower as possible: Same as TelemintNFT. I don't know why, but looks like we can set (1e-9 TON) in forward_ton_amount without any error.   https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact

Vlad: Didn‚Äôt get the tip about url (reply to 4411)

Vlad: What‚Äôs the difference between native throw and require?

Vlad: It should be:  extends native storeDict(‚Ä¶) (reply to 4339)

Howard: throw seems the style from FunC, I can't sure the difference in details like gas cost...etc. But I prefer require for sure.. (reply to 4413)

Vlad: Same here (reply to 4415)

Vlad: Btw, noticed that there is no way to serialise a dictionary in tact

Vlad: Maps are also converted in a cell with ordered data

Vlad: Slices and cells go as refs, other like bits

Vlad: I wonder how to make an onchain collection compatible with marketplaces then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Vlad: Submitted the issue on GitHub

Mikhail: About this error:  Seem's like i used the whole possible limitation for contract size, cause it's have embeded structs. The solution was:  To create your own "bicycle" by using booleans and other low-cost data types for representation for some data. For example i was developing a small game on TON and the struct has tons of fields, some of theme were like firstPlayer: Address, secondPlayer: Address,  winner: Address?;  Seems like i used to many bytes, so i changed "winner" field to "bool" type where "true" - firstPlayer, and "false" means secondPlayer (reply to 4410)

Mikhail: Never seen any limitations about max data stored in contract. That's weird :) I thought i just will pay a little bigger number for storage when deploying.

Vlad: It also exists in Evm, I remember that you can‚Äôt pay more than 1 ETH in gas

Vlad: I think it‚Äôs the limitations of blueprint, maybe you can try another way to deploy (reply to 4423)

Mikhail: idk what function you must call to pay 1 eth in gas XD (reply to 4424)

Vlad: I did an audit and saw people putting whitelist as an array

Vlad: If you put more than ~ 1000 addresses it will cost more) (reply to 4426)

Daniil: How many items do you have in map? (reply to 4423)

Mikhail: doesnt mattep, it's even didn't compile so there was zero items (reply to 4429)

Mikhail: not runtime error, could not be compiled

Daniil: Can you show the error? (reply to 4431)

Mikhail: /

Mikhail: TUPLE:integer does not fit into cell  Any suggestions? (forwarded from Mikhail)

Mikhail: Problem accure here:  battles: map<Int, Battle>;    get fun getBattleData(id: Int): Battle {         return self.battles.get(id)!!;     } (reply to 4434) (forwarded from Mikhail)

Daniil: I‚Äôm sure the problem is in the tact compiler. You can try creating an issue on GitHub (reply to 4434)

Mikhail: but as after some detective series, the problem has been solved by decreasing amount of data stored in embeded struct

&rey: Yes, because this changed instructions to load it and, in turn, function compiled successfully. (reply to 4437)

&rey: Limit is 65536 cells. (reply to 4423)

Mikhail: then it was not really correct error desctiption by the compiler (reply to 4438)

&rey: *in Fift compiler. Tact is only responsible insofar it chooses its version and contents of Asm.fif. (reply to 4436)

&rey: It failed to put code into current cell and somewhy not proceeded by writing it to ref. Maybe also limit of 256 cells in depth was reached. (reply to 4440)

Vlad: Can you give more background (reply to 4478)

Jamie: I have this line of code in my .tact file:    emit(GameResult{winner: winnerAddree, randomResult: random}.toCell()); (reply to 4479)

Jamie: I just want to know how to get this message after I call the smart contract from my test.ts

Vlad: Do you use blueprint?

Jamie: yes

Jamie: I am using blueprint

Vlad: What is the emit function?

Vlad: If you wanna see the messages in tests, just take the instance of your send request and access the transactions or events property

Jamie: https://tact-by-example.org/03-emit (reply to 4485)

Vlad: Hm, strange that it‚Äôs not in the docs (reply to 4487)

Vlad: Anyway: const depositMessage = await nexton.send(....  console.log(await depositMessage.events);

Howard: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/non-bouncable-messages (reply to 4460)

Mario: I think there's a version mismatch for unit testing. @tact-lang/coverage has @ton/core as peerDependency, but the latest compiler outputs a TS file with ton-core

Mario: which results in Jest not working properly

Mario: same for @tact-lang/emulator which relies on @ton/core, but the generated code from compiler has incompatible types, because it relies on ton-core

Mario: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact-emulator/commit/771a9550c28ef8d73a85243de1fd2a30fe6d7c01 This is a breaking change and has been published in a patch

Mario: same for this https://github.com/tact-lang/ton-coverage/commit/1dcae81942e54b98fb14f251643f015b26e4a3e7

Alexander: Hi guys! I found a possible bug in this Tact example from https://tact-by-example.org/06-authenticating-children  This chapter is dedicated to children contract authentification by it's address to make children impersonation impossible. However, children constructor doesn't check that parent address passed as an argument is really a message sender:     init(parent: Address, seqno: Int) {         self.parent = parent;         self.seqno = seqno;     }  With this code we can create a child from another parent contract and pass Victim parent address as an argument. Using self.parent = sender() is not an option as it won't affect child address this way. We can add require(parent == sender() ) to make it secure.  Did I get it right or there's something I've missed?

Howard: Good catch! I can help fix this. Thank you.  Correct. If we want to filter specific senders, then adding that line is a reasonable choice. (reply to 4509)

Howard: https://github.com/nonam3e/tact-lessons/tree/main/lesson5

Then, set the remaining TonCoin value to pass the message and trigger the emit event from the current Smart Contract address.   The method 1 will failed, but nor method 2.

&rey: I don't think there is "objectlively right" naming convention, and I think that it should rather follow convention of dApp language. (reply to 4775)

Jeff: We are using tact. But you mean it's our choice?

&rey: Yes; I think it's better to match JS/Python/whatever you use for interaction with smart contract.

Howard: try invoice.amount!! (reply to 4822)

Howard: Since your Invoice data type has a ? mark, you need to inherently add !! to any data field when you use it. (reply to 4822)

Hakiem: Hi, I have a few questions regarding Jetton contract in Tact https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact/blob/new_/sources/contract.tact.  For this portion of the TokenTransferInternal message:           // 0x7362d09c - notify the new owner of JettonToken that the transfer is complete         if (msg.forward_ton_amount > 0) {              send(SendParameters{                 to: self.owner,                 value: msg.forward_ton_amount,                 mode: SendPayGasSeparately + SendIgnoreErrors,                 bounce: false,                 body: TokenNotification {                     queryId: msg.queryId,                     amount: msg.amount,                     from: msg.from,                     forward_payload: msg.forward_payload                 }.toCell()             });         }  1) Is this used to trigger additional logic in the owner contract upon receiving jettons? 2) Is it possible to send other parameters in the TokenNotification message as per this standard? Maybe in forwardPayload? (idk what this param is for tbh) 3) If this is the case, how much forward_ton_amount is set conventionally? Is 1 nanoton enough just so that this code is triggered?

Howard: Great questions!  1/ The forward_ton_amount in text refers to "the amount of TonCoin you want to allocate for this TokenNotification messages."  This message format is required to notify the original owner that "He has transferred a certain amount of Jetton to someone."  2/ Correct. You can input whatever you desire, regardless of the parameters you wish to pass. On DeDust.io, the text message is displayed to notify everyone at the explorer level that this Tx is for adding Liquidity, Exit, Swap, etc.  3/ It depends on the action you want the receiver contract to perform. For a standard Transfer reminder in message passing, 10^-9 TonCoin is acceptable. (reply to 4862)

Ahmet Said: this deploy script works ? https://docs.tact-lang.org/start/deploy#deploying-with-typescript-and-deploy-link-1

Pie: Yes it works once you set up ts-node or Bun runtime. (reply to 4865)

Ahmet Said: so this line works out of async-await block? let init =  await SampleTactContract.init(owner); (reply to 4866)

Hakiem: Oooo thanks! Very interesting mechanism. I was stuck trying to figure out how a contract can trigger a transfer of jettons since there's no transferFrom() and allowances. I guess the transfer happens first which then triggers the subsequent logic. A few other things:  1) for (2) are you referring to inputting into the forward_payload? 2) if so, how would I input a cell containing for example an address and an int? 3) and how would I validate (in the owner contract) that the payload contains the correct number of inputs and are of the correct types? (reply to 4863)

Daniil: 3) however, if you want to start up TVM in order to process something on the other side, you need to attach at least 0.0001 TON. And if the receiving contract doesn't call "accept_message", you'll need to attach even more to cover gas fees (reply to 4863)

Vivi: Why it was falseÔºü

pizza-777: I think, If the wallet doesn't exist and bounce:true the message can be bounced and wallet will not deployed. So the bounce:false param is for replenish and deploy wallet before. (reply to 4870)

lanford: Is it possible to use asm instruction in Tact? For example: func int are_slices_equal_2? (slice a, slice b) asm "SDEQ"; This funC snippet used asm "SDEQ", I'm wondering whether Tact can also do this or not

Daniil: You can import func functions into tact. By the way, what‚Äôs the use case? Your feedback may help in Tact development (reply to 4873)

Howard: Hi, this is a really tough question: "How can I make the current smart contract I've built understand if the sender is the correct NFT item from a specific NFT collection I'm targeting?"  1. In the past, if I deployed the NFT collection simultaneously, it was straightforward. This is because I knew how to calculate each NFT item's address within the smart contract.  2. The issue arises when an NFT item is transferred. It doesn't convey useful information in a consistent manner. This means the contract simply receives OwnershipAssigned(0x05138d91) and can't determine if it's the desired NFT item or not. (neither which the NFT Item is down below in one Specific Collection or not)

Hakiem: Hey guys, bumping this message:  1) how do I input a cell containing address an int in the forward_payload field (Slice) of TokeNotification in  the TokenTransferInternal message for Jetton? 2) how can i validate that the payload (Slice) contains the address and the int? (reply to 4868)

Vlad: Just create it: beginCell()‚Ä¶ (reply to 5181)

Vlad: For checking there are methods  like sliceBits, sliceRefs, preload uint‚Ä¶

Hakiem: In https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact/blob/main/sources/message.tact,  TokenTransfer message has a custom_payload (Cell) which is not used in the receiver for JettonDefaultWallet. What is this for?

Hakiem: forwardPayload in TokenTransfer is of type "Slice as remaining" but in my test file the input must be of type cell. is this correct? And what is this "Slice as remaining" type? (reply to 5189)

Vlad: Hm, payload should be a cell for sure (reply to 5193)

Alex: gmgm

Howard: I want to checking whether it's sender is one of the NFT item addresses or not. (reply to 5337)

&rey: You have to calculate StateInit cell manually, but you can. (reply to 5337)

Howard: probably no? Because even I wrote the same functions like the Collection I want to support in my current contract, the code of the StateInit in cell is still different. (reply to 5340)

&rey: You need to use beginCell().storeUint(6, 5).storeRef(actual_nft_item_code).storeRef(nft_item_data).endCell() instead of initOf(...). (reply to 5346)

Gazozz: GM everyone

&rey: You can find those on ton.org/. (reply to 5529)

Howard: Tact Contest! (reply to 5529)

Howard: I am checking the small amount transfer message, will get this exit code -14 in general. Although it's not a big deal (since the address still receive the funds), does anyone know how to pass this issued?

Daniil: It‚Äôs ‚Äúnot enough gas‚Äù (reply to 5598)

Howard: But even tho my contract is set like this, which is "receive the message and do nothing".   It is still will have this error? Sounds wired. (reply to 5602)

&rey: It does so many checks that it's not surprising. (reply to 5603)

&rey: *Tact does (reply to 5604)

Daniil: Starting up TVM costs 0.0001 ton, and since you have several ‚Äúreceivers‚Äù, there is also some code to be executed (reply to 5603)

Howard: Wait, 1. I thought those receive functions don't affect each other?  2. Why do multiple receive functions increase the gas cost, even when I specify that each receive function is targeting a different use case?   (One is for message Slice, one is for message that is "text" string message) (reply to 5606)

Daniil: Because after the compilation, TVM smart contract has only one ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù function for internal messages which is recv_internal. And when you define several receivers in Tact, they all are just being compiled into a bunch of if-else‚Äôs. (reply to 5607)

Howard: Right, got it.  Is that why the syntax of FunC is only based on two sides: recv_internal and recv_external? (reply to 5608)

Daniil: Yes, right. You can define more functions in FunC, but the incoming message only triggers one of these two (reply to 5609)

Howard: 1. Does FunC also have the same effect that "more receive methods lead to higher gas costs when receiving messages"?    This is super super interesting.  2. I am just testing and trying to write a smart contract that will pass all received messages (Slice, String, null OP, etc.) to the owner's address!   Then this contract should have a standardized contract that I can implement tho.

Daniil: 1. If you write more if-else‚Äôs, yes, it‚Äôll cost more gas to execute.  2. Then why do you even need to split these receivers into a several different ones? Just do receive(){‚Ä¶} (reply to 5611)

Howard: 1/ I think from my knowledge in FunC, the sentence should more specific that "Adding more receive method in Tact is more like adding more if-else‚Äôs in FunC. Yes, it‚Äôll cost more gas to execute.   2/ I thought receive(msg: Slice), receive(msg: String), receive() are three different situations. (reply to 5612)

Daniil: 2) these are different situations, but you can handle them all using the last one if I‚Äôm not mistaken (reply to 5617)

&rey: 2. Isn't receive(msg: Slice) {} sufficient for forwarding everything? (reply to 5611)

‘º÷á’∏’∂ | Brgndy: What could be the reason?

Howard: can't sure (reply to 5622)

Ken: test

Howard: üëã (reply to 5651)

Ken: I'm struggling to understand the storage limitations.  1/ If I have a map<Int, Int>, can it grow indefinitely? 2/ If I have a map<Int, struct> and the struct is passed in as a message, can it grow indefinitely?

Daniil: Storage limit currently is around 30k keys for the whole contract. Also remember that the more keys you have in a map, the more costly is to operate with it. (reply to 5654)

Daniil: That‚Äôs why in TON we often use parent->child smart contract architecture where instead of a big map you deploy separate child smart contracts for each entry. This approach can be a bit harder to implement but it can scale.

Ken: If the value is a tact struct (so another cell) it would use additional smart contract storage? Would it save space if the message takes a ref instead?

Mario: Hey, can someone point me to an up to date example of how to do Jetton token testing for an e.g. DEX or any other smart contract that can receive Jettons?

Howard: https://github.com/howardpen9/staking-in-tact  ICO Example: https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact#-smart-contracts-examples (reply to 5661)

‚Äî 2023-10-12 ‚Äî

Vlad: They are all compiled into 1 receive_internal function (reply to 5607)

Vlad: All cells are still stored in the contract, manipulation with refs can only make it less or more efficient (reply to 5658)

Howard: yeh, that make sense, since Tact is pre-compile before FunC. (reply to 5692)

Howard: What do you mean "manipulation with refs can only make it more efficient"? (reply to 5693)

Vlad: I mean the contract execution (reading this map) (reply to 5695)

&rey: Yes, if Tact compiled into TVM bytecode directly, it could use opcodes to index functions in contract...

FxCryptoUz: Which programming language will be used?

FxCryptoUz: In this competition

Mario: Ok thx. How would I load an array? (reply to 6033)

Mario: I have another question. I am receiving an error on my test: Trying to run get method on non-active contract        1022 |     async getGetWalletData(provider: ContractProvider) {       1023 |         let builder = new TupleBuilder();     > 1024 |         let source = (await provider.get('get_wallet_data', builder.build())).stack;  In this line: https://github.com/Tarnadas/orderly-ton-amm/blob/master/tests/OrderlyAmm.spec.ts#L172  I'm trying to build integration tests, so trying to mock as few as possible. I used Jetton Tact reference implementation to deploy JettonMaster in my test.  From my understanding this should output the same address, but it doesnt: console.log('ownerJettonA', ownerJettonA.address); console.log('await tokenA.getGetWalletAddress(owner.address)', await tokenA.getGetWalletAddress(owner.address));   So I assume this is the reason why I receive this error. Does anyone have an idea what's going wrong?  Also do I really need the Jetton reference implementation? Could I do this with the JettonMaster from ton library without relying on my own test Jetton code?

Howard: Trying to run get method on non-active contract  means your contract didn't deployed properly. Pause/fallback in the middle I think.   Better to check the contract code, or deploy on test-net to find the exit code and see which contract failed to reply (reply to 6038)

Duck Pepe: are the tasks going to be published in a public repository today?

Heydar: so it's a linked list(with just forward iterations) and have variant of types so it seems like storing all data in array of bits , and third variable present what is saved from to bits ... is that right? if it's right  what's the location meaning? do we have any example of using the slice? to better understand, Im beginner.

Heydar: I mean another variable in underhood. (or in our mind , when sending bits or receiving) (reply to 6889)

Ahmet Said: why getting this error ? error: previous function return type ((slice, int, int, slice, slice, int), int) cannot be unified with implicit end-of-block return type (): cannot unify type () with ((slice, int, int, slice, slice, int), int) theres something wrong with getter functions in func compiling?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Hmmmmm let‚Äôs start again.  Let‚Äôs say you have 1000bits. In Cell. You can read them ‚Äúforward only‚Äù, so you start by making Slice from Cell. This Slice points to first bit of 1000. You can read 32 bits as int or ‚Äúseveral bits‚Äù as Address (address size can vary). You must know what was stored to read correctly. If it was stored as uint256 but you read it as uint32‚Ä¶ you will receive wrong value.  So once your read,say, 32 bits - your slice ‚Äúpointer‚Äù moved forward and you have 1000-32 bits remaining (reply to 6890)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: That‚Äôs why TL-B schemas are important - they describe what is contained inside cells and how many bits it occupies

Heydar: Got it perfect. thanks. thank you very much (reply to 6896)

TokenNotification: - if nessage is not from A or B throw an error - if sender is admin - just update incoming token balance - calculate swap price (as per spec) if it is greater than dest token balance - send incoming tokens back to prev owner - otherwise send dest tokens to owner - update balances accordingly

Should it be in the same way as regular transfer?  -What is the correct formula for the price? If I use your formula "amountOfJettonAOnContract * decimal / amountOfJettonBOnContract" then example should give 5 * 10^9. --What should I provide in getter? -Should dex contract return unused gas to user?

Vlad: Just figured out the problem with task 2, it was value and message mode Use the ones as in tact-by example

Vlad: Addresses of wallets (reply to 7290)

Vlad: Messages come from the wallets owned by the dex contract

Vlad: User interacts with his wallet, it sends message to the receiver wallet

Vlad: Price is right, given with decimals (reply to 7290)

Vlad: https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact/blob/main/sources/message.tact  example contracts

&rey: 1. aAmount and bAmount 2. Yes 3. Anything 4. Not stated 5. Not stated 6. According to specification 7. When it receives notification from its own jetton wallet 8. According to specification 9. Invalid jetton allows to simply throw an error, insufficient value to swap requires a refund 10. Indeed, it is 11. The thing from point 10 12. Not quite (reply to 7290)

Heydar: Guys do we have good docs about the compiler's compile flow and any optimization that it doing? or what' the source code of that ?

Luke: Is there anything wrong with this for task5? (this is just a snippet for sending one nft to admin)  send(SendParameters{         to: nft,         value: ton("0.08"),         mode: SendPayGasSeparately,         body: Transfer{           queryId: msg.queryId,           newOwner: self.admin,           responseDestination: self.admin,           forwardAmount: 0,           forwardPayload: emptySlice()         }.toCell()       });  I've been debugging for hours, days even, and im still stuck on 10/11

Vlad: and admin in the third task is the owner, rigth?

calpaliu.eth: I am trying to write the test for task 4, quite interesting

User<6199232976>: 1. How does dex own jettons? 4. In such case dex contracts can't interact with these wallets. If we use wallet from stdlib. 5. Then I can imagine various scenarios and each of them would require different actions  6 and 8. I haven't seen any specifications. 9. It wasn't my question. 10. The price is incorrect or the example is wrong? 11. Should I return the price of one jetton or the price of 10^(-9) jetton? 12. Have I missed another specification? (reply to 7299)

Howard: yeh (reply to 7318)

Vlad: task 4  "- If the smart contract already holds an nft then return the incoming nft back to the sender" So one contract - one nft locked? then, looks like I need to create a bool variable

Vlad: error: previous function return type ((slice, int, int, slice, slice, int), int) cannot be unified with implicit end-of-block return type (): cannot unify type () with ((slice, int, int, slice, slice, int), int)

Vlad: What‚Äôs the reason of this error?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Yes, one contract - one locked nft (reply to 7323)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Seems like you missed return or return wrong type (reply to 7326)

Vlad: ok, I checked:  it happens when get method returns only under if statement and does nothing out of it (reply to 7327)

Vlad: so, there are occasions when it returns nothing

Heydar: guys composition is better on Tact or inheritance , I always prefer using composition in c++. (for some reasons) but in Tact I want to know which one reduce gas fee ?

Howard: We still have 3 days away with the Tact SmartContract Contest deadline! (reply to 6074)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: correction: one contract = one nft at some moment in time. after contract unlocked and returned nft - it can accept/lock new one (reply to 7323)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: i use mode = 0 (not sure it important)  and add customPayload=null (compiler throws " Missing fields "customPayload" in type Transfer" without it), but other seems fine (reply to 7302)

Vlad: taks 4: message NftWithdrawal {   queryId: Int as uint64;   nftAddress: Address; }  why do we have address of nft in the incoming message, should i check it matches the stored nft?

Vlad: since I have only one nft stored and know it's address (reply to 7339)

/B4ckSl4sh\: github canceled it

Sasha: Is it possible for contract to call itself? For example in 5th task looks like we can't withdraw all nfts with one tx and need to init a new one

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: the only way of "calling" in TON is messages (reply to 7343)

Heydar: what do you mean call itself? do you mean re-construct that? or sending a message? (reply to 7343)

Sasha: Send a message (reply to 7345)

Heydar: guys how many level can use traits (inheritance)?

Heydar: what do you do in that message receiver? move the behavior in a method and add the method in that message receiver , then call the method of itself anywhere in your contract. (reply to 7346)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: sure. contract can send message to anybody, including himself (reply to 7346)

Railgun: Hello, do we need to create test cases on our own?

Heydar: calling the function is cheaper than executing the message receiver. (reply to 7349)

Sasha: As I understand there is a limit for messages you can send in one receiver (reply to 7351)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: yes, but they are different.  for example, shouting aloud is cheaper than calling by phone, but sometimes you are too far and the only way to talk is to call (reply to 7351)

Heydar: not just that , if you think about the underhood, they implemented a map<string, messagReceiverFunction> and then it should use log(n)*len(yourString) to execute your messageRceiverFunction, in best case it's hash not map, but when your  using the function , you  just call the function address ... I think this is one of the reasons . and another one is that you said limiting ... also we have more too. and Im not sure that when you doing message to yourself how much cost vs using sendMessage (reply to 7352)

Vlad: Wow, that‚Äôs interesting (reply to 7349)

Heydar: your right , but when you are in your scope(contract class) why using send to yourself, while it's possible just call your method üòê (reply to 7353)

Heydar: calling method just calling the function address. message should send that via protocol and etc tasks.

Vlad: task 4  "send the locked nft back to the owner with all the remaining TON balance"

Heydar: is that right?  Im just guessing , Im just beginner.

Heydar: I consider that is using protobuf and something like grpc so sending message vs just calling the method there is very cheaper than parsing message , and finding correspond function then call. (reply to 7360)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: the answer is in one of 10 previous messages above your question :) (reply to 7359)

Vlad: remaining ton balance means balance of the contract? (reply to 7361)

Heydar: ü§î which? (reply to 7364)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: i'll answer this question in 4 days if you'll still need it :) (reply to 7366)

Heydar: OFC üòç  I definitely want to learn this technology; I've only been at it for 3 days, and there's a long way for me to understand it. üòÅ (reply to 7367)

Sasha: Now its time to understand if it is the right solution for 5th task) (reply to 7349)

Vlad: task 4 time (in a forwardPayload message as uint32) is a period or end time?

Sasha: Any articles about ton gas reduce? Following solidity rules doesn't always help

Vlad: And is it in seconds?   since now() returns seconds (reply to 7371)

Ken: why is build time so long now

Ken: https://xkcd.com/303/

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: In challenge #5, should we use self.profit to record the profit that the admin earns? Or we can simply use myBalance to handle it?

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I think myBalance will be better.   But what if admin directly add nft to the collection with many tons attached?  Should we return the remain ton back to owner?

Mario: how can I print dump and emit messages with blueprint? I tried to set it up like this:         blockchain.verbosity = {             ...blockchain.verbosity,             blockchainLogs: true,             vmLogs: 'vm_logs_full',             debugLogs: true,             print: false,         };  but I am lost in all the logs and can't see the log I'm looking for. For dump I assume I would have to compile the contracts in debug mode, but how to do that with blueprint and no tact.config.json?

Sasha: Does receive action with all code in it cost the same gas as if I will split it on different internal functions?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: no matter what is inside my map - I have two lines that are not related to each other, and swapping their position results in different test result.  literally, saving sender() into some variable before or after calling randomInt makes test pass or fail.  I have two submits of both cases - and one code failed both times, other code succeeded both times. hard to believe that this is related to particular generated values by generator (reply to 7436)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: no, it is (reply to 7463)

Ken: oh thx

Heydar: I thought contracts are like classes , and you can create multiple times of that class. but it seems it's not and each contract is specific and it is an object not class to making instance, am I right?

Ken: Forget about OOP BS (reply to 7466)

Heydar: ok , now each contract we make , is an instance, ok? (reply to 7467)

Heydar: and when we deploy , it will join in the chains?

Ken: yes, each deployed contract is a separate program

Heydar: so if one body from another place in the world write a code in tact that is like our code(exactly his code is look like our code), can he deploy too!?

Ken: If the bytecode + init params is unique

Heydar: but it wont be! (reply to 7472)

Heydar: because the bytecode is same , and anything in his code is same as us.

Heydar: I mean if anybody have a code that is exactly like our code, he cant deploy :/

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: that's why "init data" are used - that's "public key" for wallets, "index" for NFT etc

Heydar: but that means we should add a variable store and more gas just cause of deploying same idea? (reply to 7481)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: how to get coins amount sent by sender() ?

Heydar: guys really I have so many questions , should I ask where these questions ... no answer in the docs ...

Heydar: guys where is the 12-words in this technology , that 12 or 24 words making a hash that is our wallet address?? it means that we can make the address manually when deploying? how?

Heydar: when we want to deploy new contract on the runtime(I mean by another contracts) it should have a value , that means any contract need to have initial ton. so the question is that the root contract that we are creating and want to join in chains , how should give it the money?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: you know number of bits (not cell, but slice - slice.bits(), slice.refs()

Sasha: Make sence ü§î

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: if you switch from TACT to FunC and deep dive into grouping Cells into BoC (Bag of Cells) and serializing BoC into {b5ee9c72...} hex sequence - you will find more interesting case how the length of Cell (0..1023) is stored in only one byte!

Sasha: I will not, accidentally saw contest and decided to try) But thanks (reply to 7590)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: so you don't want to know how to store in one byte (range 0...255) the value (length of data) that may be 0...1023 ? ;) (reply to 7592)

MonoBit: I have 9/10 in task 3 and I have no idea what to do :( any hint please üòî

Vlad: Guys, task 4 is confusing: ‚Äúwith all the remaining TON balance‚Äù but SendRenainingBalance is wrong, use remaining value

Vlad: nfts: map<Int as uint16, Address>; How does it work?

Vlad: 3 days ago it threw me an error: unsupported type for keys

ntly: did you pass test 5 in task 4 with that? (reply to 7605)

Vlad: Yeah (reply to 7608)

MonoBit: I'm still 4/5. This task was so hard for me (reply to 7605)

&rey: You can't store it in variable but can in contract. (reply to 7606)

Nikolay: According to the jetton specification, each user has their own JettonWallet. And we are given only two jettonWallets. And the sender can be either an admin or another user. Which doesn't look like the specification. We don't have a wallet code to get the user's jettonWallet address. Also we have notifications coming from two given jettonWallets. And according to the specification notifications should come from our jettonWallet, and there should be two of them. I calculate the price using this formula. And only 5/10 tests. (reply to 7567)

Vlad: Notification comes from your wallet (reply to 7615)

Nikolay: Yes That's right. I misspoke. But that doesn't change the point. (reply to 7618)

Vlad: Don‚Äôt worry, I am on 1/10 üòÖ

Vlad: task 5, does it mean whole contract balance (without profit) or remaining value from 0.1 ton? " the sender with all remaining balance (except for admin profit = fees collected from this and other swaps)"

Vlad: in task 3 should I update amounts of jettons after the swap?

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: balance - 0.1 - allFees[calculated by contract] (reply to 7622)

–ü–∞–≤–µ–ª: How can I calculate gas usage locally?

Vlad: not all 0.1 ton will be used (reply to 7624)

Vlad: already found the way to send ( my balance - profit) (reply to 7627)

Vlad: task 5 is tricky, the part with sending nft to user, I should delete this nft from map

Yuri: But contract's balance does not increase exactly by 2 in that case (reply to 7628)

Vlad: why? I get 2.sth ton, take 2 and return all other, mode SendIgnore Errors

BrayanD: "but only in case that TON attached is enough to process refund without losing TONs on the SC's balance"  How do I check that the TON attached is enough?

BrayanD: In task #5 should I return 'context().value - ton("2")' to user when swap NFT?

Vlad: hm looks like same as my approach

BrayanD: but I still get 8/11

BrayanD: I tried everything

Heydar: sending init data for each message to the child contract has less cost or saving that id uint32 (or address) in my parent contract?

Railgun: I switched from manual throw on each cases to a top level require and passed the last. (reply to 7604)

Vlad: Do you use throw for message from another Jetton? (reply to 7639)

Vlad: Or you made it with require too?

Railgun: Right now all in require. Only throw when checking address.

Railgun: Send section should only return.

Vlad: What do you throw, when Jetton is wrong? (reply to 7642)

Vlad: just got stuck here too (reply to 7635)

Vlad: check the updates for task 3

Vlad: https://github.com/ton-community/tact-challenge/commit/0badb9d2180017c59c0184007dd0fb9f8e3e4b72

Vlad: In task 3 should I check that amount of jettons is not 0? before devidinng?

Railgun: Yes

Railgun: Dont let divide by zero throw

Railgun: Properly handle it and send back to the  msg.from

Vlad: ok, looks like that is my mistake

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I have been struggling with these challenges for several days, and I want to make sure when we should set messages as bounceable?

Railgun: Some of them wont influence the result. But others do...

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Sure, i have observed this....

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Does anyone here have any summarized experiences? I'm genuinely curious about why this challenge is designed this way.

Grit: ‚ùîHey People! Tact challenge deadline is October 20th, right? Are our scores considered submitted automatically? Or there is some procedure to submitting them? By Automatically I mean if my score is in leader board then it effectively is submitted.

Railgun: Just push and trigger github action. Watch out for your free quota if you are an active developer üòÇ

Grit: What I think is bounce flag is only makes sence when you are going to work with bounced message. So if you don't have bounced method in your contract it's kinda useless (reply to 7658)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: But i passed some testcases just by adding bounce:true (reply to 7664)

Vlad: for which task? (reply to 7665)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Task 4 and 5

Vlad: did you pass all tests in 5? (reply to 7667)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Nope, currently 10/11

9: 9/11 :(

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: But i pass challenge #4 by simply setting bounce to true. (4/5 -> 5/5)

Vlad: and what to do with getter? return 0? (reply to 7654)

Vincent: Can someone help me explain how to determine the type of Jetten here? Or did something go wrong there?

Vincent: The sender cannot directly judge and cannot get the master of jettonwallet. Is there any problem?

Heydar: guys where is explaination about nft in tact by example ... need some example?

Vlad: you don't need to interact with master (reply to 7675)

Vlad: check this git https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact/blob/main/sources/message.tact (reply to 7676)

Vincent: I know, but how do I know if I need to increase aAmount or bAmount?

Vlad: you check from which wallet the jettons came (reply to 7679)

Andy: I checked the source code of Tact, and it seems that bounce is true by default... This task 4 test 5 is such a mystery üßê (reply to 7671)

Vincent: What do you mean? Would you mind clarifying? The source address that can be obtained so far is ctx.sender, but it is a jettonwallet address and cannot be compared with the jetton address in the initialization (reply to 7680)

Heydar: actually jetton is nft?! (reply to 7678)

Vlad: no he has a repo for nfts (reply to 7685)

Heydar: it's weird why we have not example of that in tact-by-example then (reply to 7686)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: We have fully documented the nft collection and nft item standard in our project  https://github.com/Ton-Dynasty/tondynasty-contracts/tree/main/contracts/packages/token/nft  And here is a simple example  https://github.com/Ton-Dynasty/tondynasty-contracts/blob/main/contracts/nft_example.tact (reply to 7676)

Vlad: you know the addresses of wallets A nad B, you receive messages from them (reply to 7684)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: really weird (reply to 7683)

Vincent: receive messages from #DEBUG#: ctx.sender     #DEBUG#: 106049046352529569845024950561425216312340780032640300146531616007534400268795 #DEBUG#: TokenTransferInternal myAddress()     #DEBUG#: 106049046352529569845024950561425216312340780032640300146531616007534400268795

Vlad: you do not interact with jetton master

Vlad: only with wallets

Vlad: notification comes from them

Vincent: But in that case, how do I know if the address belongs to tokenA or tokenB? (reply to 7698)

Nikita: if we interact only with wallets (and they are separate smart contracts).  Then what is stopping the wallet to send the amount which is bigger than his balance? AFAIU there is no balances map in master contract so can't validate that the user has those money ü§î

Heydar: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md#summary (reply to 7686)

Vincent: Read it many times, didn't find any help for my question, or was our question wrong? What I don't know is whether my question is in the wrong direction, or whether I haven't found a solution? (reply to 7711)

Vincent: Could you clarify it for me? (reply to 7711)

Grit: I mean technically. Did you run them locally along with jetton contracts? Or is there some online sandbox? I'm new to TON so I'm sorry if this is a stupid  question (reply to 7707)

Vlad: yeah, looks like you don't understand how jettons work (bring jetton master for no reason) (reply to 7713)

Vlad: you can run locally using blueprint folder "tests" (reply to 7715)

Vincent: hi everyone, does anyone know the comparison method of A and B jetton in task3? Thank you

Vlad: Compare the sender with JettonAddresses

Kastu≈õ: 0/10 with all features working in my test script üòÇ (reply to 7720)

Vlad: Yeah (reply to 7720)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: There might be a slight discrepancy between your test and theirs. Based on my experience, it is more efficient to submit directly than to write a test, as you do not know how they structure their test. (reply to 7722)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: For instance, some messages require to be bounceable. (reply to 7660)

Vlad: Isn‚Äôt it by default? (reply to 7727)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Sure

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: But what is the problem when i set bounce:false?

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: If they do not implement a bounce receiver, then whether to 'bounce' or not does not matter.

Vlad: It changes the number of events and transactions (reply to 7731)

Vlad: I think they check it in tests

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Yeah

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I suppose as well.

Kon: bounce: true is by default (reply to 7665)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Another question: Will setting bounce: false reduce gas consumption? (reply to 7736)

Kon: I guess that yes, but only if the message doesn't need to be bounced in tests

Howard: If your contract has a balance of zero, then using SendRemainingValue will not leave any amount of TONcoin in it.  (Similar to the scenario when using self.forward)  If there is a balance in the contract and you want to clear it, then using SendRemainingBalance will bring the contract's balance to zero, even if this withdrawal transaction involves only a small amount of TONcoin. (reply to 7824)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: you need to "reserve" this N (reply to 7824)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I agree with your perspective. Unit testing is indeed a powerful method for identifying bugs and optimizing gas usage, but it truly shines when we have a thorough understanding of every checkpoint and detail in our specification. Therefore, if we successfully pass all the test cases, local testing becomes crucial. It is important to consider that if we lack insight into how the server conducts the tests (how they implement their underlying contracts), writing tests may only help us identify issues that we are already aware of.

Kenny: when withdrawing all NFTs, each draw set to take an avg context value?

./FerNaN: If error arises should we store the NFT in the map? or just ignore it? (reply to 7851)

&rey: Just ignore it. By the way, contract may not even know about the error occuring, since it can happen at action phase (after all computations). (reply to 7853)

BrayanD: Thank you!, btw when the admin makes a withdrawal should we keep in the Smart Contract 1 ton and use the remaining 0.08 * totalNft tons to transfer each NFT? or split equally the total amount of tons for each trasfer? (reply to 7851)

&rey: Use a bit less (0.06 TON) per NFT, you'll need the remaining money for calculations. (reply to 7855)

BrayanD: But for the calculations we have the extra 1ton right? Because the admin sends 1 + 0.08*Nfts tons (reply to 7856)

&rey: I predict that you need more than 1 TON for calculations. (That's reason you can send no more than 100 NFTs, 255 would fail.) (reply to 7857)

Kenny: shipment value is forwardAmount? (reply to 7920)

Luis Daniel ,‚ìÇÔ∏è MEMES‚ñ™Ô∏èüêæ: If you simply use that method, they will charge you for gas from the value of the shipment itself. (reply to 7918)

Luis Daniel ,‚ìÇÔ∏è MEMES‚ñ™Ô∏èüêæ: As far as I know, that field is what is sent to the user of the shipping value. (reply to 7922)

Vlad: Why gas from balance? (reply to 7920)

Vlad: You will lose profit

Vlad: Should forwardAmount be 0?

Luis Daniel ,‚ìÇÔ∏è MEMES‚ñ™Ô∏èüêæ: When you receive a message, the tons it contains are deposited directly into the contract balance and when you use the mode: "SendPayGasSeparately"  What it does is pay the gas balance of the message that you are going to send from the balance of the contract (reply to 7925)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I came up a question: when will SendRemainingBalance evaluates its value? Suppose that myBalance is 200 ton at the beginning. When receiving an arbitrary message, I use a nativeReserve(ton("100"), 0) and then send a message with mode  SendRemainingBalance, how much ton will the contract send?

sd: Balance except 100 ton (reply to 7993)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: How about change it to nativeReserve(ton("100"), 0+4), and nativeReserve(ton("100"), 0+8)? (reply to 7994)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: disagree.  --- Docs: nativeReserve calls native raw_reserve function with specified amount and mode. The raw_reserve() is a function that creates an output action to reserve a specific amount of nanotoncoins from the remaining balance of the account. ---  your source balance 200  you recieve msg with X tons for gas, you balance is 200+X after recieve phase  execution of your code (compute phase) spend some gas Y, so you have balance 200+X-Y, and you created "output action" to reserve 100 and second output action to send msg with SendRemainingBalance.  in action phase, "reserve 100" executed and now you have "available" balance 200+X-Y-100, which will be sent with SendRemainingBalance (reply to 7994)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Wow! Thank you for your clarification! Will the output balance different if i change the mode to +4 / +8 ? I couldn't clearly understand the explanation on the document. (reply to 7996)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: --- +4 - Increase amount by the original balance of the current account (before the compute phase) --- so nativeReserve(100, 0+4) will reserve 200 (source) +100, so last msg will send 200+X-Y-(200+100) so it will fail if X is less than 100+Y (reply to 7997)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: about +8.. dont understand when "negate amount" may be used, sorry. its better to check FunC / TVM docs, but I don't have time now

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I really appreciate your elaboration. Thanks a lot!

Andy: let's say X is 200, Y is 75, and we send a message with SendRemainingValue. Would nativeReserve(100, 0) and nativeReserve(100, 4) be the same thing? Because incoming message's value is always used first, Y and nativeReserve(100, z) would also be spent/reserved from the incoming value. And so sending remaining value would result in 25 nanotoncoins being sent back regardless, right?  Also to add to the discussion, I'd guess that +8 flag would be for unreserving an amount of nanotoncoins (reply to 7998)

sd: please describe, i'm newbie (reply to 7996)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: sc recieved 1 + 200 + 1 in three messages something spent for gas (and storage) with last, you reserved 100 and send all other ("SendRemaniningBalance) yes, your balance is exactly 100 because you sent all other except reserved 100 (reply to 8002)

sd: so, the question was: > how much ton will the contract send? my answer was: > Balance except 100 ton  sc sent:  > all other except reserved 100  where i was wrong o_o (reply to 7994)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: sorry too complex to think now :) (reply to 8001)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: what is "balance" in your answer? original balance before msg or final balance  msg reciev + action phases ? (reply to 8004)

sd: final balance ofc ü´° i meant that on sc balance would be exactly 100 ton (reply to 8006)

sd: ü§î

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: with original question with "balance = 200 at the beginning" and your answer "balance except 100" I supposed that your answer is 200-100 = 100  but actually its 200+X-Y-100 so its not exactly 100 (reply to 8006)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Why is the ratio being 2/3?

Heydar: but how I know that time? (reply to 8229)

Heydar: üò¢üò¢üò¢ Ah god, my poor brain can't help me ...

Kilyandra: oops my bad (reply to 8230)

Kilyandra: yes you are right

Kilyandra: Slice is not a just "dictionary", you need to know how to parse slices correctly (reply to 8227)

Andrey: Guys, please any hints on 3rd one? Just playing the guessing game for a while..  What I have:   - top up from admin  - balance and price works  - echange works   - price throws if any jetton count is zero  - send jettons back in case not enough jettons to exchange  - throw if unknown jetton and send it back  - wrote tests that check exchange messages, balances and prices  9/10

testertesterov: Yes. I managed to do this after ~150 tests üëç (reply to 8237)

Mario: that's exactly my question (reply to 8236)

Andrey: you are the man (reply to 8238)

Mario: I receive a TokenNotification and need to parse a dictionary inside the forward_payload Slice

Kilyandra: are you sure that you need to do this?

Mario: yes

Kilyandra: why

testertesterov: getPrice{B->{return "A"} and {A-> return "B"}}? (reply to 8240)

Mario: I need to send an array of data via TokenNotification, so need to use map for that

Mario: it's not related to the contest btw

Kilyandra: oh (reply to 8247)

Kilyandra: do you know how this dictionary is stored? (reply to 8241)

Kilyandra: you need to know what structure of data this "dictionary" have and you will easy parse it on receiving

Mario: const keys = Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(256);         const route: Swap['route'] = Dictionary.empty(keys, null);         route.set(0n, { $$type: 'RouteEntry', lpAddress: lp.address, side: false, minOut: 0n });  Yes this is how I create it.  And here is Tact message/struct: message Swap {     routeLength: Int as uint8;     route: map<Int, RouteEntry>; }  struct RouteEntry {     lpAddress: Address;     side: Bool; // true = buy, false = sell     minOut: Int as coins; } (reply to 8249)

Heydar: As far as I know, this contest is just for debugging their tools and better Tact compiler tools. So when I think about how the developers should work on the bugs we cleared for them, I really want to cry. It's so hard for them, but I can understand them now. üòûüòûüò≠üò≠üò≠ I hope you (Ton and Tact developers) will be successful boys.

Andrey: unfortunately not: got 1 out 10 by swapping them (reply to 8245)

Kilyandra: why do you need map for this? (reply to 8251)

Andy: You shouldn't be throwing when there are no jettons. In a swap you should return the jettons, and in the price getter you should just return 0 (reply to 8237)

Mario: there's no array type in Tact and I implement an AMM with multiple swaps per tx (reply to 8254)

Kilyandra: so, when you are receiving Swap message, just using swap.route.get(0) doesn't work?

Mario: I don't have a "route". I only have a Slice aka forward_payload (reply to 8257)

Mario: I need to parse the route from the Slice

Kilyandra: show what are you sending in forward_payload

Mario: this message Swap {     routeLength: Int as uint8;     route: map<Int, RouteEntry>; }  struct RouteEntry {     lpAddress: Address;     side: Bool; // true = buy, false = sell     minOut: Int as coins; } (reply to 8260)

Mario: Swap encoded into Slice

Mario: anyway, gtg for a while. Thx for trying to help

Andrey: Thanks for suggestion, just left throw on wrong jetton type with no luck. Regarding returning jettons: should the same TokenTransfer message be used for that? (reply to 8255)

testertesterov: task4 3/5 Any ideas on what "try to test"?

Andy: yes make sure to fill out the fields according to the task's description (reply to 8264)

Railgun: I send transfer one by one, iterate through the whole nft map

Railgun: Using SendPayGasSeparately + SendIgnoreErrors

Railgun: And send with value 0.06 as suggested in this channel

Railgun: also i believe we need to check on ctx.value >= ton(1) + hold * ton(0.08)?

Grit: But, there is also a gas limit

Artem: k

Toheeb: Any one on this? (reply to 8315)

Artem: we have 1 more ton for that, no?

Artem: dont get it

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: You recieved msg with 1+X*0.08 attached; Used some for sending nft, some for code execution, some is left and was added to your balance; You send msg to yourself When you process this message, only amount that was attached to it is used by default. Not coins on your balance.  Send money to yourself with "next" msg (reply to 8350)

Artem: i use mode 64

Artem: not enough?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/accept#internal-message here are deep details. 64 should work, but also may try 128

Grit: It would be really interesting to see what tricks people used for gas optimization

Grit: Gas usage optimization in Tact is not obvious nor trivial task. It would be great to have this topic covered in official tact docs.

Spite: My solutions for Tact Challenge: https://github.com/aSpite/tact-challenge-contracts.  I added a README in which I described almost all the optimizations in order to make it convenient to read the code. There are also some points about inaccurate tests.   The most interesting hacks:  - Storing the address as uint256 since Tact uses tact_verify_address every time an address is received, which consumes a lot of gas.  - Using commit (c4 and c5 saving) and throw(0) to abruptly exit the function when you only need to send a message without changing storage.  - The correct order of data storage in the storage. It is important to understand how Tact works with storage. It depends on which value will be the first on the stack. With the correct sequence of values used and their location in the storage, a significant improvement in gas can be achieved. (forwarded from Spite)

Railgun: Reuse seed as time in task 4? That's super interesting üòé (reply to 8571)

pizza-777: addr.skipBits(11) What is the function do/return? And why 11 bits? What is this bits? (reply to 8571)

Spite: Address consists of 267 bits. We need only last 256 bits, because they are data bits. First 11 were constant in context of this contest

Railgun: And maybe in task5 we could store nft as Slice instead of Address, so that no additional conversion call is required?

Spite: There are no Slice for value type. Actually, we can store as uint256, but there was bug, which does not allow you to use Int as ...  That's why I used Address as value type  I fixed it and created PR (reply to 8583)

Railgun: Also in the context mentions: The smart contract randomly chooses some NFT from the available NFTs (including the newly incoming one) and gives it to the user in exchange for the brought NFT So there might be a case that client send one without anything stored in nft. In that case, return back the new one.

User<5332466353>: Imagine the withdrawal scenario in Lido. When users want to withdraw, they can't immediately withdraw stETH for ETH. Instead, they will get a withdrawal voucher NFT. This voucher NFT records the amount of ETH for this time's withdrawal.

User<5332466353>: yes (reply to 8629)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: And the problem is:   If you pass these amount of eth as init parameter, you need to save them in nftCollection to calculate nft item address in the future

Spite: 4 bits for storeCoins(0) (reply to 8691)

pizza-777: ok. And why used storeUint(33792, 17) not storeUint(0x10, 6) Why need such long length of binary number in this case? (reply to 8692)

Spite: 6 bits for flags, 11 bits for address which consists of 267 bits.  11 + 256 = 267 (reply to 8694)

‚Äî 2023-10-23 ‚Äî

Spite: Because storeCoins(ton('0.01')) stores 28 bits of data.  storeCoins stores VarUint16, which means that the first 4 bits indicate how many bytes are needed to store the number. In this case, the number 10000000 fits in 24 bits, which makes 3 bytes. The first 4 bits contain the number 3, and the next 24 bits (3) bytes are the number itself. It turns out 28 bits + zero bit for custom payload (reply to 8702)

Mikhail: how can i convert cell into struct?

Howard: into struct? What do you mean. (reply to 8846)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: There is no way to serialize a cell into a struct directly (as far as I know). Alternatively, you should load data from cell one by one and then assign to a struct.

Mikhail: i'm trying to store some data in contract, there will be just a few Ints.   Since Cell is the most universal type of data i want to store it as cell. But if i want to change just one field in this cell i need to load each INT from cell, change some of them and then reupload it back to cell.  I want to do the next things:  Intead of parsing cell i want to do something like: struct MyStruct {    a: Int;    b: Int; }  some_data: Cell;   fun save_initial_struct(data: MyStruct) {     self.some_data = data.toCell(); }  fun change_a_field(value: Int) {    let parsedStruct: MyStruct = Cell.ParseToStruct(self.some_data)// i know that there is no method like this, just showing what i mean    parsedStruct.a = value;    self.some_data = parsedStruct.toCell(); } (reply to 8847)

Mikhail: @howard_peng as i understand there is no way how can i do this, so is should parse it with cell.beginParse().loadUint()...... and then change it re-write it in cell?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: If you want to store some ints in contract storage - declare them as contract-level variables and TACT will parse/store them automatically (reply to 8852)

Mikhail: These one's are in child-contract, tbh it's nft's so it's logical to store them in metadata (individual_content) which is a cell in a nft standart. (reply to 8856)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Slice is for reading. If you need 3rd int32 - you need to read two first (no need to store them anywhere)  To change slice - you must create new cell and rewrite it all. Two unchanged int32 first (so you have to store them in variables while reading), then new 3rd, then unchanged 4th. Then endCell() and store it where needed. (reply to 8866)

Mikhail: i need to check it in contract code (reply to 9404)

Maxey: Why do you have to check that in contract code

Mikhail: cause i need to have contract with unique ID in it and, of course i need to check if i am not trying to make some changes in contract, that was not deployed previously in function that basically deploys it (reply to 9406)

tyulpan: Maybe you need a pool of created contracts then? *if I understood the problem correctly (reply to 9410)

Maxey: You use initOf to deploy a child contract, which means you have the code for the child contract, allowing for successful deployment. However, if you need to verify whether the child contract has been deployed previously, you could use a map <>.

Mikhail: there may be like 10000+ contracts i want to deploy, i am using child contracts deploy method to store big amount of data  The most show-case example is NFT standart, where each NFT item has it's own address. Then how can i know if NFTItem already been minted? (reply to 9411)

Mikhail: but then how can i shard it if i'll have really big amounts of data (ex. 90000+ NFT's) this will cost lots of gas to just check if contract was deployed (reply to 9412)

Maxey: or you can send a msg to child contract and child contract will send msg back to you and  tell you is deployed or not

Mikhail: if you send messages to any contract, you need to have initState of a contract, and if you'll send a message to a contract it will automatically deployed to a chain (reply to 9415)

Maxey: You only  have to  use child's address and you can send a msg to it. It won't deploy a contract if you you don't use init and data when you send a msg (reply to 9416)

Yash: https://github.com/yash0501/nft_contracts_tact/tree/main/contracts  We used these contract to deploy nft and made the above change in the init function

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: If your nft index is serial numbers, then you can simply to compare the current index with the incoming one, in order to check whether the child contract (nft item) is deployed.  Since nft item init state may only related to collection address and index (depends on your usecase), therefore you can calculate their address by initOf. (reply to 9416)

Mikhail: this wont work if you mint nft's not by serial number but in random order (reply to 9423)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Oh I see. in your case, the index is not a sequence of numbers

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: And now you want to check that nft item with random index is deployed or not

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Am I understanding correctly?

Mikhail: not really nft, any contract but yes

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: Oh, you mean you‚Äôre interacting with other contract, but you are not sure if the contract is deployed

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: As far as I know, there is no way to check an arbitrary address is deployed. An alternative is to send a bounceable message and receive the bounced message if the receiver contract  does not exist.

Mikhail: do you know any examples of this i can check? (reply to 9430)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: This answer is based on my experience, but I will search it with you. Wait for me to check several documents.

Maxey: I think this only way to do it too (reply to 9415)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: This section implies that a contract call expected to bounce back if the target contract does not exist.  https://docs.ton.org/develop/smart-contracts/guidelines/non-bouncable-messages

fabriregu: hello everyone, i have some questions about NFTs.  in Ton Blockchain there is one contract for the Collection and one contract for each Nfts. We need to pay each year a fee for storage.  The fee is only for the collection contract or for the nft contract too? how can i prevent that my collection/nft disappear because of i forget to pay the fee?

fabriregu: i'm working on this repo https://github.com/getgems-community-tact/nft-template-in-tact to study Nfts contract.  is there any youtube video that explain this contract? because the tests in this repo are checking only the minting of the Nft. I would like to know if there is a test suite that checks the transactions and balances of deployer, collectionContract, nftContract, user before and after Minting /Tranfer in order to better understand the money flow between all the actors.

sd: Task 5 from Tact Challenge (reply to 9703)

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: In tact challenge #5, i have tried nativeReserve to preserve exactly 2 Ton. However, it is equivalant to sending a message attached with 2 TON to ourselves, thus it is more expensive than just dwindle 2 ton from ctx.value (they have some tolerance of the test, so this way is feasible to pass the challenge). You may uncomment this line to check the gas usage.  https://github.com/alan890104/tact-challenge/blob/130628a8b2011401df3efba7d0058b576184786b/contracts/5.tact#L116

üÖ∞üÖªüÖ∞üÖΩ: I have just tested by a simple contract, which contains two receive functions with almost identical logic (target: to preserve about 1 TON in our contract), but the only difference is nativeReserve and deduct it from context directly.   In summary, native reserve costs 0.0127 gas unit, whereas deduct method costs  0.012215.   Thus, native reserve is a bit more expensive but more accurate. (native reserve exactly remain 1 TON in contract, but meanwhile dedeuct method will remain about 0.991 in the contract)  https://github.com/alan890104/tact-nativereserve-gas

You craft your entry contract such that it will receive some parameters and initiate another contract for one nft(this means sharding in smart contract design pattern). Discuss here. https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons  As any sub contract is also a contract and has a unique address , you craft your main contract such that it sends an external message, in this case initial hash or new address .Then your layer 3 app listens for any updates and has arbitrary business logic for any purpose. So two entities are in your hand without needing to touch Blockchain, doing everything you need without any gas . For future reference also you can utilize them . I assume some fundamental concepts of how TVM and Smart contract work are already available in  mind .For clearance I am open discussing more.Maybe I am wrong.

Mehdi: I respectfully disagree with your viewpoint. My proposed solution leverages an extensive array of entities, addresses, or smart contracts with minimal storage fees. The subcontract in question requires only a small balance for occupation (storage fee), remaining in standby until activated as needed (following the actor model). This design ensures code capability, providing advantages such as extensibility, configurability, and upgradability. The solution is designed for ease of maintenance and facilitates straightforward owner changes for future needs, which are crucial for our specific use case.  I am intrigued by the concept of indexing you mentioned and would appreciate further clarification. I am concerned about the potential overcomplication of our code and whether time-based indexing is necessary, given the inherent collision resistance of these entities. (reply to 10141)

Howard: through the ton sdk, we can get the Jetton WalletCode in Cell.   Is this Cell can turn into StateInit as we deal with in Tact?

Howard: This might be the missing feature for us in Tact:  We can't place 'contract initialization code and data' in 'StateInit' from off-chain and then store it at the on-chain level.  The scenario for this is as follows: Let's say I want to write a contract that is only callable by any 'jUSDT jetton wallet.' Then, I would need this method to mandatorily ensure that only the qualified addresses can send the message through.

Anthony: TON20 Inscription Use-case on TON Starting on December 5th, The Open Network (TON) experienced an incredible spike in network activity, thanks to the BRC20 Bitcoin Ordinals type of inscription use-case, called TON20, launched by the Tonano team.   Producing over 2 million transactions increased our network usage by 61 times within just half an hour. TON Community is proud to witness a creative use case take-off in TON driven by independent participants in the ecosystem.  Moreover, this sudden growth has revealed many interesting insights for our blockchain. Dynamic sharding technology worked as expected. At its peak, TON split into eleven shardchains, stabilizing at five shardchains to handle the heavy load.  At the same time, this phenomenon also revealed where the community should work to swiftly onboard the exponential increase in network activity expected in the near future. Network validators must ensure that TON is supported by hardware capable of scaling to the performance demanded by high usage.  Network Performance Delays This peak interest also came with a severe congestion of TON network, where validation was severely delayed even though the network validators are still producing blocks.   Popular wallets like @Wallet and Tonkeeper have paused the service temporarily.  TON core developers are aware of the issues affecting users and are working on TON blockchain. An initial technical report is available here. TON core team will be providing us with a further update within the next 24 hours.   We thank you and the community for your patience and unwavering support as we go through the growing pains together, preparing for the unprecedented growth season expected in the near future.

I want to continue my questions about map type.  ok, let's say we changed our mind about storing strings)  1. and i decided to store 1000 'bool' type in a map<Int as uint8, Int as uint256> of 4 elements (250 'bool-bits' in each uint256). how much will it cost the contract per year? Based on the calculations here: about 0.00072 TON + a little over 4 uint8?  2. or let's say i decided to store another - map<Int as uint16, Int as uint256> of 1000 elements and also in the contract. Then it will cost : approximately 0.184 + 0.012 TON per year.  Is that right? or how is the map stored in the contract, will it be more expensive? (reply to 11663)

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: You need 1 bit to store bool itself. Int256 can store 256 bools. You will need only four int256 if you learn about bit operations and bit shifts :)

Aleks: yes, that's what I'm talking about) my question is about the cost of storage. tell me pls, am I doing the calculation for the map correctly for storing 4 uint256. or will it be more expensive? since, 256 * 4 + 4 the key will be more than 1023 bits and 1+ cells is obtained.. and it will be more expensive? (reply to 11701)

Aleks: I took 250 bits out of 256 for the convenience of counting

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: using 4 int256 (into one cell) does NOT need using any map. if you want to use map - it will take more space (and cells) of course. You may try to store them in testnet and check storage length in explorers, or check dic serialization algorithm to understand how complex it is.

Aleks: Thanks, I will test it. But if need to scale much more than 4 elements, and store, for example, 1000+ mutable uint256 for the contract to interact with them, then can't get away from map..in Tact (reply to 11704)

Is it on master chain ? At the end we should have a database mechanism to find those instruction and bring them in scope. Anybody can help?  Why this question is important,  because in smart contract that have huge usecase , like wallet by using this technique we can reduce storage fee significantly,  like v5 of tonkeeper, in their repo , they said we used shared library,  in master chain . But I don't know how they did that , and which process should be carried out to have this facilities.  Database concepts in TON ,  and how they really works is hard to grasp .

Sorry.

Alex: This template? (reply to 12057)

Alex: am I going in the right direction?

Alex: or is it?

Alex: I've been trying to get help from the community to turn the contract around for 4 days now! I admit, I have no experience in creating smart contracts and may be asking primitive and possibly stupid questions.  But logically it's simple, there is a contract on tact (it works )   We need to deploy it  1. to do this you need to deploy an environment (blueprint, ton emulator or nudjan.io 2. to deploy it you need to edit several files, because the most complicated part is the contract itself (50% of the code is already there). 3. Deploy to testnet then to mainnet  What I have already done: I deployed an empty blueprint (npx blueprint test npx blue print run worked) here is the created contract https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQCsmbdWOCYeTkTnZb0yizoRr9k_p6Bi2qJjCp2wwFw4MgOp  Here is the main contract - https://github.com/wety-dev/jackpot-ton/blob/main/jackpot-ton.tact  What do I need to add?  paste the jackpot-ton.tact code into contracts/toncoin.tact I assume that I need to make changes to the files build/toncoin/tact_Toncoin.ts and scripts/deployToncoin.ts.  But I don't know what code should be added or edited?

Alex: I bluntly admitted that I have no knowledge.   I'm moving away from the task of deploying a smart contract and making it work.   The contract is already in place (it works and it's open).  I'm just asking you to save me time and help me deploy it for myself.   I think it won't take a good specialist long.   I will deploy the code and learn TACT gradually. (reply to 12077)

Alex: I'm not asking you to write me a contract. I'm just asking you to help me run the contract...

Alex: I just asked for help, this is clearly a 15-minute job for a good technician.   it's not like I asked to create a contract, just help get it up and running  The contract has already been created and it's open.

Bear: do we have the multi-Signing example before?

Bear: Contract method needs to be set up with a multi-signature system, similar to the TON bridge.   For instance, if there are three validators, the function call operation by the user would only be executed by the smart contract after 2 out of 3 validators have confirmed it.

Mikhail: Hello everyone, we're currently developing a project on ton and currently on testing phase so we're facing problem with high prices for transactions. We have like 5 contracts, which communicating with each other, and some simple transaction with NFT transfer+ store a few bits on-chain costs almost 0.5 TON.   Since we are building gasless system for our users, it makes very difficult to always have balance on dev accounts (and it's also costs lotts of money).  So we're currently looking for an option to "batch" our transactions, is there a way?

Yuri: Hello guys, I'm importing a common contract into two different others, since I need addresses calculated given the InitData. Though, I'm not getting the same address for both given the same InitData. I investigated a little bit and found out that the generated FunC code for the same imported contract was different for each context in just one place, the IPFS link for the ABI. Since the IPFS CID should be the same if the files are equal, I've taking a look at the generated ABI for each case and noticed that there're exit codes that doesn't belong to the common contract, the one I want the address to be calculated, but from the contracts that it's being imported into.

Aydin: Just as a raw idea to think of:  What about creating a 3rd contract C which then imports both A and B simultaneously?  Rationale. According to your description about cyclic imports, it seems that contracts A and B should look as peers of each other, with equal ranks in some hierarchy of contracts. So, a third contract C which to be of a higher hierarchy may handle both of them equally. (reply to 15495)

Spite: Not necessarily a contract, you can just create a file that imports two contracts, but still cyclic imports should be handled correctly, because creating 3 files for such a case is not a direct solution (reply to 15545)

Yuri: Hello guys, I got another problem, since I'm importing 2 NFTs which I need the code to calculate it's addresses and validate on a protocol contract. There're some structs that are common to both (NftData for example). It's not compiling because it says the struct already exists. How can I tackle this problem?

Andrew: move the common struct and message in a new file.tact, and import this file as need. (reply to 15673)

Yuri: But it'll be needed in both NFTs and I also need to import both NFT codes, is that fine? (reply to 15681)

Andrew: import N times in other N files

Yuri: It worked thanks! (reply to 15683)

Daniil: I guess implementing imports the way they work in TS would be nice, but we'll also need to maintain backward compatibility and make  import "./file";  identical to  import * from "./file";

Macrov: Thank you, Andrew, but I didn't find a very direct answer. In the post-compilation report file, there is a line stating "BOC Size: 20167 bytes." Is there a specific size limit for this BOC size? Currently, my code's BOC size can reach up to approximately 20197 bytes. Is this size a fixed limit for each contract, or does it relate to the types of variables declared and the number of functions in the code? (reply to 15822)

Andrew: I also didn't find a very direct answer (reply to 15831)

Aydin: As I understand, TON contracts are supposed to be as compact as possible. Let me give a comparison.  In Ethereum, contracts have a "monolith" structure; that is, a single (possibly huge) contract can store a list of a myriad of items (tokens, NFTs, etc.) in itself. And when a new item is to be added to the list, a new transaction occurs, extending the size of the contract.  On the other hand, in TON the situation is completely different. TON blockchain works with the "actor model," and this is one the cornerstones of its infinite scalability. In this model, instead of a single giant contract, we have a composite structure of relatively small-sized contracts, consisting of a "parent" contract together with lots of "child" contracts, each of which storing a single item of the list as compared to the above monolithic Ethereum contract. And whenever a new item is to be added to the list, a message is sent to the parent contract which, in turn, generates a new child contract containing the newly added item. This way, infinite extendibility of the list of items is guaranteed in TON ecosystem.  Now, returning to your question, I would kindly recommend you to keep your contracts as compact as possible, and instead try to utilize the actor model of TON. I'm sure you will achieve better results this way. (reply to 15831)

Alireza: I've mentioned the reason behind 130 exit code. I'm not talking about query_id. about 0xffff, yeah it's something that developer writes in FunC manually but, in Tact, it is done automatically and instead of throwing 0xffff, it throws 130 (reply to 15921)

CryptoMM Cool: Same question.. (reply to 16111)

Javier: I guess if the transaction is made to a contract, and that contract send multiple messages it is doable.like I send 10ton to a contract and in the internal message op I use a function that send multiple messages to multiple parties. (reply to 16111)

Truong: Tks

Jay: Do you have any code samples on this? (reply to 16122)

Mirka: How much more gas does the tact use than the func?

Javier: It should be the same. Tact compiles to func and then it compiles like func

Mirka: I know that, but I was told in @tondev chat that tact uses more. I mean, that's what I thought, but I need more about the difference (reply to 16137)

Javier: I dont think so, of course since tact is a simpler language, I guess people will make simpler things and store more stuff than needed. But it really depends on what kind of processing the language do in  the end. If a function from tact that compiles in func do 10 operations, and you can do the same with 4 operations in func, probably it will cost more. That would be the normal if you use a higher level language. Is like comparing C# against c++ or assembler. The lower the level of the language, the more optimized it is.

Andrei: Hello guys I hope this type of message is allowed  I am looking for a dev who can write 3 smart contracts. Pls pm me - we can discuss it in more details

‚Äî 2024-03-16 ‚Äî

Howard: At this moment, Jetton Transfers may incur twice the gas cost in Tact.  However, there is certainly room for improvement. The higher-level language has more structured patterns, which should allow for optimization at the compiler level.  Although, as of now, Tact is more of a transpiler that helps you generate FunC code after you compile your Tact-lang code. (reply to 16136)

Jay: Agree on this. I feel the same when I first comes to FunC/Fift. It's a steep learning curve for me. After I discovered Tact, I get the job done with fewer line of codes and cleaner overall structure. Personally, I think it worth the tradeoff. üòÑ (reply to 16139)

Mirka: Can you please explain how to decompile tact to func.  Is it to possible using blueprint? (reply to 16221)

Howard: decompile? after running the yarn build successfully, then you will get func code in your build folder. (reply to 16246)

Mirka: Oh, Im stupid, thank you (reply to 16249)

Mirka:     owner: Address;     jetton_master: Address;     jetton_wallet: Address?;      init(owner: Address, jetton_master: Address) {         self.owner = owner;         self.jetton_master = jetton_master;          send(SendParameters{             to: self.jetton_master,             value: 0,             mode: SendRemainingValue,             body: ProvideWalletAddress{query_id: now(), owner_address: myAddress(), include_address: true}.toCell()         });     }      receive(msg: TakeWalletAddress) {         let ctx: Context = context();         require(ctx.sender == self.jetton_master, "Invalid sender");         self.jetton_wallet = msg.wallet_address;     }  This code should just get jetton wallet address, but tx always get exit code 9. I know, that its cell underflow, but I dont understand where do I read empty cell.  Here are my messages:  message(0x2c76b973) ProvideWalletAddress {     query_id: Int as uint64;     owner_address: Address;     include_address: Bool; } message(0xd1735400) TakeWalletAddress {     query_id: Int as uint64;     wallet_address: Address;     owner_address: Address?; }

Javier: Arr you sending money for gas fee?

Mirka: Yes, 0.5 ton should be enough (reply to 16261)

Javier: I am seeing in your code value 0, thats why I am asking

Mirka: It has SendRemainingValue mode, but I'll try to set it (reply to 16263)

Sergey: how can I calculate the cost of storing a variable? For example, int ?

Javier: SendRrmainingValue is that it will returning back the money you are sending, but as the value is 0, nothing can be returned. Just saying, not that I really checked your code :)

Javier: There is a formula for the cost of bits. The int depending on the size 8 bits 32 bits 64 bits. That will be the amount of bits (reply to 16265)

Sergey: where can I check  formula? (reply to 16267)

Mirka: Nope( (reply to 16266)

Javier: This is, but the real cost, I don't know. I guess you can try storing a 8bit int, in testnet, then wait for 1 week, you will know about the amount

Javier: I read in the course it should be like 0.5ton or something like that for a year of 1MB. If I remember well 1MB is about 1 million it's of 8bit

Mirka: Maybe @dev_rel(sorry fot tagging I just really need this) know, I saw your github with jettons implementations on tact

Howard: int? is not same as int (reply to 16313)

Howard: I don't think here should be the Address? (reply to 16258)

Mirka: Yes, but without ? it was null and I got exit code 9 (reply to 16315)

Jay: Exit code 9 cell underflow, do you pass in storeAddress when calling to the contract? (reply to 16317)

Slava: Hey guys! A few questions.  Is Tact can be considered production-ready right now?  Do we have some serious projects implemented in Tact?  Does it produce optimized code for most cases?  Or are we still safer using FunC for now?

Slava: BTW you did an extraordinary work. Tact looks amazing and very dev-friendly, based on what I've read at the documentation. I'm sure it will attract a lot of new developers to the TON in the future and will dramatically reduce the adoption curve.

Anton: Let me put it this way: I‚Äôd say Tact is prototype-ready at this moment. It‚Äôs a great solution to create your MVP and encode the core of your business-logic in Tact, interfacing with some manually optimized FunC code when there is gas pressure. There is at least one serious project that utilizes this approach. The output FunC code that Tact produces can be suboptimal in many cases but this is to be expected since Tact is a more high-level language. The Tact team will be working on gas optimizations, though, as soon as we finish the features outlined in the Tact roadmap. You can checkout how these features and bugfixes are spread across different milestones here: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/milestones. Our main priority are UX improvements and compiler correctness now. We are going to have Tact‚Äôs implementation checked by a top-notch software security audit firm and also we are building our own security-ensuring tools, like a compiler fuzzer: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/133. (reply to 16328)

Anton: Thanks so much for your words. Btw, the recent Tact features were contributed by @Gusarich and the major update to the Tact documentation was done by @novusnota42. Both guys are on the Tact team now, continuing to enhance and improve the language, the docs and the tooling around it (reply to 16330)

Mirka: What do you mean? (reply to 16322)

Jay: How do you call the contract? I think there's something missing when passing in, then contract trying to extract the value, thus causing the exit code 9 hmm. (reply to 16333)

Mirka: Yes, but I dont understand what's the reason Can you try to run my code? I can share it (reply to 16334)

Raden0x: Tact by far is way better than FunC if you‚Äôre familiar with JS and TS it will flow right in (reply to 16330)

Slava: I don't think that "better" is the correct word here :)  The choice between these two languages shouldn't be done lightly right now. It's more complicated. (reply to 16960)

Raden0x: true maybe better is a too much of a stronger term, but the option to have something similar  to what i was used to helps

Raden0x: Hey guys! Deployed my first to collections with each having an nft item within each collection.   I do have a question though‚Ä¶ I noticed my metadata thats uploaded to the ipfs isn‚Äôt being uploaded correctly to the blockchain or get gems. I run it first and get a link out of it but when I inject it into the metadata link into one of the params of my deployment, it‚Äôs not uploading correctly.

Raden0x: const metadata_link = 'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmc3ZuVvdeKQTStaoHNhAp9cW84AWnHsJhRRnzG2V2HCQP'; // will need to add this IPFS url      let content: Cell = beginCell().storeInt(OFFCHAIN_CONTENT_PREFIX, 8).storeStringRefTail(metadata_link).endCell();     let owner = provider.sender().address!;      const nftCollection = provider.open(await OysterNftCollection.fromInit(owner, content, {         $$type: "RoyaltyParams",         numerator: 50n, // 50n = 5%         denominator: 1000n,         destination: owner,     }));

Raden0x: yep formatted as well.. (reply to 17875)

Jay: Let's check if your get_nft_data is getting 0.json correctly? Inside the deploy script have the base URL, then it'll append to the end of the base URL.

Raden0x: you mean this?? (reply to 17877)

&rey: Please answer: is calling get-methods of other contracts possible on TON? (reply to 17717)

Jay: Yes, then it'll be something like after your IPFS URL + "/collection.json" for your collection metadata, then after your IPFS URL + "/0.json", "/1.json", "2.json"... for the rest of NFT item metadata (reply to 17878)

Raden0x: something like this (reply to 17885)

Raden0x: i must be missing something here?

Jay: Can you try accessing your ${metadata_link}/collection.json in any browser to see if it's loading? (reply to 17878)

Daniil: At this time, you'll have to define and import FunC functions in your Tact contract in order to work with exotic cells (reply to 18091)

mooncake: if i build a merkle tree in my contract, can I dynamic add/delete entry in the tree?

Mikhail: yep, but there are limitation in TON on maps, Discussed it there for like 100 times (reply to 18113)

Daniil: they're talking about merkle trees. (reply to 18114)

Daniil: yes, there are Merkle Update cells. (reply to 18113)

Xander: if I want to create a contract that using a func file as my trait, how could I do?

Mikhail: and? They are still will be stored in a map i guess? (reply to 18115)

Daniil: you can check out my Scalable Airdrop project on github: https://github.com/Gusarich/airdrop  it utilizes merkle trees. without merkle updates but if you understand and implement the rest of it in your project, adding merkle updates won't be hard. (reply to 18091)

Daniil: smart contract will only store the root hash of the map, while the map itself is stored somewhere offchain (reply to 18118)

mooncake: what limitation about maps?  can not find any information about it on docs.   do you means the max length of map? how much is this? (reply to 18114)

Daniil: yes, contract can only store around ~30k map items at the moment, but it might possibly be expanded in future. (reply to 18122)

mooncake: great! I will try.  thanks for your repo (reply to 18119)

Xander: for example, I want to use https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-minter-discoverable.fc as a trait to create my own jetton contract, how could I do it?

Anton: Chat history search does wonders: https://t.me/tactlang/1980 :) (reply to 18191)

Denis: Thank you guys! I hope it works as intended, not leaving the key value in storage or something.

Daniil: it actually deletes the value. syntax is not very dev-friendly at the moment, but .del() function will be added to Tact in one of future releases (reply to 18194)

Denis: It's thousand times friendlier than the Func syntax anyway =) (reply to 18196)

Denis: Thanks for clarification!

Xander: How can I set addr_none (aka store_uint(0, 2)) in tact lang?

Javier: I read the maximum size of global variables is 31. This is for func contracts. But you should not have such that lot of variables, try to split in multiple contracts as it will be easier to mantain

Sumit: why cant i send messages

Mayushii: try it after bankai (reply to 18232)

Sumit: damn

Sumit: error: previous function return type ((int, int, int, int, int, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, int), int) cannot be unified with implicit end-of-block return type (): cannot unify type () with ((int, int, int, int, int, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, cell, int), int)  can anyone help me with this error?

Javier: You have in your return some variable that is different than your function returning definition. As I see in the error you have a return type that start with 5 int's and you are returning from the function, only 4 int's (from the beginning

Sumit: i have rechecked my return type and can confirm they are okay (reply to 18241)

Javier: Why are you returning a () inside? Like ((...),int)

Sumit: fuck i found it (reply to 18244)

Sumit: was returning nothing where a bool was expected

Javier: hmmhu this happened to me, not with tact, but on func

Sumit: the error can be better reported ig

EriküÜì: No, other contracts are not available during execution. (reply to 18271)

Pike ü¶¥ üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è: That means cross contract interaction is not yet available on TON? (reply to 18272)

EriküÜì: Contracts send messages to other contracts. (reply to 18273)

Pike ü¶¥ üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è: Ah, so sending messages is still OK but getting their states is not huh

EriküÜì: Yes, since getting information directly from other contracts during execution assumes that all contracts are available on the same node and that would not be scalable. (reply to 18275)

Raden0x: @jiayee9729 hey how are you? mayeb this can give us some insight. Upon looking at the testnet.explorer.tonnft.tools i got a better insight on how its uploading to the blockchain. You can see that the "Content" isn't including the proper end point and its just "0" not "0.jpg" or 0.json... however for the collection it does upload correctly

Raden0x: @jiayee9729

Raden0x: @jiayee9729 here's the collection

Jay: Heyy @NewCodeOnDaBlock , can you check this equivalent function in your codes?

Jay: This would be the part of it appending item_index and .json to the NFT item ya

Raden0x: yes thats correct @jiayee9729

Jay: Does it includes the ".json" part?

Raden0x: but this test im showing above was me seeing if a .json file woould make a difference.. its always been blappend(".json")

Raden0x: should i include something there? (reply to 18364)

Jay: Yepp the individual_content should be passed in as the base url, then the codes should be handling the appending json logic for you ya

Raden0x: so maybe removing b.append(".json")? (reply to 18371)

Jay: Yepp let's try that

Raden0x: okay lets see

Jay: Cool

Raden0x: worked!!!!!! (reply to 18377)

Jay: Great to hear that! ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°

Raden0x: btw.. so if i wanted to deploy another nft item into that collection.. I wouldn't be able to and would need to deploy a brand new collection contract with the list of nft items id want to deploy correct? @jiayee9729

Jay: Yes need deploy brand new collection contract with new list of nft items

„Éû„É†„É´: Guys, I have a newbie question. 1. Wrote a simple smart contract with Tact.  2. Ran a command npx blueprint run 3. Chose Tonkeeper option, but forgot to change to testnet. And scanned QR with main net wallet instead. 4. As a result contract was not deployed, and I‚Äôve got an error (that contract was not deployed) 5. Now when I try to rerun the command npx blueprint run I‚Äôm getting: ‚ÄúUser has already opened the previous request ‚Äú How do I fix it?ü§î

Dmitry: Hello guys! Does anyone knows how to read value from bounced<T> message?   Now tact compiler fails with error Type bounced<"InternalInitWalletSettings"> does not have a field named "owner"

Daniil: Bounced messages are very limited by size (reply to 18681)

Dmitry: I read it in the documentation, but maybe there is some kind of solution? (reply to 18682)

Dmitry: I have to return back coins, when my message bounced, but i can't read address of first transaction initator.

Daniil: in that case you should consider sending a message that will act like a "bounce" (reply to 18684)

Dmitry: Can you show example? (reply to 18685)

kh: Who wants to sell notcoin's vaucher

Daniil: just send a message back to the sender instead of throwing an error  but note that in some cases you'll also need to validate that the message came from a correct smart contract (reply to 18686)

Dmitry: My message workflow: Initator -> MasterWallet -> ChildWallet (bounce)  BouncedMessage (from ChildWallet) -> MasterWallet (here i can't define initator address) -> Return coins back (reply to 18688)

Daniil: and it could be:  Initator -> MasterWallet -> ChildWallet (MyBounceMessage) MyBounceMessage (from ChildWallet) -> MasterWallet (here you can get all data) -> Return coins back (reply to 18689)

Jimmy Becen: Hi guys, Today I can't find the Jetton Token Launchpad example anymore :(. Can someone who cloned it please send it to me?

Facu: Hello! I am needing a little help with a very basic question. I've deployed for the first time an smart contract, as a simple test I was using 03-send-coins sample from TACT site and added only 1 more receive with other parameters. But when deployed in production I've sent 0.05 TON with Tonhub wallet and I got back 0.041841 TON. Then I've sent to the contract again 0.05 but got back 0.046926 TON. Does it means that there is an error when processing the messages?

Facu: I am sending funds to the contract with empty message. So I asume should do nothing and only receive the funds as defined in this part of the contract:      // accept incoming TON transfers     receive() {         dump("funds received");     }

Sumit: how can i integrate ton wallet with the wrapper that is generated using blueprint?

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: Do not decide about transaction status by returned amount. Use explorer (tonscan.org, tonviewer.com, ...) and check your wallet there. (reply to 19055)

Facu: thanks for answering, I am looking into it, but I dont understand why all money sent is returned, ... maybe is a simple thing but I am just starting working with TACT

Facu: Oh, I can not post the image ...

Facu: What I see is Exit code: 130, and the text bounce

Dmitry | backend4you.ton: so, look for throw (130) in your code (reply to 19074)

Facu: I dont have something throwing that, it is a simple example from TACT site. And local test works. "130 Tact (Compiler) Invalid incoming message ‚Äî no suitable operation is found" Probably is a simple thing but I new on this ...

Facu: I was assuming that this part would accept any message, mmm      // accept incoming TON transfers     receive() {         dump("funds received");     }

Anton: exit codes are documented here: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/exit-codes (reply to 19074)

Daniil: and where is the error? (reply to 19089)

Facu: I don't see any error when deploying, but I got this money returned

Facu: I will now send a message to the contract ...

Facu: oh! now the coins are received without issues

Facu: the only thing that I dont understand is why on the deploy the money was returned, but it's not an issue for me

Daniil: That‚Äôs how it works (reply to 19094)

Daniil: It sends a ‚Äúnotification‚Äù about successful deployment

Good: Hello. Is it possible to implement such a trick so that the transaction is executed only when the recipient confirms it? In other words, the transaction is executed only if there are two signatures

Good: /report (reply to 19294)

Blockchain Dev: I dont understand this contract was deployed or not? How could I realize that?

Blockchain Dev: certificate = blockchain.openContract(await Certificate.fromAddress(certAddress)); retrieves to me correct address

Blockchain Dev: I've caught the event! And now I can see that it definitely being deployed to different address. But why?

Alexander: Hey guys. I have a method that accepts private key and returns public key based on input:   get fun get_public_key_from_private_key(private_key: String): String {     // need to do smth to get public key     let public_key: String = private_key;      return public_key; }   But I haven't found any library for tact to do so. Is there any simple way to implement it?

Daniil: why would you need that? (reply to 19335)

Alexander: quite hard to explain a project that works like a pow miner of addresses, I need to verify that user owns an address without direct tx/request from the address (reply to 19336)

Alexander: I looked through the funC documentation and didn't find the method I was looking for in it as well. Hope it is possible without making a lot of crypto things

Daniil: sending private key to smart contract is not safe anyway (reply to 19338)

Blockchain Dev: Btw, I can see that your MintItem has only 2 fields, but you send MintItem with 3 fields in body in message (reply to 17224)

Blockchain Dev: Well I've done it. I put params into Init of child contract separately instead a structure. Put fixed value. And made a function call that creates child without parameters, left a literal only (reply to 19384)

Blockchain Dev: That is parent contract

Blockchain Dev: That is child

Blockchain Dev: And that is how I create child. It works

Blockchain Dev: BTW, somebody know could we get parent contract's address with TON itself? Something like address.parent

Blockchain Dev: I've got a new bug. I'm testing child creation with for() statement and every 3 or 4 call doesn't set owner address to child contract. I checked events and realized that when I'm doing call to the parent's function that makes a couple of calls to a child contract second call doesn't happen every 3 or 4 times. It looks like it is a bug of TON emulator

Blockchain Dev: Well, probably TON doesn't able to work with more than a single call with a single transaction. I've split calls to separate functions and it became a solution

Ken: it can definitely send multiple messages in a single tx (reply to 19403)

Blockchain Dev: What is your opinion why it loose second call if both calls are present in a single function? (reply to 19406)

Blockchain Dev: Func is the thing I won't see ever

Miras: There are optional types in tact (reply to 19412)

Good: Incorrect question has incorrect answer. Tact is a wrapper over FunC.  If you want to store null values, you can use optional values (reply to 19412)

Alexander: I asked how to do so without structs (reply to 19419)

&rey: .storeUint(0, 1) into Builder. (reply to 19412)

Anton: Is Tact zero-cost abstraction on top on FunC? (reply to 19419)

Doge: 11

Anton: It‚Äôs not an abstraction on top of FunC. It‚Äôs a language currently implemented using compilation (some would also say transpilation) into FunC (reply to 19427)

Anton: It has some costs to it, though. And it does not have to be like this in the future. You just write a compiler backend and you don‚Äôt have to deal with FunC (except when interacting with FunC contracts)

Yari: Could you explain is there any function or property of TACT that could retrieve a parent contract? (reply to 19438)

Good: you should just know its address in any case (reply to 19449)

Javier: And save it in the childcontract (reply to 19450)

Good: or use parent pattern (reply to 19449)

Yari: I ask about some solution that can prove that address 1 is derived from address 2

Yari: To prove that some nft belongs exactly to some collection

Javier: Just the same you can do to know the owner, saving the owner address, you can save the collection address

Yari: That is not solution. I can deploy my own nft that will contain address of your collection (reply to 19456)

Javier: In your collection you have an index, the address of the nft will be generated based on the index and the collection address if I am not mistaken

Javier: The initstate that will create the address of the nft. It should be the index on your collection+the collection address+ the code

Yari: All this is public data, I can stole those to fake your NFT (reply to 19459)

Yari: Imagine you have an NFT collection. I deploy my own NFT, insert the address of your collection into it, and forge it so that my NFT looks similar to an NFT from your collection. Then, I sell it as if it were one of your NFTs.

Yari: Am I wrong?

Yari: Yeah, I forgot that, we can put autorization into code

Yari: And this code will prevent the forgery of the NFT.

Yari: I thought new address depends on Init params only, I forgot that it depends on code of the contract too

Denis: Hello everyone! When I try to calculate the address of some contract via usual Tact method (let init: StateInit = initOf SecondContract(arg1, arg2);let address: Address = contractAddress(init)), I get different address on 2 different contracts. Anyone has an idea on why it can happen?

Denis: I probably located the problem in compiled files, get_abi_ipfs has different values associated with it. Since it's a part of "OTP-003: Self-ABI reporting" and I don't need it, maybe I can turn it off somehow? Or any other way to fix this? (reply to 19783)

Denis: It seems that for some reason, structs from Parent contract get into child's ABI...

Vitor: I started trying to convert my notes while I was learning Tact into a primer... I did very rough first draft https://vitorpy.com/2024-04-08-tact-primer-for-solidity-devs/ if someone has some free time, I'd love to get some feedback and see how can I make it better

Johnny Le: Does TON token have smart contract

Dmitry: Yes. But it‚Äôs the network, not the token (reply to 20009)

Johnny Le: so no contract for native token ? (reply to 20013)

Dmitry: The native token itself is a smart contract (reply to 20014)

Boris: Can anyone tell the difference between loadUint and preloadUint?

Boris: if (msg.custom_payload != null) {     let payload: Cell = msg.custom_payload!!;     let nft_id: Int = payload.beginParse().loadUint(128);     self.nft_id = nft_id; }   Here loadUint produced this error:  //  error: lvalue expected before ~load_uint int $nft_id = begin_parse($payload)~load_uint(128);  With preloadUint it works fine..

Anton: loadUint moves the slice pointer after it reads data, but preloadUint does not do that (preload just does lookahead) (reply to 20205)

Boris: Hmm.. ok, why does the one throw an error and the other not? (reply to 20207)

Anton: because loadUint needs to mutate your slice which is a temp value in this case

Anton: if you store your slice (assign it to a variable) then you should be able to use loadUint

Boris: like   let slice: Slice = payload.beginParse() let int: Int = slice.loadUint(128)

Boris: Or do you mean assigning to the contract as a variable?

Nerses: Hello everyone! I'm delving into Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) and their implementation possibilities within blockchain frameworks. HTLCs are key for enabling secure, conditional, and time-bound transactions, making them essential for things like cross-chain trades and other trustless protocols. I'm particularly curious about implementations in the Tact language. Does anyone here have experience with HTLCs in Tact, or know of any resources or examples? Any guidance or examples you could provide would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!

Boris: Or somehow provide typing for a Kind of Cell?

Boris: lets say you have a   message MyMessage {   data: Cell; }   Its not clear what kind of data are inside the cell.

Boris: Ok, basically what I need in my contract is both the struct representation and the cell representation. I guess its then better to use struct for the interface part and create the cell on the fly where its needed.. ü§îÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

Vlad: Creating a mapping, setting value, but can't read it using get method     itemClaimed: map<Int, Bool>;    setting value,         self.itemClaimed.set(itemIndex, true);   but can't read it using this get method           get fun itemClaimed(index: Int): Bool{         return self.itemClaimed.get(index)!!;  }

Vlad: I am calling the get method like this in typescript   const claimed = await contract.getItemClaimed(0n);

Vlad: getting this error     Test suite failed to run      TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt         at stringify (<anonymous>)

&rey: Do you have false values also set in the map? !! operator does not provide default value but rather throws error if there is null. (reply to 20593)

Vlad: But I am trying to get the true value out of it

Vlad: if I put get method like this    get fun itemClaimed(index: Int): Bool?{         return self.itemClaimed.get(index);  }   I am getting  ``null`

Vlad: You mean there are no default values? (reply to 20596)

Anton: Nope (reply to 20599)

Vlad: hm, interesting:  if I set the value to "false" and then set to "true", all works fine  if I just set it to "true", I get null

Vlad: actually the interesting thing is that   I first set the value with key of type "Int as uint64" to false   if I set it with key of type "Int", I get null (reply to 20601)

Vlad: self.itemClaimed.set(self.itemCounter, false); // Int as uint64         self.itemClaimed.set(itemIndex, true); // Int   gives me true

Vlad: self.itemClaimed.set(itemIndex, false); // Int         self.itemClaimed.set(itemIndex, true); // Int    gives me null

Ken: How many bits does VarUInt16 take?

M-A‚Ñ¢: 15

Ken: So the definitions are: var_uint$_ {n:#} len:(#< n) value:(uint (len * 8))          = VarUInteger n; #< x - Nat less than x bit unsigned integer stored as lenBits(x - 1) bits, up to 31 bits According to my understanding if len<=16 then value takes max 128 bits, while len takes (15?) bits. But you don't need 15 bits to store a value up to 16 (you only need 5 bits). What am I missing here?

Ken: More confusingly, Tact-by-example states that Int as coins;           // range 0 to 2^120 - 1 (takes 120 bit = 15 bytes)

Behrang: More details here:  https://t.me/tondev_eng/42653 (reply to 20772)

Ken: This is the confusing part of the documentation then ``` #< x - Nat less than x bit unsigned integer stored as lenBits(x - 1) bits, up to 31 bits It should be #< x - Nat less than x, stored as lenBits(x - 1) bits unsigned integer, up to 31 bits ```

Boris: you can‚Äôt get the public key directly from the address, a keypair can have multiple addresses. However, you can get the publicKey from the wallet contract (reply to 21123)

Baldwin: Who have sample contract nft for tact language?  I only sample for jetton

Vlad: Is there a way to store integer as a slice in cell?

Sonny: Hi , Hello, I want to get the token price, how can I do that?

reverie: hi anyone knows how to the token master from transfer_notification

reverie: like someone transfer A token to wallet owned by contractB, however contractB has no idea to know the which token right?

Sa: could you share your jetton sample ? (reply to 21189)

reverie: for instance    body: TokenNotification { // 0x7362d09c -- Remind the new Owner                         query_id: msg.query_id,                         amount: msg.amount,                         from: msg.from,                         forward_payload: msg.forward_payload                     }.toCell()

reverie: after transfer , notification will be sent, however, the receiver has no idea  what is the token master, only amount and from is known

Baldwin: check it https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard (reply to 21199)

Spetsnaz: I'm trying to get around extensions, but something is not clear. I know they can extend, for example, an Int and add methods to it. But what I'm trying to achieve is:  I have a trait that defines a function: foo, in the contract, I want to extend the functionnality of that foo function to do additional stuff.  The only work around I thought of is to send() a message to the same address of the contract.

Marcus: I believe it's because self.mint has a SendRemainingBalance call inside, and the cashback in your case is sent to self.owner, not myAddress(). So that means your next self.mint will fail because it doesn't have enough to pay for gas (reply to 21271)

I have a method in smart contract: get fun verify_sign(data: Slice, signature: Slice): Bool {   return checkDataSignature(data, signature, self.public_key); } I want to test it with blueprint tests. I'm trying to run: const data = beginCell(); data.storeUint(123,32); data.endCell();  // validatorPrivateKey is the key for self.public_key in contract const signature = naclSign(data.asCell().hash(), validatorPrivateKey); const signatureSlice = beginCell().storeBuffer(signature).endCell();  const result = await nftCollection.getVerifySign(data.asCell(), signatureSlice);  console.log(result); But it returns false in result. Why?  P.S. naclSign is an alias for nacl.sign from ton-crypto

Spetsnaz: Hey guys. I know that on TON, things are asynchronous and we can‚Äôt just query directly the contract to know the balance. So the solution is to build notifications to send back. This is fine.  What about querying Jettons which are outside of my control? I would like to know the balance of a certain Jetton (which I have the address of) from my contract in the sender‚Äôs wallet.  Any way to query standard Jettons asynchronously to get the balance?

‚Äî 2024-04-21 ‚Äî

Yakitori: I'm curious about this too (reply to 21930)

Spetsnaz: I think the logic should be to init the default jetton contract with the sender's address, but I wonder where to go from there (reply to 21930)

Yakitori: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard if you check this contract, there is no way to get the balance from an internal call? (reply to 21942)

Spetsnaz: It‚Äôs not about that. I have FooContract for example which is not a Jetton. I want to know the balance of JettonX of the sender()‚Äôs wallet from within FooContract (reply to 21947)

Spetsnaz: It‚Äôs not possible to query the Jetton directly and getters do not work (reply to 21948)

Spetsnaz: Trying to find a way in Tact (better) or FunC to know the balance of JettonX that the sender() is holding (reply to 21949)

Yakitori: I understand, I'm looking for the same thing (reply to 21950)

Yakitori: https://tonresear.ch/t/tep-137-enhancing-jetton-wallets-introducing-onchain-balance-queries/154 (reply to 21950)

Yakitori: It isn't implemented in most deployed wallets

Yakitori: kek goodbye any hopes of composability

Spetsnaz: Got it. How does then Tonkeeper and the likes know all the jettons a wallet is holding?

Yakitori: 2024 it's time üò¨

Yakitori: Getter functions allow you to query off-chain (reply to 21956)

Spetsnaz: I know, but the exploration of the jettons a wallet has

Yakitori: tl;dr you can read the state off-chain but not on chain

Spetsnaz: So a wallet has multiple smart contracts to represent Jetton Wallets. I see no where in the main Jetton Master to know how many jettons, even off-chain

Yakitori: I think that they run an indexing program that parses the transactions to see it (reply to 21959)

Spetsnaz: Got it, I'll have to look for some apis that can help with this then (reply to 21962)

Yakitori: You can use Tonkeeper's API

Diego: hello everyone, its just i'm starting with Tact and I'm reading in the Ton docs that replay should be avoided for security reasons, does anyone know how to implement such validations in tact? thanks in advance

Yakitori: It's mainly with Jetton wallets, usually setting a nonce is sufficient I think? (reply to 22142)

Diego: a nonce is a seqno? or is it something different?

Yakitori: Yeah (reply to 22146)

Diego: thanks a lot

Yakitori: Just like with Ethereum, each transaction has a nonce number that increases with each transaction

Yakitori: So you can't replay an old transaction with a lower nonce

Diego: great tks again for the explanation, is just I forgot to mention I'm also new to blockchain in general lol

Diego: but I think I get it its just a way to check its not the same message given it a number

Yakitori: You can add a counter held in the state of the contract, and when you pass a transaction you need to give a nonce. (reply to 22152)

Diego: I guess i should get the next id from a getter function and add this id to the message im going to send and then check it

Yakitori: If the nonce is lower or equal to the current nonce, you revert

Yakitori: And if the transaction is valid, update the counter

Diego: thanks a lot Yakitori

Yakitori: I'm a Solidity dev, but Tact noob so haha let's help each others out ! (reply to 22157)

Diego: btw getting next id doesn't have problems of concurrency?

Diego: like 2 different proccesses consuming the same id?

Yakitori: Humm I don't think so - usually a nonce will be used for the user endpoint (his wallet for instance), so unless he sends 2 transactions with the same nonce at the same time there wouldn't be a problem? (reply to 22159)

Diego: oh ok I get it

Miras: hi! you can omit the hash in the message because Tact automatically generates them (but you can overwrite it if you wish)  https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/structs-and-messages#messages (reply to 22209)

Jimmy Becen: tks you! (reply to 22210)

Pike ü¶¥ üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è: does modifying this to a random hash affect the function functionality? (reply to 22211)

Daniil: It‚Äôs recommended to just let Tact decide the opcode for you (reply to 22213)

Pike ü¶¥ üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è: thanks for the answers ‚ù§Ô∏è

Sonny: I am doing the token staking function, how can I let users transfer tokens to the contract

Yakitori: Have the users send the tokens to the contract wallet and record their stake when the contract wallet notifies the staking contract (reply to 22230)

Yakitori: Btw Tact is really great, much easier to learn for noobs, and to handle the TON quirks

Yakitori: I'm learning by porting a famous ERC contract and for now I can focus on the architecture without having to figure out the bit layout like in FunC

Yakitori: Which for my small brain would be very hard to handle

Sonny: So what message will I use to transfer tokens to the TokenTransfer TokenTransferInternal TokenNotification contract?

Yakitori: TokenNotification (reply to 22235)

Yakitori: Also you can rename the message to Deposit for instance!

Sonny: Let me ask what is the difference between TokenTransfer TokenTransferInternal TokenNotification

Yakitori: I'm on my phone right now, I'd suggest that you check the Jetton Tact contract in the cookbook section (reply to 22238)

Sonny: Tks very much (reply to 22239)

Yakitori: If you have more questions  please ask I'm learning too (reply to 22240)

Yakitori: Also let's make this chat comfy asf for tact devs!

Sonny: I'm writing a simple token staking contract, like 1 month 3 months... (reply to 22241)

dd: What am I doing wrong, not one of my messages got any response lmao

dd: How to build

encs: @yakito_ri

encs: I m trying to deploy a jetton. What data should I pass to the "cell"?

Sa: could you share your contract source code (reply to 22243)

encs: Any idea what should I pass to cell?

Sonny: I'm starting to write, when I finish I will DM you (reply to 22250)

Daniil: createOffchainContent("https://link_to_metadata.json") (reply to 22252)

Sa: Ah. Sorry. I thought you already finished it. (reply to 22253)

encs: Understood

encs: Thanks (reply to 22254)

Sonny: Have you completed any projects yet? (reply to 22255)

Yakitori: https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md (reply to 22252)

Yakitori: It's the metadata

encs: Love you

Sonny: Pass Cell  is normally info metadata for contract master (reply to 22252)

Sa: I‚Äôm learning (reply to 22258)

encs: any idea how to generate the content: Cell for the jetton? (reply to 22262)

encs: init(content: Cell) {         self.owner = sender(); // we can initialize owner to any value we want, the deployer in this case         self.totalSupply = 0;         self.max_supply = 100000000;         self.mintable = true;         self.content = content;         self.mint(self.owner, self.max_supply, self.owner);     }

encs: cannot really find the way it should be

encs: can you give me a hand? (reply to 22254)

encs: i want to pass that info on-chain, is that possible?

Daniil: it is, but there's no function for that in stdlib, so you'll have to do it manually by composing a dictionary with metadata (reply to 22281)

encs: ooh

encs: @Gusarich another question, how can I use the receive() function to receive a specific JETTON, i have a list of jettons I want to accept, how can I check that? thanks

Ken: you check the jetton wallet address (reply to 22287)

encs: Understood

encs: Thanks
